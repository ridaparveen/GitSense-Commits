# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 12:07:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` and `searchOptions.ts` on September 23, 2025.  The  `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file underwent several minor updates between 9:55 AM and 11:38 AM, primarily involving null checks added to handle optional fields in the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` and `UpdateVesselAndVoyage` functions. These changes ensure that null values are appropriately handled during database operations, preventing potential errors.  The `pol_eta`, `pol_etd`, `pol_atd`, `port_cuttoff`, `stuffing_cuttoff`, and `vgm_cuttoff` fields were modified to allow null values.  No significant functional changes were introduced in the other functions during these revisions.


The `searchOptions.ts` file and `optionQuery.ts` file were modified between 11:44 AM and 11:57 AM.  These changes focused on enhancing the search functionality. The most significant change was in `optionQuery.ts`'s `getVessel` method, where the query was rewritten to include a `LEFT JOIN` with the `routing` table to retrieve additional voyage details. This update  expanded the data retrieved for vessel searches, improving the completeness of the autocomplete results in the `searchOptions.ts` file.  The changes to  `searchOptions.ts`  simply updated calls to the improved `getVessel` method.


## 12:07:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to vessel and voyage management in a React application.  The most significant changes occur in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 9:52:33 AM:**  Initial commit of the form component. This version uses `useFormik` for form management, `useSelector` to access Redux state, and includes various input fields (InputBox, AutocompleteSearch, CheckboxField, InputGroupedButton), a DynamicEditableTable for routing details, and a modal for adding vessel information.  The form handles both "add" and "edit" modes.

* **9/23/2025, 9:59:49 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 10:00:32 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 10:02:05 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 11:53:23 AM:** The `endpointKey` for the `InputGroupedButton` component (Vessel Name) is changed from `"vessel-voyage"` to `"vessel"`, likely to fetch vessel options from a different endpoint.

* **9/23/2025, 12:04:50 AM:** The `onObjectChange` handler for the Vessel Name input is refactored into a separate function `populateValueWithSearch`.  This function updates multiple form fields based on the selected vessel.

* **9/23/2025, 12:06:13 AM:**  The `populateValueWithSearch` function is modified. The commented out code suggests an earlier version attempted to update more fields automatically but this was likely reverted.  A `console.log` statement was added to help debug the selection process.

* **9/23/2025, 12:07:10 AM:** The `populateValueWithSearch` function is further revised to correctly update the `formik.values` with selected vessel information.


**`VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 9:56:35 AM:** Initial commit of the page component. This version fetches vessel and voyage details using RTK Query (`useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery`), handles both "add" and "edit" modes based on URL parameters, and includes a status dropdown. The `useEffect` hook handles the initial state and populates the form with data in edit mode.  Date values are parsed to remove time components.

* **9/23/2025, 9:59:29 AM:** This revision corrects how the data is accessed from the `vesselDetails` object. The access path was changed from `vesselDetails.vesselVoyage[0]` to `vesselDetails.data[0]`.


**`optionService.ts` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 11:53:03 AM:**  This file introduces functions for fetching and normalizing options for various components, including a `normalizeOption` function that handles different endpoint keys to adjust the option structure appropriately for each type of data.


* **9/23/2025, 11:59:52 AM:** The `normalizeOption` function is updated to include the `raw` property in the object returned for the `vessel` endpoint, improving data handling consistency.

**`voyageDashboardSlice.ts` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 10:05:51 AM:** Initial commit creating a Redux slice for managing voyage dashboard state, including pagination, filters, and sorting options. The initial state sets the page number to 0.

* **9/23/2025, 10:06:09 AM:** The initial page number in the pagination state is corrected to 1.

* **9/23/2025, 10:14:52 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, with multiple minor revisions to the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` to improve functionality and data handling. The change in the data access path in `VesselVoyageDetailsPage` highlights the importance of adapting to potential API response variations.  The introduction of `optionService.ts` standardizes the handling of options across the application.  The final changes in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` focus on streamlining the updating of form fields when a vessel is selected.
