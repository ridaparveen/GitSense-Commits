# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 12:07:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` and `searchOptions.ts` on September 23, 2025.  The  `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file underwent several minor updates between 9:55 AM and 11:38 AM, primarily involving null checks added to handle optional fields in the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` and `UpdateVesselAndVoyage` functions. These changes ensure that null values are appropriately handled during database operations, preventing potential errors.  The `pol_eta`, `pol_etd`, `pol_atd`, `port_cuttoff`, `stuffing_cuttoff`, and `vgm_cuttoff` fields were modified to allow null values.  No significant functional changes were introduced in the other functions during these revisions.


The `searchOptions.ts` file and `optionQuery.ts` file were modified between 11:44 AM and 11:57 AM.  These changes focused on enhancing the search functionality. The most significant change was in `optionQuery.ts`'s `getVessel` method, where the query was rewritten to include a `LEFT JOIN` with the `routing` table to retrieve additional voyage details. This update  expanded the data retrieved for vessel searches, improving the completeness of the autocomplete results in the `searchOptions.ts` file.  The changes to  `searchOptions.ts`  simply updated calls to the improved `getVessel` method.


## 12:07:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to vessel and voyage management in a React application.  The most significant changes occur in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 9:52:33 AM:**  Initial commit of the form component. This version uses `useFormik` for form management, `useSelector` to access Redux state, and includes various input fields (InputBox, AutocompleteSearch, CheckboxField, InputGroupedButton), a DynamicEditableTable for routing details, and a modal for adding vessel information.  The form handles both "add" and "edit" modes.

* **9/23/2025, 9:59:49 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 10:00:32 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 10:02:05 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 11:53:23 AM:** The `endpointKey` for the `InputGroupedButton` component (Vessel Name) is changed from `"vessel-voyage"` to `"vessel"`, likely to fetch vessel options from a different endpoint.

* **9/23/2025, 12:04:50 AM:** The `onObjectChange` handler for the Vessel Name input is refactored into a separate function `populateValueWithSearch`.  This function updates multiple form fields based on the selected vessel.

* **9/23/2025, 12:06:13 AM:**  The `populateValueWithSearch` function is modified. The commented out code suggests an earlier version attempted to update more fields automatically but this was likely reverted.  A `console.log` statement was added to help debug the selection process.

* **9/23/2025, 12:07:10 AM:** The `populateValueWithSearch` function is further revised to correctly update the `formik.values` with selected vessel information.


**`VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 9:56:35 AM:** Initial commit of the page component. This version fetches vessel and voyage details using RTK Query (`useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery`), handles both "add" and "edit" modes based on URL parameters, and includes a status dropdown. The `useEffect` hook handles the initial state and populates the form with data in edit mode.  Date values are parsed to remove time components.

* **9/23/2025, 9:59:29 AM:** This revision corrects how the data is accessed from the `vesselDetails` object. The access path was changed from `vesselDetails.vesselVoyage[0]` to `vesselDetails.data[0]`.


**`optionService.ts` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 11:53:03 AM:**  This file introduces functions for fetching and normalizing options for various components, including a `normalizeOption` function that handles different endpoint keys to adjust the option structure appropriately for each type of data.


* **9/23/2025, 11:59:52 AM:** The `normalizeOption` function is updated to include the `raw` property in the object returned for the `vessel` endpoint, improving data handling consistency.

**`voyageDashboardSlice.ts` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 10:05:51 AM:** Initial commit creating a Redux slice for managing voyage dashboard state, including pagination, filters, and sorting options. The initial state sets the page number to 0.

* **9/23/2025, 10:06:09 AM:** The initial page number in the pagination state is corrected to 1.

* **9/23/2025, 10:14:52 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, with multiple minor revisions to the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` to improve functionality and data handling. The change in the data access path in `VesselVoyageDetailsPage` highlights the importance of adapting to potential API response variations.  The introduction of `optionService.ts` standardizes the handling of options across the application.  The final changes in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` focus on streamlining the updating of form fields when a vessel is selected.


## 1:08:01 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`, both related to a Vessel Voyage details form and page.  The majority of changes center around `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` Changes:**

The primary focus of the modifications in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` is the handling of data related to vessel selection and its subsequent population of other form fields, including the routing list.

* **Initial versions (9/23/2025, 12:08:31 PM and 12:09:28 PM):**  These versions define a form component using `Formik` and `react-redux`.  The form handles various inputs for vessel voyage details, including a dynamic editable table for routing details using `DynamicEditableTable`. A modal (`BaseModal`) is implemented for adding new vessel information using `VesselDetailsForm`.  The initial implementations used a custom `populateValueWithSearch` function to update formik values.


* **Intermediate Versions (9/23/2025, 12:13:24 PM - 12:32:03 PM):**  Several commits refined the `onObjectChange` handler within the `InputGroupedButton` component, which populates various form fields based on the selected vessel. The initial approach involved directly setting the formik values using `formik.setValues()`. Later iterations changed to use `formik.setFieldValue()` for individual field updates, improving maintainability and reducing potential errors.  There was also an attempt to add a single routing list item when a vessel was selected.

* **Refined Routing List Handling (9/23/2025, 12:31:50 PM - 12:57:58 PM):** A significant improvement was made in how the routing list is managed. Initially, the selected vessel's routing data overwrote the existing routing list. The final versions changed to use `formik.setFieldValue` to append the selected vesselâ€™s routing information to the existing routing list, allowing multiple entries. Further refinements involved cleaning up redundant code and simplifying logic using spread syntax to update the Formik values. There was also a change to handle clearing the search which would in turn clear all related fields within the form.


* **Final Version (9/23/2025, 1:00:15 PM - 1:04:08 PM):** The `onObjectChange` handler of `InputGroupedButton` was extracted into a dedicated `populateVesselData` function, thereby improving code organization and readability.  Error handling was added for when no search is selected.  Additionally, the `value` prop in `InputBox` was updated to use the nullish coalescing operator (`|| ""`).


**`VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` Changes:**

The modifications to `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` are primarily focused on data fetching, initial state management, and handling the "add" and "edit" modes.

* **Initial Version (9/23/2025, 12:13:47 PM):**  This version defines a page component using `react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, and custom components. It fetches vessel voyage details using `useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery` based on the route parameters.  It initialized the form's initial values.

* **Subsequent Versions (9/23/2025, 12:14:29 PM - 12:50:17 PM):** These commits made refinements to data handling and state updates within the useEffect hooks to accurately populate the form in "edit" mode. In particular, the timestamps of `pol_eta`, `pol_etd`, `pol_atd`, `port_cuttoff`, `stuffing_cuttoff`, and `vgm_cuttoff` fields in `vessalData` were adjusted to only include the date part. `atd_pod` was added as a field in both the `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`. Finally, an empty routing list was added to `vessalData`'s initial state.


* **Final Version (9/23/2025, 12:50:17 PM):**  No significant functional changes were introduced.



**Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of Formik for form management.
* Frequent updates to the `formik.setFieldValue` method to update individual fields.
* Extensive use of optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators to handle potentially null or undefined values.
* Date parsing from strings containing time information to strings only including the date.


The overall pattern reveals a gradual refinement of the form's data handling logic, particularly focusing on improving the management of the routing list and the update mechanism after selecting a vessel. The changes indicate a focus on both functionality and maintainability.


## 4:09:41 PM
The log shows modifications to `vendorServices.ts`  between 4:07 PM and 4:09 PM on September 23, 2025.  The file contains API endpoints for managing vendor data (getAll, addVendor, updateVendor).

The primary changes revolve around the `getAll` function.  Initially, the `page` and `perPage` parameters in the `getAll` function were explicitly set to 1 and 10, respectively.  These were subsequently changed to allow flexible values from the request query.  A logging statement in `getAll` was also enhanced to include `perPage` and the entire `req.query` object for debugging purposes.  Finally, a logging statement was added to print the `mainData` received from the database query.  These modifications suggest improvements to the pagination logic and enhanced logging for debugging.  No significant changes were made to `addVendor` or `updateVendor` functions throughout the log.  The code consistently uses a custom `QueryBuilder` class, `insertQuery`, `query`, and `updateQuery` functions from a common utility module to interact with the database.  Error handling remains consistent, logging errors to the console and returning appropriate HTTP status codes to the client.


## 4:10:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within the `envosys-frontend` project on September 23rd, 2025.  The main focus is on the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` component and related files.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`**: This component underwent significant changes throughout the log.  Initial versions show a form for adding and editing vessel voyage details, utilizing `formik` for form handling, `react-redux` for state management, and various UI components from a custom component library.  Subsequent changes involved adding a modal for adding new vessels (`BaseModal` and `VesselDetailsForm`), integrating date pickers for various date fields, and improving the handling of routing list data.  A crucial update at 1:37:01 PM included the integration of `useSaveVesselMutation` from `store/api/vesselDataApi` and `react-hot-toast` for user feedback on vessel saving. Further refinements removed unnecessary console logs and adjusted the `vesselSaveData` call within the `onSubmit` handler of the `VesselDetailsForm`.  The final version at 1:42:16 PM refactored the `vesselSaveData` hook declaration to be outside the component's functional body, improving organization.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\common\tailwind_common\input-grouped-button.tsx`**: This file was modified twice, between 1:19:56 PM and 1:24:13 PM. The changes primarily focused on the `InputGroupedButton` component.  Initially, it had two export functions: `InputGroupedButton` and `InputGroupedButtonWithSearch`.  The final version removed the `InputGroupedButtonWithSearch` function and changed the `onValueChange` prop to `onChange` in the default `InputGroupedButton` function, simplifying the component.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\common\tailwind_common\autoCompleteSearch.tsx`**: This component, updated at 1:27:16 PM, is an auto-complete search box that fetches options dynamically using an `endpointKey` and the `getOptions` function.  It manages input value, options, and error handling. The key feature is its ability to fetch options based on user input and provide feedback via a message, loading indicator, and error display.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`**:  This page, modified at 1:42:44 PM, acts as a container for `VesselVoyageDetailsForm`. It uses `react-router-dom` for navigation, `react-redux` for state management, and RTK Query's `useCreateVoygeMutation`, `useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery`, and `useUpdateVoyageMutation` hooks to interact with backend APIs for creating and updating vessel voyages. It also uses a select box to handle the status field and handles UI feedback through `react-hot-toast`.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\vendorDataApi.ts`**: This file defines API slices for fetching and managing vendor data. The initial version (3:21:51 PM) had endpoints related to vessel data; however, these were quickly corrected to point towards vendor-related endpoints in subsequent commits (3:22:15 PM and 3:23:22 PM). The final version correctly uses `/api/vendor` endpoints for vendor management and dashboard data.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\VendorDashboard.tsx`**: This component, heavily modified between 3:24:58 PM and 4:06:05 PM, displays a vendor dashboard.  It uses `react-redux` to access and update the application state, includes search and filtering capabilities, and allows data export to Excel.  Initial versions used dummy data; however, updates at 3:25:38 PM integrated  `useFetchVendorDashboardDataQuery` from `vendorDataApi` to fetch data from the backend. Further updates at 4:00:18 PM, 4:02:20 PM, and 4:05:38 PM focused on integrating redux actions to manage pagination and using the pagination parameters from the store in the API request.  This ensured that the pagination model is always synchronized with the redux store. The final change included handling pagination state within redux and passing the page and pageSize parameters correctly to the API call.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`**: This file configures the Redux store, adding `vendorDataApi` middleware at 3:26:45 PM.  A later update (3:54:45 PM) included the `vesndorDashboardSlice` reducer.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\vendor-columns.tsx`**: This file contains column definitions for vendor-related tables.  The significant changes from 3:35:49 PM to 3:51:14 PM involve refining the `VENDOR_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` function to utilize the `DASHBOARD_STATUS` object from `data/options/common.ts` for dynamic status badge coloring. This allows for consistent status representation across the application.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\options\common.ts`**: This file defines various common options and constants used throughout the application. The addition of `DASHBOARD_STATUS` at 3:47:29 PM provides a centralized way to map statuses to colors, improving maintainability and consistency.


**Recurring Elements**:  Frequent use of `formik`, `react-redux`, RTK Query, custom component libraries, and a consistent naming convention are observed throughout the codebase.  There's a strong emphasis on efficient data handling and user experience through feedback mechanisms.  The changes are incremental, reflecting iterative development practices.


## 5:13:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `vendorServices.ts` file and one revision to the `vendor.ts` file, all within a short time frame on September 23, 2025.

The `vendor.ts` file (4:14:38 PM) was modified to change the `GetVendorParams` interface.  The `pageSize` property was renamed to `perPage`.

The `vendorServices.ts` file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on the `getAll` function.  The initial versions (4:10:34 PM and 4:11:10 PM) contained bugs in pagination logic and inconsistent use of `pageSize` and `perPage` variables.  Subsequent revisions (4:14:15 PM, 4:14:25 PM, 4:22:43 PM, 4:23:55 PM, 4:26:28 PM, and 4:53:56 PM) addressed these issues, primarily by correcting the calculation of the `offset` in the pagination.  There was also a change made where the initial value of `page` changed from `0` to `1`.The final version at 4:53:56 PM removed unnecessary console logging statements.  The `addVendor` and `updateVendor` functions remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.  The overall pattern indicates debugging and refinement of the `getAll` function's pagination handling.


## 5:14:00 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on a React application's vendor dashboard component (`VendorDashboard.tsx`) and its related Redux store slice (`vendorDashboardSlice.ts`).  The changes span approximately one hour (from 4:12 PM to 4:59 PM).

**`VendorDashboard.tsx` Changes:**

* **Initial State (4:12 PM):** The component was initially implemented, fetching vendor data using `useFetchVendorDashboardDataQuery`, displaying it in a data grid (`AppGrid`), and including search, filtering, sorting, and export to Excel functionality.  The pagination model was initially set to `page: 0, pageSize: 5`.  The `vendorDashboardSelector` had a typo in the selector name.

* **Pagination Update (4:13 PM, 4:20 PM, 4:29 PM, 4:31 PM, 4:38 PM, 4:40 PM):**  Multiple revisions refined the pagination handling. The `paginationModel` was directly sourced from the API response, correcting its update mechanism from redux, and ensuring consistency between frontend and backend pagination.  The `handlePage` function was modified to handle both page and pageSize from the DataGrid and  to convert the 0-based index from `AppGrid` to a 1-based index for the API.

* **Search and Filtering Improvements (4:45 PM, 4:51 PM, 4:53 PM, 4:57 PM):** The search functionality (`handleSearch`) was improved;  the search term was integrated into API request. Filter functionality (`handleFilterChange`, `handleClearFilters`) was added, allowing users to filter data based on various criteria, with these changes propagating to the API call via `useFetchVendorDashboardDataQuery`. The filter options for "status" were updated to reflect "ACTIVE" and "INACTIVE".  The search input's `name` attribute was corrected to `vendor_name`.  The sort dropdown was updated to show the selected value. The `access` object was updated to reflect correct permissions and the `handleFilterUpdate` was removed as the changes were done in `handleFilterChange`.

* **Sort Functionality Enhancement (4:43 PM, 4:48 PM, 4:51 PM, 4:53 PM, 4:57 PM):** The sort functionality (`handleSortChange`) was enhanced to dispatch an action (`setVendorDashboardSortBy`) updating the Redux store and triggering a data refresh.  The `sortOptions` were replaced with `VendorSortOptions` from `data/options/common.ts` to provide vendor-specific sorting options.


**`vendorDashboardSlice.ts` Changes:**

* **Initial State and Reducers (4:13 PM, 4:15 PM, 4:16 PM, 4:20 PM, 4:23 PM, 4:32 PM):** This slice manages the vendor dashboard's state in Redux.  The initial `page` value in the `pagination` was changed multiple times between 0 and 1, finally settling on 1. The initial state was consistently refined to include various filters, including `fromDate`, `toDate`, `status`, `vendor_name`, and `serial_id`.  No significant functional changes, only small tweaks to initial states and parameters.

* **No Changes** between the rest of the timestamps for this file.

**`datagrid.tsx` Changes:**

* **Pagination Update (4:22 PM, 4:22 PM, 4:36 PM, 4:37 PM):** The `AppGrid` component was modified to correctly send both `newPage` and `newPageSize` to the `onPageChange` handler.  There was a brief incorrect typing of `onPageChange` as optional, which was corrected.  Finally, the `onPageChange` function was changed to only accept `newPage` parameter.


**`action.tsx` Changes:**

* **Action Creation (4:56 PM, 4:58 PM, 4:59 PM):**  This file defines actions for the vendor dashboard.  The navigation path for editing vendors was corrected to the appropriate path `/app/master/vendor/new_vendor`.  The initial version was pointing to the vessel editing path.  The `access` object was updated to `vendorMenu` boolean for correct conditional rendering of Edit button.

**Overall Pattern:**

The changes show a clear iterative development process.  The developers focused on improving the pagination, search, filtering, and sorting features of the vendor dashboard component, ensuring that changes are reflected in the API request and that it interacts correctly with the Redux store.  The initial implementation had several minor bugs that were incrementally resolved.  There is a repeated pattern of updating the Redux store whenever pagination, filtering, or sorting actions occur.
