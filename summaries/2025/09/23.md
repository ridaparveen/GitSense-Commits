# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 12:07:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` and `searchOptions.ts` on September 23, 2025.  The  `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file underwent several minor updates between 9:55 AM and 11:38 AM, primarily involving null checks added to handle optional fields in the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` and `UpdateVesselAndVoyage` functions. These changes ensure that null values are appropriately handled during database operations, preventing potential errors.  The `pol_eta`, `pol_etd`, `pol_atd`, `port_cuttoff`, `stuffing_cuttoff`, and `vgm_cuttoff` fields were modified to allow null values.  No significant functional changes were introduced in the other functions during these revisions.


The `searchOptions.ts` file and `optionQuery.ts` file were modified between 11:44 AM and 11:57 AM.  These changes focused on enhancing the search functionality. The most significant change was in `optionQuery.ts`'s `getVessel` method, where the query was rewritten to include a `LEFT JOIN` with the `routing` table to retrieve additional voyage details. This update  expanded the data retrieved for vessel searches, improving the completeness of the autocomplete results in the `searchOptions.ts` file.  The changes to  `searchOptions.ts`  simply updated calls to the improved `getVessel` method.
