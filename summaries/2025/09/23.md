# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 12:07:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` and `searchOptions.ts` on September 23, 2025.  The  `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file underwent several minor updates between 9:55 AM and 11:38 AM, primarily involving null checks added to handle optional fields in the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` and `UpdateVesselAndVoyage` functions. These changes ensure that null values are appropriately handled during database operations, preventing potential errors.  The `pol_eta`, `pol_etd`, `pol_atd`, `port_cuttoff`, `stuffing_cuttoff`, and `vgm_cuttoff` fields were modified to allow null values.  No significant functional changes were introduced in the other functions during these revisions.


The `searchOptions.ts` file and `optionQuery.ts` file were modified between 11:44 AM and 11:57 AM.  These changes focused on enhancing the search functionality. The most significant change was in `optionQuery.ts`'s `getVessel` method, where the query was rewritten to include a `LEFT JOIN` with the `routing` table to retrieve additional voyage details. This update  expanded the data retrieved for vessel searches, improving the completeness of the autocomplete results in the `searchOptions.ts` file.  The changes to  `searchOptions.ts`  simply updated calls to the improved `getVessel` method.


## 12:07:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to vessel and voyage management in a React application.  The most significant changes occur in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 9:52:33 AM:**  Initial commit of the form component. This version uses `useFormik` for form management, `useSelector` to access Redux state, and includes various input fields (InputBox, AutocompleteSearch, CheckboxField, InputGroupedButton), a DynamicEditableTable for routing details, and a modal for adding vessel information.  The form handles both "add" and "edit" modes.

* **9/23/2025, 9:59:49 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 10:00:32 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 10:02:05 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.

* **9/23/2025, 11:53:23 AM:** The `endpointKey` for the `InputGroupedButton` component (Vessel Name) is changed from `"vessel-voyage"` to `"vessel"`, likely to fetch vessel options from a different endpoint.

* **9/23/2025, 12:04:50 AM:** The `onObjectChange` handler for the Vessel Name input is refactored into a separate function `populateValueWithSearch`.  This function updates multiple form fields based on the selected vessel.

* **9/23/2025, 12:06:13 AM:**  The `populateValueWithSearch` function is modified. The commented out code suggests an earlier version attempted to update more fields automatically but this was likely reverted.  A `console.log` statement was added to help debug the selection process.

* **9/23/2025, 12:07:10 AM:** The `populateValueWithSearch` function is further revised to correctly update the `formik.values` with selected vessel information.


**`VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 9:56:35 AM:** Initial commit of the page component. This version fetches vessel and voyage details using RTK Query (`useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery`), handles both "add" and "edit" modes based on URL parameters, and includes a status dropdown. The `useEffect` hook handles the initial state and populates the form with data in edit mode.  Date values are parsed to remove time components.

* **9/23/2025, 9:59:29 AM:** This revision corrects how the data is accessed from the `vesselDetails` object. The access path was changed from `vesselDetails.vesselVoyage[0]` to `vesselDetails.data[0]`.


**`optionService.ts` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 11:53:03 AM:**  This file introduces functions for fetching and normalizing options for various components, including a `normalizeOption` function that handles different endpoint keys to adjust the option structure appropriately for each type of data.


* **9/23/2025, 11:59:52 AM:** The `normalizeOption` function is updated to include the `raw` property in the object returned for the `vessel` endpoint, improving data handling consistency.

**`voyageDashboardSlice.ts` Updates:**

* **9/23/2025, 10:05:51 AM:** Initial commit creating a Redux slice for managing voyage dashboard state, including pagination, filters, and sorting options. The initial state sets the page number to 0.

* **9/23/2025, 10:06:09 AM:** The initial page number in the pagination state is corrected to 1.

* **9/23/2025, 10:14:52 AM:** No visible code changes in this commit.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, with multiple minor revisions to the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` to improve functionality and data handling. The change in the data access path in `VesselVoyageDetailsPage` highlights the importance of adapting to potential API response variations.  The introduction of `optionService.ts` standardizes the handling of options across the application.  The final changes in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` focus on streamlining the updating of form fields when a vessel is selected.


## 1:08:01 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`, both related to a Vessel Voyage details form and page.  The majority of changes center around `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` Changes:**

The primary focus of the modifications in `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` is the handling of data related to vessel selection and its subsequent population of other form fields, including the routing list.

* **Initial versions (9/23/2025, 12:08:31 PM and 12:09:28 PM):**  These versions define a form component using `Formik` and `react-redux`.  The form handles various inputs for vessel voyage details, including a dynamic editable table for routing details using `DynamicEditableTable`. A modal (`BaseModal`) is implemented for adding new vessel information using `VesselDetailsForm`.  The initial implementations used a custom `populateValueWithSearch` function to update formik values.


* **Intermediate Versions (9/23/2025, 12:13:24 PM - 12:32:03 PM):**  Several commits refined the `onObjectChange` handler within the `InputGroupedButton` component, which populates various form fields based on the selected vessel. The initial approach involved directly setting the formik values using `formik.setValues()`. Later iterations changed to use `formik.setFieldValue()` for individual field updates, improving maintainability and reducing potential errors.  There was also an attempt to add a single routing list item when a vessel was selected.

* **Refined Routing List Handling (9/23/2025, 12:31:50 PM - 12:57:58 PM):** A significant improvement was made in how the routing list is managed. Initially, the selected vessel's routing data overwrote the existing routing list. The final versions changed to use `formik.setFieldValue` to append the selected vesselâ€™s routing information to the existing routing list, allowing multiple entries. Further refinements involved cleaning up redundant code and simplifying logic using spread syntax to update the Formik values. There was also a change to handle clearing the search which would in turn clear all related fields within the form.


* **Final Version (9/23/2025, 1:00:15 PM - 1:04:08 PM):** The `onObjectChange` handler of `InputGroupedButton` was extracted into a dedicated `populateVesselData` function, thereby improving code organization and readability.  Error handling was added for when no search is selected.  Additionally, the `value` prop in `InputBox` was updated to use the nullish coalescing operator (`|| ""`).


**`VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` Changes:**

The modifications to `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` are primarily focused on data fetching, initial state management, and handling the "add" and "edit" modes.

* **Initial Version (9/23/2025, 12:13:47 PM):**  This version defines a page component using `react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, and custom components. It fetches vessel voyage details using `useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery` based on the route parameters.  It initialized the form's initial values.

* **Subsequent Versions (9/23/2025, 12:14:29 PM - 12:50:17 PM):** These commits made refinements to data handling and state updates within the useEffect hooks to accurately populate the form in "edit" mode. In particular, the timestamps of `pol_eta`, `pol_etd`, `pol_atd`, `port_cuttoff`, `stuffing_cuttoff`, and `vgm_cuttoff` fields in `vessalData` were adjusted to only include the date part. `atd_pod` was added as a field in both the `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`. Finally, an empty routing list was added to `vessalData`'s initial state.


* **Final Version (9/23/2025, 12:50:17 PM):**  No significant functional changes were introduced.



**Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of Formik for form management.
* Frequent updates to the `formik.setFieldValue` method to update individual fields.
* Extensive use of optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators to handle potentially null or undefined values.
* Date parsing from strings containing time information to strings only including the date.


The overall pattern reveals a gradual refinement of the form's data handling logic, particularly focusing on improving the management of the routing list and the update mechanism after selecting a vessel. The changes indicate a focus on both functionality and maintainability.
