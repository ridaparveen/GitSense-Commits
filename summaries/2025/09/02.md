# Activity Summary for 9/2/2025

## 6:10:26 AM
The log shows iterative modifications to the `CustomerDashboard.tsx` component and `customer.types.ts` file within a React application.  The primary focus of the changes is enhancing the customer data display and filtering capabilities.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDashboard.tsx`**:

* **Initial Commit (5:56:39 PM):** The component is initially defined, displaying customer data using  `AppGrid`, incorporating search, filtering (`FilterSidebar`), sorting (`SortDropdown`), and excel export functionality. The initial filter state includes date range, duration, status, and customer ID.  The data fetching is implemented using `useGetCustomerDashboardDataQuery`.  Importantly,  `useSelector` is missing from the import statements.

* **Second Commit (5:56:54 PM):**  Fixes the missing `useSelector` import from `react-redux`. No other functional changes are apparent.

* **Third Commit (5:58:09 PM):** Minor change in the search input within the `InputGroup`.  The `serail_id` field in the filter state is renamed to `serial_id`.

* **Fourth Commit (6:00:24 PM):**  The `handleFilterChange` function's argument type is changed from `FilterType` to `CustomerDashboardState`. This change is later reverted.


* **Fifth Commit (6:02:54 PM):** Several minor code formatting changes improve readability.  The search input now uses `customerDashboardSelector.filters.search` instead of `.serail_id`.

* **Sixth Commit (6:03:23 PM):**  The search input is corrected to use `customerDashboardSelector.search` for the value.


* **Seventh Commit (6:05:22 PM):** The `CustomerDashboardState` interface in `customer.types.ts` is updated to include the `search` property within the `filters` object.  This mirrors the change in the component. The `line_name` property is removed from filters.


* **Eighth Commit (6:05:47 PM):** No significant code changes, primarily formatting adjustments.

* **Ninth Commit (6:07:15 PM):** The `handleFilterChange` function is significantly improved.  The comments highlight the change from updating the entire `CustomerDashboardState` to only updating the `filters` portion within the `CustomerDashboardState`. This is a crucial improvement to prevent unintended state modifications.


* **Tenth Commit (6:12:40 PM):** The `mapOptions` utility function from `utils.ts` is imported and used to dynamically populate the filter options for "status" from data fetched from the API (`customerDashboardData?.options?.status`).

* **Eleventh Commit (6:13:15 PM):** Similar to the previous commit, dynamically populates filter options for "duration" using `customerDashboardData?.options?.customer_type`

* **Twelfth Commit (6:13:44 PM):** Extends the dynamic population of filter options to the "consignee" field using `customerDashboardData?.options?.location`

* **Thirteenth Commit (6:16:16 PM):** Adds a `handleClearFilters` function to clear filters and reset pagination to page 0. The `FilterSidebar` component now uses `handleFilterChange` for `onFiltersChange` and `handleClearFilters` for `onClearFilters`. The filters prop in the `FilterSidebar` component is updated to use the  `customerDashboardSelector.filters` object.


* **Fourteenth Commit (6:17:19 PM):** Minor formatting and no functional changes.


* **Fifteenth Commit (6:17:36 PM):** Removes the `line_name` field from the `CustomerDashboardState` interface.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\customer.types.ts`**:

This file undergoes several updates throughout the log, primarily adding and refining interface definitions related to customer data, filter states, and column configurations for the data grid. The most substantial changes involve the addition of `search` field within the `CustomerDashboardState` interface, reflecting the improved search functionality in the `CustomerDashboard.tsx` component.  There's also the addition of several other interfaces (`KeyPersonalList`, `AlertMappingList`, `FacList`, `GstRejistrationList`, `CustomerFormValues`), likely for use in other parts of the application, suggesting the addition of more complex customer information management features. The `line_name` property was removed from the filters.

**Overall Pattern:** The changes show a clear progression towards a more robust and data-driven customer dashboard. The initial version is functional but is iteratively improved regarding data handling, state management, and dynamic UI updates based on fetched data,  particularly concerning filtering.  The use of Redux for state management is evident throughout.
