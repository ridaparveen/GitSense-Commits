# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:39:58 AM
The log shows three revisions of `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`, all within a short time frame (9/9/2025, between 10:32:13 AM and 10:32:30 AM).  The changes primarily involve removing commented-out code related to `formik`. The initial version uses `formik` for form handling, while the final version removes this, opting for a simpler state management approach using `useState` and directly interacting with Redux store using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.  The UI remains largely consistent across all revisions, displaying customer information and a table of GST locations with edit and delete functionalities. The core functionality of adding, editing, deleting, and submitting GST locations persists throughout.  The removal of the `formik` code represents a significant architectural shift in how the form is managed.


## 11:40:06 AM
The log shows a React component (`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`) undergoing significant revisions between 10:49 AM and 11:39 AM on September 9th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes centers around improving the handling and display of GST location data.

Initially, the component used `useFormik` for form management, but this was later removed, simplifying the code.  A large block of commented-out code related to `formik` is present throughout the file's history.

Early versions struggled with merging GST location data from different sources (state and backend).  This was addressed by introducing a `getValue` helper function (around 11:03 AM) and later, a more concise merge logic using a ternary operator to create `finalGstData` (around 11:09 AM),  prioritizing data from `gstLocations` and falling back to `customerUpdateData`.  The `finalGstData` variable is then used in the `handleSubmit` function to construct the payload.


A key improvement was made at 11:39 AM, altering the `handleSubmit` function. Instead of directly mapping `gstLocations` in the payload, it now uses the `finalGstData` and explicitly names the `gstLocations` key in the payload.


The `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` file is also modified at 11:23 AM.  This component handles individual GST location details. It uses Redux actions (`addGST`, `updateGST`) to manage GST locations in the store. Its changes are primarily related to better navigation and handling of editing existing entries, using the `isEditing` flag and dispatching appropriate Redux actions.  The `serial_id` is used as a unique identifier when adding and updating GST locations.  The component also makes use of an autocomplete component and an interface for  `CustomerRawData`

The `customerDetailsSlice.ts` file (modified at 11:12 AM) introduces Redux reducers for managing lists of customer details, including GST registration details. The reducers allow adding, updating, and removing items from these lists, supporting the functionality of `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` and `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`.  These reducers provide a centralized way to manage customer data within the application's Redux store.


## 12:40:10 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to customer data management in a React application.  The main focus is on GST (Goods and Services Tax) location management.

**`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`:** This component underwent several changes between 11:41 AM and 12:20 PM.  Initial versions used `formik` for form management, but this was later removed.  Significant changes include:

* **11:41:36 AM:** The `status` field was added to the `handleSubmit` payload.
* **12:13:13 PM:** The component was refactored to use Redux for managing GST locations.  `useEffect` hooks were added to load GST locations from the backend and update the component's state accordingly.  Loading indicators were also implemented. A count of GST locations is now displayed.
* **12:17:55 PM:** The `handleAddMore` function was modified to navigate to the `addNewCustomerForm` component, passing either the existing customer ID or the `customer_id` from a found GST row.
* **12:20:15 PM:** The `handleAddMore` function was simplified to always pass the current `customer_id` and explicitly set `isEditing` to `false` for add mode.


**`customer.types.ts`:**  This file, containing type definitions, was updated at 11:42 AM and 11:48 AM, primarily focusing on clarifying types and adding new interfaces related to customer data. The most notable change was the alteration of `CustomerStatus` enum case values from upper camel case to lower camel case between 11:42 AM and 11:48 AM.

**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`:** This component, responsible for adding and updating customer details including GST locations, also underwent significant changes between 12:00 PM and 12:26 PM. Key updates include:

* **12:00:49 PM:** The `customer_id` in the `gstRow` object within the `onSubmit` function was corrected to use `values?.customer_id` instead of relying solely on the location state.
* **12:06:03 PM:** The unnecessary API call (`saveGstLoaction`) inside `onSubmit` was removed; the GST data is now managed entirely through Redux.
* **12:12:24 PM:**  Major refactoring to handle initial values more robustly, extracting them directly from `location.state` and using more descriptive variable names like `customer_id` and `serial_id`.  Added loading indicator.  Improved logging for debugging.
* **12:15:42 PM:**  Removed unused imports and simplified the `handleAddGST` function.
* **12:25:09 PM & 12:26:42 PM:** The `serial_id` generation in `handleAddGST` now correctly uses `Date.now()` only when adding new entries.


**`customerGstLocationSlice.ts`:**  This Redux slice, managing the GST locations state, was modified at 12:13 PM and 12:15 PM. The major change was the removal of `isDataLoaded` and the simplification of unique ID generation for new GST locations.  The `updateGST` reducer now correctly uses the provided `serial_id`.

**`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`:** This component initializes the CustomerDetailsForm with default values.  It shows no significant code changes.


The overall pattern suggests a move from a formik-based approach to a Redux-based approach for managing GST location data, improving data consistency and simplifying the code.  There's a clear emphasis on handling both adding new and updating existing GST locations. The changes also reflect improved error handling and better loading state management.


## 12:40:36 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `customerService.ts` file and `common.ts` file between 10:38 AM and 11:50 AM on September 9, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is on refining the `SaveGstLocation` function within `customerService.ts`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\master\customerService.ts`**:

* **Initial Version (10:38 AM):** This version contained functions for retrieving customer data (`getCustomer`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `GetCustomerDetails`), saving customer details (`saveCustomerDetails`), and a partial implementation of saving GST location data (`SaveGstLocation`). The `SaveGstLocation` function was incomplete, lacking the insertion logic for related tables (`customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, `customer_credit_control`).  It also didn't handle transaction management properly.

* **Intermediate Versions (10:40 AM, 10:47 AM, 10:48 AM):** These versions show no significant code changes, just minor formatting adjustments and no functional changes to the code base.

* **Version with improved `SaveGstLocation` (11:31 AM, 11:32 AM):**  A major update to `SaveGstLocation` completes the implementation by adding the missing insert logic for related tables (`customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, `customer_credit_control`, `customer_fac`). Transaction management (`BEGIN` and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`) was added for improved data integrity.  Empty strings in the input data are converted to `NULL` values using the `sanitizeRow` function.  A new `fetchGstLocationData` function was started but incomplete in this version.


* **Refactoring and Import Changes (11:33 AM):** The `sanitizeRow` and `sanitizeArray` functions were moved from `customerService.ts` to `common.ts`. `customerService.ts` imports `sanitizeRow` from `common.ts`.

* **Further Refinement of `SaveGstLocation` (11:35 AM, 11:40 AM, 11:46 AM):** Additional changes improved the `SaveGstLocation` function. The `insertMany` function was introduced from `database.ts` for better efficiency in inserting multiple GST locations.


* **Final Version (11:50 AM):**  The final version normalizes the `status` field in `SaveGstLocation` to handle both string and array inputs consistently.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\common.ts`**:

* The changes to this file primarily involved refactoring: moving the `sanitizeRow` function from `customerService.ts`. The `sanitizeRow` function now handles the conversion of empty strings to `NULL` values in database rows.  This function was also made `export` instead of just `function`.


**Overall Pattern:** The majority of changes focused on improving the robustness, efficiency, and error handling of the `SaveGstLocation` function in `customerService.ts`. There's a clear evolution towards better database interaction, data sanitization, and transaction management.  The use of  `insertMany`, `sanitizeRow`, and transaction blocks reflects a pattern of improvement in data integrity and performance.


## 1:40:01 PM
The codebase reflects development on a customer GST location management feature within a React application.  Several files were modified between 12:46 PM and 1:08 PM on September 9th, 2025.

The primary focus was on `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`, which displays and manages GST location data.  Initial versions used `useFormik` for form handling, but this was later removed, simplifying the code.  Significant changes involved merging GST location data from both an API (`useFetchCustomerDetailsQuery`) and Redux (`customerFormSlice`). The merging logic ensures that only unique GST locations are displayed, combining data from both sources.  A crucial addition was an `useEffect` hook to populate the Redux store with GST data fetched from the backend, improving initial load efficiency.  The component uses React-Redux for state management and React-Router for navigation between different forms.

The `customerGstLocationSlice.ts` file manages the Redux state for customer GST locations.  The major changes involved the `deleteGST` reducer. Initial attempts to delete based directly on `serial_id` (a number or string) caused type-related errors,  leading to multiple revisions. The final version uses `String()` to ensure consistent type comparison before filtering the array, resolving the deletion issue.  The reducer handles adding, updating, and deleting GST locations, and resetting the entire form state.  The `addGST` reducer prevents duplicate entries based on `serial_id`.


The consistent pattern across the changes indicates a move toward a more streamlined, efficient approach to data management.  The initial reliance on `useFormik` was replaced with a more direct approach, reducing complexity. The final version of `customerGstLocationSlice.ts` demonstrates a focus on robust type handling for reliable state management.  The updates clearly demonstrate iterative debugging and improvement in handling data consistency across API calls and Redux state.


## 1:40:34 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `customerService.ts` file between 1:00 PM and 1:37 PM on September 9, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the `SaveGstLocation` function, which handles saving and updating GST location data.

Initially, `SaveGstLocation` attempted to handle updates and inserts differently, but this was simplified in later revisions.  The final version uses `updateQuery` if a `serial_id` exists, indicating an existing record, otherwise it uses `insertMany` for new records.  Throughout the revisions, there's a consistent pattern of using transaction management (`query("BEGIN");` and `query("COMMIT");` or `query("ROLLBACK");`) to ensure data consistency.  The function also consistently handles and normalizes status updates for both customers and GST locations converting them to lowercase.

The `getCustomer` function remained largely unchanged across all revisions, consistently providing a customer search and retrieval API endpoint.  Similarly, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo` and `saveCustomerDetails` functions showed no significant changes.  A new function `fetchGstLocationData` was added in the final revision.  It appears to fetch all data related to a customer's GST location.

The `customer.ts` file was modified only once at 1:00:32 PM, defining various TypeScript interfaces (`CustomerStatus`, `CustomerQueryType`, `CustomerPayloadTypes`, `CustomerRequestBodyType`, etc.) related to customer data, including nested structures for personal details, alert mappings, credit controls, and facility details.  This file update lays the groundwork for the data structures used in the `customerService.ts` file.


## 3:40:12 PM
The log shows modifications to the `envosys-frontend` project, primarily focused on refactoring API endpoints and adding option fetching and normalization logic.

Between 3:11 PM and 3:14 PM,  `ApiEndPoint.ts`  was updated twice.  The initial version defined endpoints for login, common options, global options, and token verification.  A crucial change occurred at 3:14 PM, altering the `GET_COMMON_OPTIONS` and `GET_GLOBAL_OPTIONS` endpoints to use the `/api/master/autocomplete` base URL, suggesting a migration to a more structured API.  The  `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint remained commented out throughout.

Concurrently, `ApiManager.ts` was modified twice (3:12 PM and 3:12 PM). These commits involved adding imports for `ApiEndPoint` and `ApiMethods`, indicating a restructuring of the API interaction layer.  The `getDateFormat` function was commented out in both revisions.

At 3:22 PM,  `optionService.ts` was created or significantly altered. This file introduces functionality to fetch options from the backend using `ApiManager`, handle option normalization (using `normalizeOption` and `normalizeOptions`), and provide fallback static options.  The  `getOptions` function acts as a unified entry point, prioritizing backend fetching but falling back to static options if necessary.

Finally, at 3:23 PM, `AutoSearchTesting.tsx`  was updated, likely integrating the new option fetching and normalization capabilities into a component using `AutocompleteSearch`.  This component uses the `getOptions` function from `optionService.ts` to populate options for "Sales Export" via the "gst-location" endpointKey.

In summary, the code changes reflect a significant update to the API interaction, implementing a more robust option management system with both dynamic fetching and static fallbacks.  The refactoring of API endpoints points to a possible backend API update or reorganization.  The commented-out `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint and `getDateFormat` function suggest features that may be planned for future implementation or are temporarily disabled.


## 3:40:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `customerService.ts` file, focusing on customer data manipulation and retrieval.  Significant changes occur between 1:40 PM and 1:55 PM, involving the addition and refinement of the `SaveGstLocation` function.  This function initially had commented-out sections for inserting data into related tables (`customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`), which were later uncommented and implemented using `insertQuery` and `updateQuery` based on the presence of a `serial_id`.  Around 1:55 PM, the function was further modified to always use `insertMany` for `customer_gst_location` and then perform separate inserts into other tables using  `insertQuery`.  The return value was also updated to provide more specific information.

Another significant change occurred between 2:51 PM and 3:01 PM in  `UserRepo.ts` and `optionQuery.ts` and `searchOptions.ts` files.  The `OptionQuery` class was added to handle different types of autocomplete queries ("port", "shipper", "mention-users"), and  `searchOptions.ts` was updated to use this class to fetch options based on the request query parameters.


A further modification to `optionQuery.ts` at 3:40:07 PM added a `getGstLocation` method. This method retrieves data from `customer_gst_location` and `customer_key_personal` tables, using joins and `COALESCE` to handle potential null values in the `customer_key_personal` table.


Finally, the routing (`index.ts`) was updated to use a `GET` request instead of `USE` for the autocomplete endpoint at 3:28:49 PM.  Concurrently,  `searchOptions.ts` underwent several revisions between 3:31 PM and 3:38 PM to refine the "gst-location" case in the switch statement. This involved a change in approach from attempting to directly use the result to mapping the results to a {value, label} structure.  The final version at 3:38 PM uses a `LEFT JOIN` in the `getGstLocation` query and reactivates the `gst-location` case in the switch statement of the `getAll` function. The `Paths.ts` file was updated to reflect the new API endpoints.

Throughout the log, there's a consistent pattern of using parameterized queries for database interactions, enhancing security and maintainability. The code also demonstrates robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and appropriate HTTP status codes.


## 4:40:27 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within the `envosys-frontend` project between 3:46 PM and 4:33 PM on September 9, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on improving the `optionService.ts` file to handle various backend response formats for fetching options.

**`ApiEndPoint.ts` (9/9/2025, 3:46:01 PM):** This file defines API endpoints for various actions, including login, fetching common and global options, and token verification.  No further changes were made to this file.

**`optionService.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent significant changes throughout the log.  Initially, it fetched options, handling JSON responses and falling back to static options on error. Subsequent revisions focused on robustly handling different backend response structures.  The `fetchOptions` function was modified to handle scenarios where the backend response contains an `options` array within an object (`{ options: [...] }`) and also where a raw array of options is returned directly. A conditional check was added for `res && typeof res === "object" && "options" in res` to handle the object case, and a check for `Array.isArray(res)` was added to handle the raw array case. Finally, a `field` parameter was added to `fetchOptions` and `getOptions` to allow for more specific data retrieval, and the type of `key` in `getStaticOptions` was changed from `any` to `string`.  The last change reverted the  `fetchOptions` function to only use a simpler conditional check to handle the object case and fallback to static options.


**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component uses `AutocompleteSearch` for several fields.  The initial version used `AutocompleteBox` and had some commented-out code, which were likely placeholders or previous implementations.  Later revisions replaced  `AutocompleteBox` components with `AutocompleteSearch` components, passing the `endpointKey` "gst-location" to retrieve options dynamically and making use of `handleOptionSelect` helper function.  Finally in the last revision, `endpointKey` values were changed for `sales_import`, `cs_export` and `cs_import` to correct functionality.  The primary functionality of this component involves displaying and updating customer details and GST locations using Redux actions (`addGST`, `updateGST`). The `handleAddGST` function updates the state based on whether it's editing or adding a new GST location.

**`ApiManager.ts` (Two Revisions):**  This file manages API calls. The `getCommonOptions` function was initially enhanced to accept an optional `field` parameter to refine the query.  In a later revision, the optional `field` parameter was removed from this function.


In summary, the code changes primarily focused on enhancing error handling and flexibility in the `optionService` to accommodate varying backend responses and adding a `field` parameter for more precise option retrieval. The `CustomerDetailsForm` component was updated to use a more efficient and consistent method for managing the autocomplete functionality, improving the user experience. The changes to `ApiManager.ts` adjusted the handling of the optional `field` parameter. All changes took place within a short timeframe (around one hour).


## 5:40:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `VesselDetailsPage.tsx` between 4:48 PM and 5:39 PM on September 9, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent:  a page for viewing and editing vessel details, fetching data via `useFetchVesselDetailsQuery`, and saving changes with `useSaveVesselMutation`.

The primary changes center around the `status` state and its associated SelectBox component.

* **Initial versions (4:48 PM and 4:49 PM):** The `status` state is initially set to an empty string or the value "active", and updates directly from the `onChange` event of the `SelectBox`.

* **Intermediate versions (4:50 PM - 5:33 PM):**  Several attempts were made to refine how the `status` state is managed.  The `status` state's type was changed to `{ label: string; value: string }` to reflect the structure of the `options` array.  The `onChange` handler was modified to handle the complete object in some instances and only the value in other attempts. There are also redundant code snippets present.


* **Final versions (5:34 PM - 5:39 PM):** The most stable version uses `statusValue` instead of just `status` as a state for the dropdown. The  `useEffect` hook now correctly updates `statusValue` based on fetched `vesselDetails`. The `onChange` handler for the `SelectBox` now correctly updates `statusValue` with the selected value.  The `handleSubmit` function correctly uses `statusValue` when submitting data. The redundant code snippets were removed.  The most significant changes occur between 5:34 PM and 5:39 PM, focusing on improving the handling of the dropdown's state and resolving issues with type handling and state updates.


## 5:41:19 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `searchOptions` service and `optionQuery` utility, along with the addition of a `vessel` service and model.  The updates span from 3:41 PM to 5:32 PM on September 9, 2025.

**`searchOptions.ts` Changes:** This file handles autocomplete API requests.  Initially, the `getAll` function supported queries for "port," "gst-location," and "mention-users."  Later modifications focused on refining the "gst-location" functionality.  The initial implementation used a single query, but this was altered to accept a `field` parameter, specifying which field from the `customer_gst_location` table to search.  Further changes replaced the `field` parameter with a `name` parameter and introduced a `fieldMap` to translate frontend-friendly names to database column names for improved flexibility and error handling.  The final version reverted to a simpler implementation for `gst-location` but added more granular handling of other data types.

**`optionQuery.ts` Changes:** This file defines utility functions for building SQL queries.  The major change involved modifying the `getGstLocation` method. This started by returning a single complex query, then evolved to accept a `field` parameter to dynamically build a query against a specified field within `customer_gst_location`, ultimately reverting to a broader query that included multiple `OR` conditions.


**`vesselService.ts` and `vessel.ts` Additions:** A new service (`vesselService.ts`) and model (`vessel.ts`) were added to handle CRUD operations for vessel data. The service utilizes a `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class for constructing and executing database queries with features like pagination, sorting, filtering, and date range selection.  The code includes functions for getting vessels (`getVessel`), saving vessels (`saveVessel`), fetching vessel data by ID (`fetchVesselData`), and possibly other dashboard-related functions.  Several iterations focused on null/undefined handling in the `saveVessel` function, ensuring that missing fields are properly handled and assigned default values.  The `flag` field in `vessel.ts` was changed from a string to a boolean type, reflecting a change in data type expectation.  The `length` field was also updated from a string to a number to correctly handle numerical values.



The overall pattern in the changes reflects a progressive refinement of the search and data handling capabilities. The initial versions were relatively simple, while later changes focused on improved error handling, flexible querying, and more robust data validation.  The addition of the vessel service suggests an expansion of the application's functionality.


## 6:40:25 PM
The log shows multiple updates to various React components and data structures within a frontend application, primarily focused on vessel and customer details management.

**`VesselDetailsPage.tsx` (9/9/2025, 5:40:52 PM):** This component handles displaying and editing vessel details.  It uses React Router for navigation, RTK Query for fetching and saving vessel data (`useFetchVesselDetailsQuery`, `useSaveVesselMutation`), and React Hot Toast for notifications. The component fetches vessel details based on a `serail_id` passed from the location state,  allowing both creation and editing of vessel records.  The form handles various vessel attributes including status, name, codes, and dimensions.


**`vessel-dashboard-columns.tsx` (9/9/2025, 5:41:42 PM):** This file defines columns for a vessel dashboard table using `@mui/x-data-grid`.  It dynamically renders cell content,  displaying the vessel status with color-coded badges (active/inactive) and includes an action column using a custom menu component (`TMenu`) for actions like editing or deleting vessels.

**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several revisions (6:09:20 PM, 6:12:18 PM, 6:15:02 PM, 6:16:40 PM).  It's a form for managing customer details, using Formik for form handling and Redux for managing GST location data (`addGST`, `updateGST`).  It utilizes several custom components (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `AutocompleteSearch`) and fetches customer details using RTK Query (`useGetCustomerDetailsQuery`).  The significant changes across revisions appear to be refinements and bug fixes, particularly related to how `endpointKey` was handled in the  `AutocompleteSearch`  component, and the  handling of `selected` value to correctly update formik field values. The final version shows a more complete and robust form for managing customer details, including handling of GST locations.

**`ApiManager.ts` (9/9/2025, 6:10:07 PM):** This file defines an API manager class that encapsulates API calls using a custom `ApiMethods` class. It includes methods for login and fetching common options based on endpoint keys, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns.


**`customer-columns.tsx` (9/9/2025, 6:20:06 PM, 9/9/2025, 6:30:56 PM):**  This file defines columns for various customer-related tables, using a custom `EditableTableColumn` type. It includes definitions for GST details, key personnel details, alert mappings, and facility details. These are used likely in a table component allowing for data editability.

**`DynamicEditableTable.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component was heavily revised (6:22:34 PM, 6:30:27 PM, 6:32:19 PM, 6:33:37 PM, 6:38:25 PM, 6:38:57 PM).  It's a dynamic table component allowing users to edit data inline. It supports different input types (`text`, `select`, `date`, `checkbox`, `autosearch`) and uses custom components like `InputBox`, `Checkbox`, and `AutocompleteSearch`. The  major changes involve integrating  `AutocompleteSearch` which is used for autocompletion based on API endpoints specified by `endpointKey` in the column definition. Error handling for undefined or null selected values was also improved. The final revision has improved error handling, simplified some logic, and added more robust handling of both event objects and direct strings for the onValueChange function in the AutocompleteSearch component.


In summary, the code changes reflect the development and refinement of a React application with a focus on data management for vessels and customers.  The use of RTK Query, Formik, and custom components shows a structured approach to building the application.  The multiple revisions of `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` and `DynamicEditableTable.tsx` indicate iterative development and debugging processes.  The consistent use of custom components and interfaces indicates a focus on code reusability and maintainability.


## 6:40:34 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `searchOptions.ts` file between 5:56 PM and 6:23 PM on September 9, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the endpoint handling within the `getAll` function. Initially, the function used a `name` query parameter to determine the endpoint.  This was later changed to `endPoint`, then to `endpointKey`, finally settling on `name` again.  The core functionality remained consistent:  retrieving autocomplete options based on a provided `search` query parameter and endpoint identifier.

The significant changes in `searchOptions.ts` involve the method of specifying the endpoint and improving error handling. A `fieldMap` was introduced to handle a set of dynamic endpoints related to GST data, making the code more maintainable and readable. Before the introduction of `fieldMap`,  the code used a `switch` statement to handle each endpoint separately, which was less efficient and more prone to errors. The final version uses a `fieldMap` to dynamically map endpoints to database fields, and includes improved error handling for invalid endpoints.

The `vesselService.ts` file (modified at 5:42:16 PM) shows the creation of a `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class. This class constructs complex SQL queries for retrieving and counting vessel data, supporting pagination, sorting, filtering by status, and searching across various fields (serial ID, vessel name, line name, and IGM code). The `getVessel`, `saveVessel`, and `fetchVesselData` functions utilize this query builder for database interactions.  `saveVessel` handles both insertion and updates of vessel data, using transactions to ensure data consistency.

The `optionQuery.ts` file (modified at 5:57:20 PM) contains utility functions for building SQL queries to retrieve options for dropdown menus or autocompletion.  It includes functions for generating queries for ports and GST locations, as well as for retrieving users for mentions.  The added `buildOptionQuery` and `buildQueryOptions` functions add flexibility and reusable components for constructing these queries with options for limiting and ordering results.


## 7:40:19 PM
The log shows changes made to two files on September 9, 2025.

The file `customer-columns.tsx` was updated at 6:41:29 PM.  This file defines column configurations for a table, likely for displaying customer data.  Four distinct arrays (`GstDetailsColumn`, `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn`, `AlertMappingColumn`, `facDetailsColumn`) are exported, each specifying columns with properties like `key`, `headerName`, `width`, `type` (e.g., 'text', 'select', 'date'), and alignment.  The columns cover a range of customer details including GST information, key personnel, alerts, and facility details.

The file `DynamicEditableTable.tsx` was updated twice, at 6:43:09 PM and 6:43:34 PM. These updates seem to be minor. The component is a React component that renders an editable table. The updates likely involved minor UI tweaks or bug fixes as the code remains largely the same. The second update appears to be a near-identical copy of the first, with only negligible whitespace differences.  The component allows for adding new rows, deleting rows, and handling changes to cell values. It supports various input types ('text', 'select', 'date', 'checkbox', 'autosearch').


## 9:14:40 PM
The log shows development activity on a backend application, focusing on customer data management and document uploads.

**`optionQuery.ts` (9/9/2025, 6:44:31 PM):** This file defines functions for building SQL queries to retrieve option data (labels and values) from various tables.  It introduces `OptionQuery` class with methods for retrieving port details, GST location information, and mentionable users. The queries use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive searches and limit results.

**`customer.ts` (9/9/2025, 7:24:04 PM & 9/9/2025, 7:38:30 PM):** This file defines TypeScript interfaces for various customer-related data structures.  Significant changes include the addition of `uploadDocuments` array within the `CustomerGstLocation` interface, which now allows embedding upload documents directly within GST location data. The earlier version of this file lacked this array.

**`uploadDocuments.ts` (9/9/2025, 7:34:26 PM):**  This file contains functions for handling document uploads, fetching documents by reference, deleting documents, and downloading documents.  It uses `fs` and `path` modules for file system operations and integrates with a database for persistence.  The `uploadDocument` function has a commented section suggesting the inclusion of user ID.  The `fetchUploadedDocuments` function constructs download links using environment variables (not shown).


**`customerService.ts` (9/9/2025, 7:34:34 PM & 9/9/2025, 7:38:11 PM):** This file provides service functions for interacting with customer data.  The `getCustomer` function retrieves customers based on various search criteria. The most notable change between the two timestamps is the addition of handling the `uploadDocuments` array within the `SaveGstLocation` function in the second revision. This allows for associating documents with customer GST location data during creation. The function uses transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.


**`Paths.ts` (9/9/2025, 7:39:40 PM & 9/9/2025, 7:39:52 PM):** This file defines API endpoint paths. There are no significant changes between the two timestamps – the file content is identical.

**`index.ts` (9/9/2025, 7:40:44 PM, 9/9/2025, 7:41:03 PM & 9/9/2025, 7:41:51 PM):** This file sets up API routes.  The key change is switching the HTTP method for the upload document endpoint from GET to POST between 7:40:44PM and 7:41:03 PM. The file content was identical after 7:41:03 PM and 7:41:51 PM.


In summary, the changes reflect the implementation of a feature allowing document uploads to be associated with customer GST location data.  This involved updating several files:  the data models (`customer.ts`), the API routes (`index.ts`), the service functions that handle database interactions (`customerService.ts`), and the service function for handling document uploads (`uploadDocuments.ts`). The changes occurred within a short time window on September 9th, 2025.

The log shows two revisions of `uploadDocuments.ts`.  Both versions contain functions for uploading, fetching, deleting, and downloading documents.  The key difference between the two versions lies within the `uploadDocument` function.

**Version 1 (9/9/2025, 9:32:51 PM):** This version includes commented-out validation checks for `ref_type`, `ref_id`, and `document_type`, as well as a check for the presence of `req.file`.  The `uploaded_by` field in the payload is set to "system".

**Version 2 (9/9/2025, 9:36:24 PM):** The only significant change in this version is the addition of `console.log("User info:", req.file);` inside the `uploadDocument` function. This suggests a debugging step to examine the file information received in the request. The commented-out validation checks remain unchanged.

Both versions consistently use:

*   `query` and `insertQuery` functions for database interactions.
*   `logger` for logging errors and information.
*   `HttpError` for handling HTTP errors.
*   Similar error handling patterns across all functions.

The file consistently manages document uploads and downloads, utilizing environment variables (`process.env.BACKEND_BASE_URL`, `process.env.DOC_UPLOAD_PATH`) for paths and URLs.  There's consistent use of a `document_upload` database table.  The overall structure and functionality remain the same; only minor debugging additions were made in the second version.
