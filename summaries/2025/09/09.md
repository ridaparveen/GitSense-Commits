# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:39:58 AM
The log shows three revisions of `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`, all within a short time frame (9/9/2025, between 10:32:13 AM and 10:32:30 AM).  The changes primarily involve removing commented-out code related to `formik`. The initial version uses `formik` for form handling, while the final version removes this, opting for a simpler state management approach using `useState` and directly interacting with Redux store using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.  The UI remains largely consistent across all revisions, displaying customer information and a table of GST locations with edit and delete functionalities. The core functionality of adding, editing, deleting, and submitting GST locations persists throughout.  The removal of the `formik` code represents a significant architectural shift in how the form is managed.
