# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:39:58 AM
The log shows three revisions of `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`, all within a short time frame (9/9/2025, between 10:32:13 AM and 10:32:30 AM).  The changes primarily involve removing commented-out code related to `formik`. The initial version uses `formik` for form handling, while the final version removes this, opting for a simpler state management approach using `useState` and directly interacting with Redux store using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.  The UI remains largely consistent across all revisions, displaying customer information and a table of GST locations with edit and delete functionalities. The core functionality of adding, editing, deleting, and submitting GST locations persists throughout.  The removal of the `formik` code represents a significant architectural shift in how the form is managed.


## 11:40:06 AM
The log shows a React component (`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`) undergoing significant revisions between 10:49 AM and 11:39 AM on September 9th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes centers around improving the handling and display of GST location data.

Initially, the component used `useFormik` for form management, but this was later removed, simplifying the code.  A large block of commented-out code related to `formik` is present throughout the file's history.

Early versions struggled with merging GST location data from different sources (state and backend).  This was addressed by introducing a `getValue` helper function (around 11:03 AM) and later, a more concise merge logic using a ternary operator to create `finalGstData` (around 11:09 AM),  prioritizing data from `gstLocations` and falling back to `customerUpdateData`.  The `finalGstData` variable is then used in the `handleSubmit` function to construct the payload.


A key improvement was made at 11:39 AM, altering the `handleSubmit` function. Instead of directly mapping `gstLocations` in the payload, it now uses the `finalGstData` and explicitly names the `gstLocations` key in the payload.


The `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` file is also modified at 11:23 AM.  This component handles individual GST location details. It uses Redux actions (`addGST`, `updateGST`) to manage GST locations in the store. Its changes are primarily related to better navigation and handling of editing existing entries, using the `isEditing` flag and dispatching appropriate Redux actions.  The `serial_id` is used as a unique identifier when adding and updating GST locations.  The component also makes use of an autocomplete component and an interface for  `CustomerRawData`

The `customerDetailsSlice.ts` file (modified at 11:12 AM) introduces Redux reducers for managing lists of customer details, including GST registration details. The reducers allow adding, updating, and removing items from these lists, supporting the functionality of `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` and `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`.  These reducers provide a centralized way to manage customer data within the application's Redux store.
