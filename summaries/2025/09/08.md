# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 11:35:59 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to booking filtering and searching within a T360 application.

`BookingFilters.jsx` underwent two revisions between 11:29:10 AM and 11:29:22 AM on September 8th, 2025.  The only change was a minor code formatting correction; the removal of extra characters "kk" before the filterConfig map function.  This component uses Redux to manage booking dashboard filters.  It renders filter options for Booking Status (radio buttons), Shipper, Consignee, POL, and POD (all checkboxes).  The number of items in each category is dynamically displayed.


`BookingSearchForm.jsx` was modified three times between 11:29:50 AM and 11:32:43 AM on September 8th, 2025. The primary change in the later revisions involved updating the Redux action used for updating search inputs from `updateBookingDashboardInput` within  `../../../store/freatures/cngBookingSlice` to `../../../store/freatures/bookingDashboardSlice`. This component uses Formik for form management, allowing users to search by Agent Booking # and Shipment No.  Commented-out code suggests that MBL and HBL fields were previously included but removed.  A reset functionality is also implemented.

`CngBookingSearchForm.jsx`  was updated twice between 11:33:55 AM and 11:35:07 AM on September 8th, 2025. Similar to `BookingSearchForm.jsx`, the most notable change was also updating the Redux action `updateBookingDashboardInput` to the correct slice `../../../store/freatures/bookingDashboardSlice`.  This component has the same functionality as `BookingSearchForm.jsx`, suggesting potential redundancy or refactoring opportunity. The code structure and functionality of both search forms are nearly identical.


## 12:34:56 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `isf.controller.ts` and `external.routes.ts` files between 12:02 PM and 12:33 PM on September 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `/isf` API endpoint.

Initially,  `isf.controller.ts` contained a rudimentary `getAllIsf` function. This was replaced by a significantly more complex `getAll` function.  This function retrieves data from multiple tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_routing`, `cng_xml_batchlog`, `isf_response`, `isf_commodity_list`) using elaborate SQL queries,  incorporating pagination, sorting, filtering by various criteria (date ranges, booking numbers, statuses, etc.), and user role-based access control. The response is enriched with additional data from joined tables and includes pagination metadata. Error handling and API usage logging are also included.


The `external.routes.ts` file shows the addition of the `/isf` route, initially linked to the simple `getAllIsf` controller.  The route's controller was repeatedly updated to reflect the evolving `isf.controller.ts` modifications.  There were several temporary changes in how `getAll` was called. Finally, it settled on using `isf.getAll`.

The most significant changes occurred between 12:23 PM and 12:31 PM, involving the complete rewrite of the `getAll` function in `isf.controller.ts` to include advanced querying, filtering, and role-based access control.  The final version of `getAll` uses a more sophisticated approach to user-based filtering than earlier attempts.  Initially attempts used  `req.user` object, but this was eventually simplified to only using `req.companyname`.  A notable aspect of the final version is the removal of commented-out code related to `userWhere`, suggesting simplification or refactoring.  The  `external.routes.ts` file was updated concurrently to match the changes in the controller.  The final version removed the intermediate attempts to call `getAllIsfDashboard` and reverted back to `isf.getAll`.
