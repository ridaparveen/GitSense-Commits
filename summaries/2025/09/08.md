# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 11:35:59 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to booking filtering and searching within a T360 application.

`BookingFilters.jsx` underwent two revisions between 11:29:10 AM and 11:29:22 AM on September 8th, 2025.  The only change was a minor code formatting correction; the removal of extra characters "kk" before the filterConfig map function.  This component uses Redux to manage booking dashboard filters.  It renders filter options for Booking Status (radio buttons), Shipper, Consignee, POL, and POD (all checkboxes).  The number of items in each category is dynamically displayed.


`BookingSearchForm.jsx` was modified three times between 11:29:50 AM and 11:32:43 AM on September 8th, 2025. The primary change in the later revisions involved updating the Redux action used for updating search inputs from `updateBookingDashboardInput` within  `../../../store/freatures/cngBookingSlice` to `../../../store/freatures/bookingDashboardSlice`. This component uses Formik for form management, allowing users to search by Agent Booking # and Shipment No.  Commented-out code suggests that MBL and HBL fields were previously included but removed.  A reset functionality is also implemented.

`CngBookingSearchForm.jsx`  was updated twice between 11:33:55 AM and 11:35:07 AM on September 8th, 2025. Similar to `BookingSearchForm.jsx`, the most notable change was also updating the Redux action `updateBookingDashboardInput` to the correct slice `../../../store/freatures/bookingDashboardSlice`.  This component has the same functionality as `BookingSearchForm.jsx`, suggesting potential redundancy or refactoring opportunity. The code structure and functionality of both search forms are nearly identical.


## 12:34:56 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `isf.controller.ts` and `external.routes.ts` files between 12:02 PM and 12:33 PM on September 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `/isf` API endpoint.

Initially,  `isf.controller.ts` contained a rudimentary `getAllIsf` function. This was replaced by a significantly more complex `getAll` function.  This function retrieves data from multiple tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_routing`, `cng_xml_batchlog`, `isf_response`, `isf_commodity_list`) using elaborate SQL queries,  incorporating pagination, sorting, filtering by various criteria (date ranges, booking numbers, statuses, etc.), and user role-based access control. The response is enriched with additional data from joined tables and includes pagination metadata. Error handling and API usage logging are also included.


The `external.routes.ts` file shows the addition of the `/isf` route, initially linked to the simple `getAllIsf` controller.  The route's controller was repeatedly updated to reflect the evolving `isf.controller.ts` modifications.  There were several temporary changes in how `getAll` was called. Finally, it settled on using `isf.getAll`.

The most significant changes occurred between 12:23 PM and 12:31 PM, involving the complete rewrite of the `getAll` function in `isf.controller.ts` to include advanced querying, filtering, and role-based access control.  The final version of `getAll` uses a more sophisticated approach to user-based filtering than earlier attempts.  Initially attempts used  `req.user` object, but this was eventually simplified to only using `req.companyname`.  A notable aspect of the final version is the removal of commented-out code related to `userWhere`, suggesting simplification or refactoring.  The  `external.routes.ts` file was updated concurrently to match the changes in the controller.  The final version removed the intermediate attempts to call `getAllIsfDashboard` and reverted back to `isf.getAll`.


## 12:35:25 PM
The log shows modifications to the `otm_bol.route.ts` file within the `t360-backend` project on September 8th, 2025 at 11:52:22 AM.  The file defines Express.js routes for handling requests related to Bill of Lading (BOL) data.  The update involves various HTTP methods (GET and POST) mapped to different controller functions within `otm_bol.controller`.  Specifically, routes are defined for exporting Excel data (`/excel_data`), fetching data by BOL number (`/:bol`, `/fetch_payload`), getting data by a common key (`/fetch/:common_key`), retrieving PLPO data by BOL (`/`), editing BOL data (`/`), and uploading/saving edited BOL data (`/upload_save_edit`). A commented-out section suggests a previous implementation for uploading Excel files using middleware, which has potentially been refactored or replaced.  The key change appears to be the addition or modification of the `/upload_save_edit` route, indicating an enhancement to the upload and editing functionality.


## 12:35:57 PM
The log shows a single code update to `BookingSearchForm.jsx` on September 8th, 2025, at 11:39:09 AM.  This component, which appears to be a React form for searching bookings, was modified.  The changes involve removing some input fields (`MBL#` and `HBL#`) that were commented out in the code. The form now only allows searching by `Agent Booking#` and `Shipment No`.  The form utilizes `formik` for form handling and `react-redux` for state management, updating the `bookingDashboard` slice with input values.  A reset functionality is also implemented.  The core functionality of submitting search parameters remains, though the number of searchable fields has been reduced.


## 1:45:13 PM
The log shows a single code change on September 8th, 2025, at 12:37:46 PM, affecting `CngBookingFilters.jsx` within a React application.  This component renders booking filters, utilizing React-Redux for state management.  The component dynamically generates filter groups (Booking Status, Shipper, POL, POD) based on `filterInfo` props.  `CngBookingStatusEnum` enum defines booking statuses.  A `toggleBookingDashboardFilter` action updates Redux state. The `FilterChipGroup` component is reused for each filter category, with radio buttons for status and checkboxes for Shipper, POL, and POD.  The `CngBookingSearchForm` component is also included.  The code is well-structured and leverages functional components and hooks.


## 1:45:15 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-thirdparty\src\controller\external\v1\isf.controller.ts` underwent several revisions on September 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a function `getAll` retrieves and returns ISF data based on various query parameters.  The key changes revolve around how the database query is constructed to filter results.

**Initial Version (12:47:05 PM):** The `getAll` function used the `req.companyname` variable directly in the SQL `WHERE` clause for filtering by company. This was potentially vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Subsequent Revisions (12:50:01 PM and 12:50:50 PM):**  The crucial improvement across these two commits was replacing the direct use of `req.companyname` with a parameterized query using `customerWhere = customer = '${req.companyname}'`. This significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection.  Additionally, the `selectedColumns` constant was modified in the last revision to include the `isf.customer` column in the SELECT statement.


The changes consistently focused on refining the database query's `WHERE` clause, enhancing security and accuracy.  The structure of the query, including joins with `cng_xml_batchlog` and `isf_response`, remained unchanged.  The use of `Promise.all` for concurrent query execution also remained constant. The overall pattern involved building dynamic SQL queries based on request parameters and handling errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes.


## 2:49:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `isf.controller.ts` file and the `isf.types.ts` file between 1:46 PM and 2:36 PM on September 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the API endpoint's query parameters and filtering logic.

**`isf.controller.ts` Changes:**

* **Initial version (1:46:01 PM and 1:46:18 PM):**  This version fetches ISF data based on various parameters like `fromDate`, `toDate`, `batch_created_by`, etc., performing multiple database queries.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to constructing complex SQL queries with joins and filters.  There was a minor change between these two timestamps, likely a bug fix in the options object build.


* **Subsequent revisions (1:46:40 PM - 2:36:20 PM):**  These revisions progressively simplify and refine the query parameters.  The most notable change is the shift from using `fromDate` and `toDate` to `etd_from` and `etd_to` for date filtering, filtering against the `etd` (estimated time of departure) field instead of `lastmodifieddate`. The `allowedSearchColumns` array is also modified, and the HTS number search remains. The filtering logic for multi-select fields like `isf_status` is significantly improved by using a switch statement, handling the `ALL` status correctly.  The `options` object in the response is removed in the final versions.  The `isf_ref` query parameter is introduced to allow searching by `agent_booking_id`.  There's also a change in how the date range filter is applied to the `etd` field, initially directly on `isf.bookingdate` and later using a subquery selecting `etd` from `agent_booking_routing`.  Finally, the query for options is removed in the final revisions.


**`isf.types.ts` Changes:**

* **Initial version (2:02:14 PM):** Defines an `ISFStatus` enum with statuses like `NEW`, `DRAFT`, `CANCELLED`, etc., and a `BookingQueryType` interface.


* **Subsequent revisions (2:03:46 PM and 2:07:51 PM):**  The `ISFStatus` enum is updated to reflect different stages of ISF processing (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`, and `ALL`). The `ALL` status is added in the later revision.


* **Final revision (2:12:24 PM):** The interface is renamed to `ISFQueryType` and only includes parameters relevant to the updated filtering logic in `isf.controller.ts`.


**Overall Pattern:**

The changes demonstrate an iterative refinement process.  The initial version was likely functional but overly complex. Subsequent commits focused on simplifying the code, improving efficiency, and making the API more user-friendly by streamlining the query parameters and improving the filtering logic for date ranges and ISF statuses.  The removal of the `options` object suggests a change in the desired API response. The consistent use of parameterized queries is a positive aspect, enhancing security.


## 5:49:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `isf.controller.ts` file between 3:37 PM and 5:48 PM on September 8, 2025, and one revision to `invoice.controller.ts` at 4:24 PM on the same day.  The changes primarily focus on refining a database query within the `getAll` function.

**isf.controller.ts:**

The `getAll` function retrieves data from the `agent_booking_entry` table and performs multiple joins with other tables (`cng_xml_batchlog`, `isf_response`, `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_vessel`).  The initial version (3:37 PM) included all columns in the select statement. Subsequent revisions (4:13 PM, 4:13:50 PM, 4:22 PM, 4:22:19 PM) focused on renaming some selected columns for better clarity (`agent_booking_id` to `isf_ref_id`, `bookingno` to `line_booking_id`).  At 4:23:29 PM, a logging statement was added to display the customer name.  The 4:31:42 PM and 4:36:05 PM revisions adjusted the allowed search columns and removed the `CREATED` status from the status filter. Further refinements at 4:44:01 PM and 4:44:06 PM simplified the `Promise.all` call, removing the `...optionResults` spread and  adding `voyage` and `isf_shipment_type`, `filing_type`, `country_of_origin` to selected columns.  The final revisions (5:35:58 PM, 5:36:54 PM, 5:39:06 PM, 5:41:16 PM, 5:48:49 PM) involved adding a join with the `agent_booking_vessel` table to include vessel information, adjusting the `ref_no` column source and finally modifying the `etd` subquery to include `eta`. A key recurring element is the iterative refinement of the database query, specifically the `selectedColumns` and the handling of  `etd` selection in the subquery. The `ORDER BY` clause remains consistently set to order by `lastmodifieddate` in descending order.


**invoice.controller.ts:**

This file's single revision (4:24:26 PM and 4:24:33 PM) introduces a function to retrieve invoice data.  The query dynamically selects tables (`cng_invoice`/`spr_invoice`, `cng_invoice_details`/`spr_invoice_details`) based on the customer name (`CENTRAL NATIONAL GOTTESMAN, INC.` or `SP RICHARDS COMPANY`). The query also uses `jsonb_agg` to aggregate invoice details. A similar logging statement for customer name was also added.  The key difference here is the dynamic table selection based on customer, demonstrating a different approach compared to the `isf.controller.ts` file's fixed table structure.

In summary, the log reflects a focused development effort on enhancing data retrieval functionalities with a pattern of iterative refinement on database queries to improve efficiency and data selection in both controllers.  The `isf.controller.ts` saw the most extensive changes, primarily focusing on its database query and the addition of vessel information.
