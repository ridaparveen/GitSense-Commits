# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 11:35:59 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to booking filtering and searching within a T360 application.

`BookingFilters.jsx` underwent two revisions between 11:29:10 AM and 11:29:22 AM on September 8th, 2025.  The only change was a minor code formatting correction; the removal of extra characters "kk" before the filterConfig map function.  This component uses Redux to manage booking dashboard filters.  It renders filter options for Booking Status (radio buttons), Shipper, Consignee, POL, and POD (all checkboxes).  The number of items in each category is dynamically displayed.


`BookingSearchForm.jsx` was modified three times between 11:29:50 AM and 11:32:43 AM on September 8th, 2025. The primary change in the later revisions involved updating the Redux action used for updating search inputs from `updateBookingDashboardInput` within  `../../../store/freatures/cngBookingSlice` to `../../../store/freatures/bookingDashboardSlice`. This component uses Formik for form management, allowing users to search by Agent Booking # and Shipment No.  Commented-out code suggests that MBL and HBL fields were previously included but removed.  A reset functionality is also implemented.

`CngBookingSearchForm.jsx`  was updated twice between 11:33:55 AM and 11:35:07 AM on September 8th, 2025. Similar to `BookingSearchForm.jsx`, the most notable change was also updating the Redux action `updateBookingDashboardInput` to the correct slice `../../../store/freatures/bookingDashboardSlice`.  This component has the same functionality as `BookingSearchForm.jsx`, suggesting potential redundancy or refactoring opportunity. The code structure and functionality of both search forms are nearly identical.
