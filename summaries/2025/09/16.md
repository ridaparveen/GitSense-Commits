# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 10:38:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `optionService.ts` between 7:53 PM and 7:55 PM on September 15, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the `normalizeOption` function.  The initial version contained a more verbose `else if` block for "port-data" handling. Subsequent changes simplified this logic using the conditional operator (`||`) to concisely determine the `value` based on available data fields (pol, pol_code, pod, pod_code, line_name). A final revision corrected the value to be always `item.line_name` in the `port-data` conditional.

A significant change occurred in `LineBookingDashboard.tsx` at 8:00 PM on September 15, 2025. This component was updated to fetch and display line booking data, incorporating search, sorting, filtering, and excel export functionality.  The filtering options are dynamically generated based on unique values from the fetched data (POD and Line Name).  A debounce function is used to optimize search performance.  The component also manages modal popups for confirming, cancelling, and viewing line booking details.

On September 16, 2025, `LineBookingForm.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:30 AM and 10:35 AM.  These modifications centered around improving the handling of form submission, particularly for "add" and "edit" actions. The component uses `formik` for form management, Redux for state management, and makes API calls via `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`.  The primary changes revolved around refining how data is passed between components and adjusting the routing logic.  Specifically, the state object passed during navigation was altered to consistently include `vessel_voyage_id`. A final revision removed  unnecessary `vessel_voyage_id` parameter from the state object that is sent to `/app/export/line_booking/add_line_booking` route.


Finally, `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` was updated at 10:36 AM on September 16, 2025. This component, responsible for adding or editing line booking details, utilizes `formik` and a `DynamicEditableTable` for managing form data and equipment details.  It leverages the `AutocompleteSearch` component for user input and employs Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) to manage state changes. The routing logic is also implemented, ensuring proper navigation after form submission.


## 12:38:52 PM
The `customerBookingService.ts` file underwent updates on September 16th, 2025, at 12:06:34 PM.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the customer booking management functionalities.

Several key functions were modified or added:

* **`getNewBookingId`**: This function generates a new booking ID and returns it as a JSON response.  Error handling is included.

* **`getAll`**: This function retrieves all customer bookings based on various filter criteria (page, perPage, line_booking_no, customer_booking_no, status, dates, pol, pod, line_name, orderBy),  constructing a complex query using a `QueryBuilder`. It fetches associated equipment details and handles pagination.  It includes extensive logging using `logger.info` and robust error handling with detailed logging.

* **`newCustomerBooking`**: This function assigns a line booking to a customer, updating the `line_booking_master` table. Input validation is performed to ensure correct data types (`boolean` for `custom_clearance` and `transportation`).  Error handling and logging are included.

* **`updateCustomerBooking`**: This function updates customer booking container information. It handles file uploads using `req.files`, deletes old container data before inserting new data, and includes transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to maintain data consistency.  Detailed logging is incorporated at each stage (deletion, insertion).

* **`getCustomerBookingById`**: This function retrieves customer booking details by ID, including associated equipment and container information. It handles cases where the number of containers and equipment might differ, ensuring a unified response.  It also constructs image URLs from `document_path`


Recurring patterns include:

* Consistent use of asynchronous functions (`async`/`await`).
* Extensive error handling with logging using `logger` and HTTP status codes from `HttpStatusCodes`.
* Use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Reliance on custom `QueryBuilder` for database interactions.
*  Modular design with functions for specific operations (generating IDs, retrieving data, updating data, etc.).

The code demonstrates a well-structured approach to building a RESTful API for managing customer bookings, with a strong emphasis on data integrity, error handling, and logging.  The use of transactions in `updateCustomerBooking` is particularly noteworthy for ensuring atomicity.


## 12:39:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components, `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`, and a Redux slice, `lineBookingSlice.ts`,  all related to managing line bookings.  The changes span from 11:07 AM to 12:36 PM on September 16, 2025.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` is a form for adding or editing line bookings.  Early revisions focused on form submission handling using `formik` and  Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) to manage the booking list in the Redux store.  Later revisions improved the navigation logic after submission and cancellation, clarifying the distinction between adding a new booking and editing an existing one based on the `formAction` property in the state object.  The  `isEditMode` logic was refined to depend on both the presence of booking data and the value of `formAction`. A `handleCancel` function was added for clearer navigation back to previous screens.  The final revision simplifies the edit/add logic based on the `formAction` state.  The page title now dynamically reflects whether it's an "Add" or "Edit" operation based on `state?.formAction`.

`LineBookingForm.tsx` displays a list of line bookings and provides actions to add, edit, and delete entries.  Changes in this file involved adding functionality to handle adding more line bookings, using  `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` for API interactions, and improved error handling with `react-hot-toast`.  Initially, the logic for determining the vessel name and voyage was inconsistent.  This was corrected by prioritizing the data from `vesselData` over `vesselBooking` to ensure consistency. Edit navigation was updated to pass the necessary state (`vesselData`, `booking`, `formAction`, `fromLineBookingPage`, `vessel_voyage_id`) to `AddLineBookingForm`.   Later revisions enhanced the handling of new versus existing bookings in the `onSubmit` handler by checking  `initialValues?.vessel_voyage_id` and `vessel_voyage_id` and improved success/error toast messages. The edit function was simplified to always set formAction as "edit", and the number of columns was updated to correctly reflect the table structure.


`lineBookingSlice.ts` is a Redux slice responsible for managing the state of line bookings. Revisions focused on improving serial ID generation and handling during `addList`, `updateList` and `removeList` operations to be more robust and prevent issues with serial ID assignments.   Specifically, serial IDs are now generated dynamically in `addList` based on the existing bookings.  `updateList` now includes logging for debugging purposes. The `removeList` operation now only updates serial IDs when necessary ensuring correct serial_id assignment after deletion.


Overall, the changes reflect a continuous effort to refine the user interface and backend data management for line booking functionality, primarily focused on improving the clarity of logic, error handling, and data consistency.  A recurring pattern involves using the `formAction` property and `fromLineBookingPage` boolean in the state object to control component behavior and navigation.


## 3:00:41 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files related to a line booking system's frontend.  The most significant changes are concentrated between 12:42 PM and 1:14 PM on September 16, 2025.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`: This component was updated to use the `lineBooking` endpoint key in the AutocompleteSearch component for the "Line Name" field. This suggests a change in how line names are fetched or managed.  The initial values for the form were also refined, including handling of equipment data.

`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This component handles the display and management of existing line bookings.  Updates include using Redux for data management (using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`), API calls for saving and updating line bookings (`useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`), and improved error handling with `react-hot-toast`.

`LineBookingDashboard.tsx`: This component, displaying a dashboard of line bookings, underwent several revisions.  The primary changes involve enhancing the filtering and sorting capabilities.  The filtering options were updated to include "New" and to remove "In Progress" status options, and the  `useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery` hook was used to fetch data from the backend. Multiple updates were made to this file throughout the log, indicating iterative improvements.  The addition of the styled tooltip component in the  `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` function in a later version of this file is notable.

`LineBooking_SORT_OPTIONS.ts`: This file, defining sorting options, experienced several edits. Initially, there were typos ("line -desc", "vessel_-desc", "voyoge-asc", "voyoge-desc"). These were corrected to "line_name*desc", "vessel_name*desc" and the "voyage" label was fixed in subsequent commits.  Finally, "voyoge" was removed, possibly due to redundancy or a change in the data model.

`optionService.ts`: This service handles fetching and normalizing options for autocomplete.  The `normalizeOption` function was significantly modified to handle different endpoint keys (`customer-name`, `vessel-voyage`, `port-data`, and a generic else clause). Static options were added for "pol" and "lineBooking" endpoints.

`vesselVoyagePopup.tsx`:  This component experienced numerous iterations focused on improving form validation and handling of the `AutocompleteSearch` component. The initial version did not reliably trigger validation after selecting a vessel voyage. Subsequent commits improved this by explicitly setting `formik.setFieldTouched` to `true` and calling `formik.validateField`.  The final version simplifies the handling of form updates, using `handleOptionSelect` for consistency.

`AutocompleteSearch.tsx`: The `AutocompleteSearch` component was initially missing proper error handling which caused validation issues.  The final version corrects this by directly using `errorText` and `hasError` variables to display errors correctly.  The `touched` prop was removed as the error handling is directly linked to the `errors` object.

`data/coulms/line-booking-columns.tsx`: This file defines columns for data grids.  Significant changes involved improving the display of line booking status using MUI's `Tooltip` and `styled` components,  enhancing readability and user experience.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development focused on improving the user interface and functionality of the line booking system.  The updates show a transition to a more robust and centralized data management system, utilizing Redux and API calls for better application state and external data handling. The changes to the `AutocompleteSearch` component were crucial in fixing validation issues.  The `optionService` file has been improved by reducing the need for fallback data by correctly fetching data from the API for specific endpoints.


## 4:00:39 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to components and pages related to line booking functionality within a React application.  The changes span from 3:01 PM to 3:58 PM on September 16, 2025.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`: This component underwent numerous revisions.  Initial versions focused on creating a form using `formik` for adding and editing line bookings.  It utilized various UI components like `InputBox`, `AutocompleteSearch`, `DynamicEditableTable`, and Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) for data management.  Later changes centered around refining the `onSubmit` handler to properly handle both add and edit scenarios, specifically addressing how to update existing records. The `booking_date` field was updated to use the `appDateFormat` utility for formatting.  A significant change at 3:21 PM and subsequent modifications corrected the navigation logic after submission, ensuring proper state preservation ("edit" vs "add") in the navigation parameters.  Finally, the page title was corrected to dynamically reflect whether it is "Add" or "Edit" based on `isEditMode`.

`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx`: This page displays line booking details and provides access to a form for adding or editing them.  Changes at 3:03 PM and 3:03 PM  involved correcting a typo in `appDateFormat` usage; initially, the `line_name` was incorrectly processed. The component primarily fetches data using `useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery` and renders a `LineBookingForm` component.

`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This component, responsible for handling the actual form, received major updates at 3:04 PM and 3:04 PM.  The most significant changes were the integration of Redux state management (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for managing a list of line bookings.  It includes API interactions (`useSaveLineBookingMutation`, `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`) for saving and updating data, utilizing the `appDateFormat` utility for date formatting.  Error handling with `react-hot-toast` was added to provide feedback to the user, along with a loading spinner.  The `handleAddMore` function was added to navigate to `AddLineBookingForm`. A final update at 3:58 PM mainly focused on renaming a console log statement for debugging purposes.


Recurring patterns include consistent use of  `formik` for form handling,  Redux for state management,  `react-router-dom` for navigation,  and custom UI components from the `@components` directory. The repeated use of `appDateFormat` suggests a common need for date formatting across the application. The frequent updates to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` indicate that this component was the primary focus of development and debugging efforts, especially around correctly managing the "add" and "edit" modes and their corresponding navigation after form submission.


## 5:00:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `linebookingService.ts` file between 4:37 PM and 4:55 PM on September 16, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `create` function, which handles the creation of line bookings.

Initially, the `create` function included a check for duplicate bookings based on `vessel_voyage_id` and `line_booking_no`.  Later revisions simplified this duplicate check by only considering the `line_booking_no`, improving efficiency.  Furthermore, error handling was enhanced to explicitly handle database constraint violations (specifically duplicate key errors) by returning a more informative HTTP 409 Conflict response instead of a generic 500 Internal Server Error.  This is evident in changes between timestamps 4:46 PM and 4:55 PM.

Another significant change involved the `confirmLineBooking` function added between 4:39 PM and 4:46 PM.  This function adds a `do_number` to existing line bookings, updates their status to `CONFIRMED`, and uses the `saveDoc` function to store associated files.  Logging statements were also added to this function for debugging purposes.

Throughout the revisions, the file consistently uses  `query` and `insertQuery` functions for database interactions, utilizing parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code also makes use of `moment.js` for date manipulation and a custom `QueryBuilder` class for constructing database queries.  The structure of the database interactions, utilizing transactions (`BEGIN` and `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`), remains consistent throughout the updates.  The `create` function shows consistent insertion to both `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables.


## 5:00:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and one revision of `LineBookingForm.tsx` and `ValidationSchema.ts` between 4:01 PM and 5:00 PM on September 16, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is on the `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` component.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`:  The component is a form for adding or editing line bookings.  Several revisions focused on improving the handling of form submission and data management, particularly concerning the `equipments` array.

* **Initial Version (4:01 PM):** The initial version of the form included basic input fields, an editable table for equipment details, and form submission using `formik`.  The `onSubmit` handler dispatched either `addList` or `updateList` Redux actions based on whether it was an add or edit operation.  Serial IDs for new bookings were generated using `Date.now()`.

* **Subsequent Revisions (4:06 PM, 4:08 PM, 4:10 PM, 4:11 PM, 4:12 PM):**  These revisions primarily addressed the generation of `serial_id` and the handling of edit mode.  Initially, a timestamp was used for new entries. The `serial_id` generation logic was refined to prioritize using the existing `serial_id` if available in edit mode, falling back to a timestamp only if a `serial_id` wasn't present.  The navigation after submission was adjusted to pass the `bookingData` back to the main Line Booking screen.  The conditional logic for updating versus adding was also improved for better clarity and error handling in edit mode where a new row might be added.

* **Final Version (5:00 PM):** A validation schema (`validationSchema.ts`) was integrated into the `formik` configuration.  The `appDateFormat` function was removed from the `onSubmit` handler (meaning booking dates are now submitted in the format from the date input), and the `endpointKey` for the POL and POD autocomplete was changed to "port-data".  Error handling for the `equipments` array was added to the UI.


`LineBookingForm.tsx` (4:49 PM): This component displays a list of line bookings and provides actions to add, edit, and delete them. It uses Redux to manage the list of line bookings and interacts with a backend API (`useSaveLineBookingMutation`, `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`).  The component's update involved primarily improving the handling of Redux actions for managing line bookings.  It also introduces better error handling via `react-hot-toast`.

`ValidationSchema.ts` (4:58 PM): This file defines a Yup schema for validating the line booking form data.  The schema currently only validates the `equipments` array, ensuring at least one equipment is added and that the size, type, and count fields are correctly populated.


The overall pattern in the changes reflects a progressive refinement of the form's functionality and error handling, along with an improvement in Redux integration and API interaction (in `LineBookingForm.tsx`).  The changes were iterative, with each revision addressing specific aspects of the form's behavior and data handling.


## 7:00:34 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`,  along with supporting type definitions in `line-booking.types.ts` and column definitions in `line-booking-columns.tsx`.  The changes span from 5:01 PM to 6:48 PM on September 16, 2025.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`: This component is a form for adding or editing individual line bookings.  The most significant changes involve the `onSubmit` handler.  Early revisions  simply dispatched `addList` or `updateList` actions to the Redux store.  Later revisions introduce a check to determine if an edit is updating an existing booking or creating a new one, based on whether the `serial_id` already exists in the Redux store.  This ensures that only one dispatch action is called, avoiding potential issues. The error message for `formik.errors.equipments` was also refined from a JSON representation of the equipment values to a more user-friendly message  ("At least one equipment should be added").  A `handleGoBack` function was added for better navigation consistency. The `originalFormAction` is consistently used for back navigation to maintain the original add/edit context.


`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This component is a main form displaying a list of line bookings.  It uses a table to render the bookings, providing actions to edit or delete.  The key update was in the `onSubmit` handler.  The `line_bookings` array in the submission payload is modified to explicitly handle `serial_id` type conversion from number to string to better align with backend expectations.  This was a crucial fix in the later revisions to ensure successful API interactions.

`line-booking.types.ts`: This file defines TypeScript interfaces for various data structures related to line bookings, including `LineBookingData`, `LineBooking`, `BookingPayload`, `LineBookingState`, and `FilterType`. A `voyage` property was added to `LineBookingData` in one of the later updates.


`line-booking-columns.tsx`: This file defines columns for data grids, including `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` and `TABLE_COLUMN`. A minor change improved the readability of the column header name  "Tempreture" to "Temperature".  The width of the "Equipments" column in `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` was increased.

In summary, the code changes primarily focus on improving the handling of add/edit operations within the Redux store, refining error handling, and correcting type inconsistencies for API interactions to achieve more robust and reliable functionality within the line booking system.  The consistent use of  `originalFormAction` in navigation demonstrates a focus on maintaining state across multiple components.
