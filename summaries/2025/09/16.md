# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 10:38:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `optionService.ts` between 7:53 PM and 7:55 PM on September 15, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the `normalizeOption` function.  The initial version contained a more verbose `else if` block for "port-data" handling. Subsequent changes simplified this logic using the conditional operator (`||`) to concisely determine the `value` based on available data fields (pol, pol_code, pod, pod_code, line_name). A final revision corrected the value to be always `item.line_name` in the `port-data` conditional.

A significant change occurred in `LineBookingDashboard.tsx` at 8:00 PM on September 15, 2025. This component was updated to fetch and display line booking data, incorporating search, sorting, filtering, and excel export functionality.  The filtering options are dynamically generated based on unique values from the fetched data (POD and Line Name).  A debounce function is used to optimize search performance.  The component also manages modal popups for confirming, cancelling, and viewing line booking details.

On September 16, 2025, `LineBookingForm.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:30 AM and 10:35 AM.  These modifications centered around improving the handling of form submission, particularly for "add" and "edit" actions. The component uses `formik` for form management, Redux for state management, and makes API calls via `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`.  The primary changes revolved around refining how data is passed between components and adjusting the routing logic.  Specifically, the state object passed during navigation was altered to consistently include `vessel_voyage_id`. A final revision removed  unnecessary `vessel_voyage_id` parameter from the state object that is sent to `/app/export/line_booking/add_line_booking` route.


Finally, `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` was updated at 10:36 AM on September 16, 2025. This component, responsible for adding or editing line booking details, utilizes `formik` and a `DynamicEditableTable` for managing form data and equipment details.  It leverages the `AutocompleteSearch` component for user input and employs Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) to manage state changes. The routing logic is also implemented, ensuring proper navigation after form submission.


## 12:38:52 PM
The `customerBookingService.ts` file underwent updates on September 16th, 2025, at 12:06:34 PM.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the customer booking management functionalities.

Several key functions were modified or added:

* **`getNewBookingId`**: This function generates a new booking ID and returns it as a JSON response.  Error handling is included.

* **`getAll`**: This function retrieves all customer bookings based on various filter criteria (page, perPage, line_booking_no, customer_booking_no, status, dates, pol, pod, line_name, orderBy),  constructing a complex query using a `QueryBuilder`. It fetches associated equipment details and handles pagination.  It includes extensive logging using `logger.info` and robust error handling with detailed logging.

* **`newCustomerBooking`**: This function assigns a line booking to a customer, updating the `line_booking_master` table. Input validation is performed to ensure correct data types (`boolean` for `custom_clearance` and `transportation`).  Error handling and logging are included.

* **`updateCustomerBooking`**: This function updates customer booking container information. It handles file uploads using `req.files`, deletes old container data before inserting new data, and includes transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to maintain data consistency.  Detailed logging is incorporated at each stage (deletion, insertion).

* **`getCustomerBookingById`**: This function retrieves customer booking details by ID, including associated equipment and container information. It handles cases where the number of containers and equipment might differ, ensuring a unified response.  It also constructs image URLs from `document_path`


Recurring patterns include:

* Consistent use of asynchronous functions (`async`/`await`).
* Extensive error handling with logging using `logger` and HTTP status codes from `HttpStatusCodes`.
* Use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Reliance on custom `QueryBuilder` for database interactions.
*  Modular design with functions for specific operations (generating IDs, retrieving data, updating data, etc.).

The code demonstrates a well-structured approach to building a RESTful API for managing customer bookings, with a strong emphasis on data integrity, error handling, and logging.  The use of transactions in `updateCustomerBooking` is particularly noteworthy for ensuring atomicity.


## 12:39:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components, `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`, and a Redux slice, `lineBookingSlice.ts`,  all related to managing line bookings.  The changes span from 11:07 AM to 12:36 PM on September 16, 2025.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` is a form for adding or editing line bookings.  Early revisions focused on form submission handling using `formik` and  Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) to manage the booking list in the Redux store.  Later revisions improved the navigation logic after submission and cancellation, clarifying the distinction between adding a new booking and editing an existing one based on the `formAction` property in the state object.  The  `isEditMode` logic was refined to depend on both the presence of booking data and the value of `formAction`. A `handleCancel` function was added for clearer navigation back to previous screens.  The final revision simplifies the edit/add logic based on the `formAction` state.  The page title now dynamically reflects whether it's an "Add" or "Edit" operation based on `state?.formAction`.

`LineBookingForm.tsx` displays a list of line bookings and provides actions to add, edit, and delete entries.  Changes in this file involved adding functionality to handle adding more line bookings, using  `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` for API interactions, and improved error handling with `react-hot-toast`.  Initially, the logic for determining the vessel name and voyage was inconsistent.  This was corrected by prioritizing the data from `vesselData` over `vesselBooking` to ensure consistency. Edit navigation was updated to pass the necessary state (`vesselData`, `booking`, `formAction`, `fromLineBookingPage`, `vessel_voyage_id`) to `AddLineBookingForm`.   Later revisions enhanced the handling of new versus existing bookings in the `onSubmit` handler by checking  `initialValues?.vessel_voyage_id` and `vessel_voyage_id` and improved success/error toast messages. The edit function was simplified to always set formAction as "edit", and the number of columns was updated to correctly reflect the table structure.


`lineBookingSlice.ts` is a Redux slice responsible for managing the state of line bookings. Revisions focused on improving serial ID generation and handling during `addList`, `updateList` and `removeList` operations to be more robust and prevent issues with serial ID assignments.   Specifically, serial IDs are now generated dynamically in `addList` based on the existing bookings.  `updateList` now includes logging for debugging purposes. The `removeList` operation now only updates serial IDs when necessary ensuring correct serial_id assignment after deletion.


Overall, the changes reflect a continuous effort to refine the user interface and backend data management for line booking functionality, primarily focused on improving the clarity of logic, error handling, and data consistency.  A recurring pattern involves using the `formAction` property and `fromLineBookingPage` boolean in the state object to control component behavior and navigation.
