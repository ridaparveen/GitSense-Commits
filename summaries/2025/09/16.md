# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 10:38:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `optionService.ts` between 7:53 PM and 7:55 PM on September 15, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the `normalizeOption` function.  The initial version contained a more verbose `else if` block for "port-data" handling. Subsequent changes simplified this logic using the conditional operator (`||`) to concisely determine the `value` based on available data fields (pol, pol_code, pod, pod_code, line_name). A final revision corrected the value to be always `item.line_name` in the `port-data` conditional.

A significant change occurred in `LineBookingDashboard.tsx` at 8:00 PM on September 15, 2025. This component was updated to fetch and display line booking data, incorporating search, sorting, filtering, and excel export functionality.  The filtering options are dynamically generated based on unique values from the fetched data (POD and Line Name).  A debounce function is used to optimize search performance.  The component also manages modal popups for confirming, cancelling, and viewing line booking details.

On September 16, 2025, `LineBookingForm.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:30 AM and 10:35 AM.  These modifications centered around improving the handling of form submission, particularly for "add" and "edit" actions. The component uses `formik` for form management, Redux for state management, and makes API calls via `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`.  The primary changes revolved around refining how data is passed between components and adjusting the routing logic.  Specifically, the state object passed during navigation was altered to consistently include `vessel_voyage_id`. A final revision removed  unnecessary `vessel_voyage_id` parameter from the state object that is sent to `/app/export/line_booking/add_line_booking` route.


Finally, `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` was updated at 10:36 AM on September 16, 2025. This component, responsible for adding or editing line booking details, utilizes `formik` and a `DynamicEditableTable` for managing form data and equipment details.  It leverages the `AutocompleteSearch` component for user input and employs Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) to manage state changes. The routing logic is also implemented, ensuring proper navigation after form submission.
