# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 10:02:00 AM
On September 23, 2025, at 5:14:48 PM, the `vendorServices.ts` file was updated.  This file contains TypeScript code for managing vendor data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting vendors.  The update encompasses three main functions:

* **`getAll`:** This function retrieves a paginated list of vendors. It supports filtering by vendor name and sorting by various fields (defaulting to creation timestamp in descending order).  It uses a `QueryBuilder` class for constructing the database queries and handles pagination and error logging.

* **`addVendor`:** This function adds a new vendor to the database. It performs input validation, ensuring that the `vendor_name` is provided and the `status` is valid. Upon successful insertion, it returns the newly created vendor's data.  Error handling and logging are included.

* **`updateVendor`:** This function updates an existing vendor. It requires a `serial_id` as a parameter and performs input validation for the status field. It returns appropriate status codes depending on whether the vendor was found and successfully updated.  Error handling and logging are included.

All three functions utilize custom database interaction functions (`insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`) from a common utility module, along with custom types and constants defined elsewhere in the project.  The functions consistently log errors using a `logger` object and return standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.  A consistent pattern of comprehensive error handling and logging is observed throughout the code.


## 10:02:05 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `VendorDetailsPage.tsx` and `VendorDetailsForm.tsx` between 5:17 PM and 5:50 PM on September 23, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the vendor data form and its submission functionality.

`VendorDetailsPage.tsx`:

* **Initial versions (5:17 PM):**  The component was initially created, including basic structure using `PageWrapper`, `VendorDetailsForm`, navigation (`useNavigate`), and an initial state for `vendorData`.  The `useSaveVendorMutation` hook was present but not fully utilized.

* **Adding form submission (5:19 PM - 5:25 PM):** A `handleSubmit` function was added to handle form submission using the `AddVendorDetails` mutation.  Error handling with `react-hot-toast` for success and failure scenarios was also implemented. Initially the success message was "Vessel" instead of "Vendor", and this was corrected around 5:29 PM. The navigation after a successful submission was initially to `/app/master/vessel`,  but was corrected to `/app/master/vendor` around 5:30 PM.


* **Status Dropdown (5:48 PM - 5:50 PM):**  A dropdown to select the vendor status ("Active" or "Inactive") was added using `SelectBox`.  The `handleDropdownChange` function updates the `statusValue` state based on the dropdown selection. The unnecessary conditional rendering of toast messages was removed from 5:49 PM onwards.

* **Simplification (5:50 PM):**  Unnecessary components like `ScreenToolbar` and `ThemedBreadcrumb`  were removed, streamlining the code.

`VendorDetailsForm.tsx`:

* **Initial version (5:23 PM):** The form component was created, using `formik` for form management.  It includes input fields, a tabbed interface (`ThemeTabs`) for "GST Registration Details," "Tariff Details," and "Upload Files," and a submit button.

* **Refactoring (5:42 PM - 5:47 PM):** Field names were updated for consistency, specifically renaming `add_line1` and `add_line2` to `address_1` and `address_2` respectively,  and similarly for telephone fields. The `SelectBox` component's `onChange` handler was updated to correctly use `formik.setFieldValue` for both `country` and `city` around 5:46 PM and 5:47 PM, respectively.


`vendor.types.ts`:

* **Updated (5:43 PM):** This file was updated to reflect the changes in field names from `VendorDetailsForm.tsx`. The `VendorFormValues` interface now uses `address_1`, `address_2`, `telephone_1`, `telephone_2` instead of the previous names.


The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, starting with a basic form and gradually adding features like form submission, error handling, and a status selection dropdown. The updates also show a focus on improving consistency in naming conventions and form handling logic using `formik`.  The final versions are significantly more refined than the initial ones.


## 11:02:02 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` and `VendorDetailsPage.tsx`, with one change to `action.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 4 minutes on September 24th, 2025.

`VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` underwent three revisions. The key change was in the `AppGrid` component's `paginationModel` prop.  Initially, the page and pageSize were directly set. The subsequent revisions improved this by using `vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.page` and `vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.perPage` respectively,  ensuring correct data population from the API response.  This change addresses a potential pagination issue in the earlier version.  No other significant functional changes were made across the three revisions.


`VendorDetailsPage.tsx` was updated twice. The first revision was a complete addition. The second revision, at 11:01:35 AM, added pre-population of the `vendor_name` field in the `vendorData` state using data passed from the location state.  This enables editing existing vendor data. The component uses a form for adding or editing vendor details, making API calls with `useSaveVendorMutation` to save changes.  Success and error messages are displayed using `react-hot-toast`.

`action.tsx` shows the addition of a function  `getVendorActions` which returns an array of actions (currently only Edit)  for a vendor data grid.  It uses  `ReactNode` for icons and labels and takes a navigation function and access object as parameters.


## 12:02:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `vendorServices.ts` file and one revision to `vendorRoutes.ts` between 11:19 AM and 11:52 AM on September 24, 2025.  The `vendorServices.ts` file underwent several iterations, primarily focusing on the implementation of vendor management functionalities.

Initially, the `vendorServices.ts` file contained functions for `getAll`, `addVendor`, and `updateVendor`.  These functions utilized a custom `QueryBuilder` for database interactions, handled pagination and sorting, and implemented appropriate HTTP status code responses.  A key change between 11:23 AM and 11:27 AM involved correcting a logical error in the `addVendor` function's status validation.

Between 11:29 AM and 11:30 AM, a new function, `getVendorCardInfo`, was added to `vendorServices.ts`. This function retrieves vendor count information (active, inactive, and total) based on optional date range (`fromDate`, `toDate`) and filtering options ("weekly", "monthly", "all").  The corresponding route was added in `vendorRoutes.ts` at 11:30:55 AM.

Minor changes in `vendorServices.ts` after 11:30 AM  included removal of unnecessary `data` field in the response of `addVendor` function, and at 11:52 AM, the `getVendorCardInfo` function was updated to use uppercase `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` for status comparison in the SQL query to ensure consistency.  Throughout the modifications, error handling using `logger` and appropriate HTTP status codes remained consistent across all functions.  The core functionality of the vendor services remained consistent throughout the revisions, primarily focused on CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with added dashboard functionality.


## 12:02:09 PM
The log shows a series of code changes made to the Envosys frontend between 11:02 AM and 11:59 AM on September 24, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `VendorDetailsPage.tsx` component and the `vendorDataApi.ts` file, focusing on vendor data management.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\vendor\VendorDetailsPage.tsx`:**

This file underwent numerous revisions throughout the log.  Early changes (11:02 AM - 11:03 AM) focused on initial implementation, including setting up state for vendor details using `useState` and handling form submission (`handleSubmit`) using  `useSaveVendorMutation` for creating vendors.  Later changes (11:10 AM onwards) introduced `useUpdateVendorMutation` to handle vendor updates, significantly altering the `handleSubmit` function to conditionally use either `AddVendorDetails` or `UpdateVendorDetails` based on the `formAction` prop.  Further edits refined error handling, success messages using `react-hot-toast`, and corrected the way `serial_id` was accessed and handled within the `handleSubmit` function. The final change (11:22 AM onwards) updated the `options` for the status `SelectBox` to use uppercase values ("ACTIVE", "INACTIVE") reflecting backend changes.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\vendorDataApi.ts`:**

This file, containing the API calls for vendor data, saw modifications primarily around the `updateVendor` mutation.  Initially, the update endpoint was incorrectly defined.  Multiple revisions corrected the endpoint URL to correctly handle the `serial_id` parameter for updating existing records, resulting in `/api/vendor/update/${serial_id}`.  Additional logging was added to aid debugging (11:08 AM and 11:13 AM).  The `getVendorCardVData` endpoint was renamed to `getVendorCardData` at 11:43 AM.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`:**

This file, related to Redux store configuration, shows the addition of `vendorDataApi.middleware` at 11:45 AM, integrating the vendor API calls into the Redux store.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\OverviewContainer.tsx`:**

This component, displaying vendor dashboard overview, was updated (11:45 AM - 11:53 AM) to fetch data using `useGetVendorCardDataQuery` from `vendorDataApi` and correctly display vendor counts. A crucial change was updating the navigation route for adding a new vendor from `/app/master/vessel_voyage/new_vessel_voyage` to the appropriate `/app/master/vendor/new_vendor` route.  Unnecessary imports were also removed in the final version.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\VendorDashboard.tsx`:**

This component, rendering the vendor dashboard, shows a similar pattern: initial implementation (11:45 AM), refined search functionality (removing unnecessary state), and removal of unused state variables, resulting in a cleaner, more efficient component.  The use of `vendorDashboardData` from the API call in `generateExcel` function improved data consistency.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\options\common.ts`:**

This file shows no changes related to vendor data, it only contains other options related to other parts of the application.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\VendorDetailsForm.tsx`:**

This component is the form for vendor creation and update. The changes reflect in the  `VendorDetailsForm`  component, which was added at 11:59 AM, and seems to be the final version reflecting the structure and functionality of the Vendor creation/update form.


In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort on building and refining the vendor management features in the Envosys frontend, particularly improving API interactions, data handling, and user interface elements.  The iterative process of refining the API endpoint for updating vendors and fixing several logic errors in the `VendorDetailsPage` component are particularly noteworthy.


## 3:15:53 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the backend code of an Envosys application, primarily focused on customer management.  The key changes revolve around the `customerService.ts` and `customer.ts` files.

**`customer.ts` (9/24/2025, 2:29:29 PM & 9/24/2025, 2:48:18 PM):**  This file, defining customer data types, underwent two revisions.  The changes primarily involved modifications to the `GetCustomerParams` interface. Initially, parameters like `vessel_name`, `pol`, and `voyage` were present.  The second revision replaced these with `customer_name` and removed the others, suggesting a refactoring of the customer search/retrieval functionality to focus on customer-specific attributes (`customer_name`, `customer_type`, `customer_id`, `location`). The file also defines interfaces for various customer-related details, including GST location, key personal details, alert mappings, credit control, and facility (FAC) details. These suggest a comprehensive customer data model.

**`customerService.ts` (9/24/2025, 2:25:34 PM, 9/24/2025, 2:34:42 PM, 9/24/2025, 2:36:52 PM & 9/24/2025, 2:48:11 PM):** This file contains the core customer service logic.  It saw multiple revisions throughout the afternoon of September 24th, 2025.  The changes reflect iterative improvements and additions to the functionality.

* **Initial version (2:25:34 PM):**  Focused on basic customer retrieval (`getCustomer`), dashboard card information (`getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`), customer details saving (`saveCustomerDetails`), and GST location saving (`SaveGstLocation`).  This version used direct SQL queries.

* **Subsequent versions (2:34:42 PM, 2:36:52 PM, 2:48:11 PM):** Introduced a `QueryBuilder` class to improve query construction and maintainability.  The `getAll` function was added, implementing pagination and sorting capabilities using the `QueryBuilder`.  The `getAll` function's query parameters were adjusted to align with the changes made in `customer.ts`. Specifically, the `name` parameter was renamed to `customer_name` for clarity. The `getAll` function was also updated to include options query for dropdowns.  These later versions indicate a shift towards better structured, more robust data access, with improved error handling via the `logger` and a clearer separation of concerns.  Moment.js was also added for date formatting.

**`masterRoutes.ts` (9/24/2025, 2:35:17 PM):** This file defines the API routes for the customer management endpoints, demonstrating how the `customerService` functions are exposed as API endpoints. The routes include endpoints for retrieving customer dashboard information, saving customer details, fetching individual customer details, and saving GST location data.

In summary, the code changes represent a substantial development effort focused on improving the customer management module of the Envosys backend.  The evolution demonstrates a progressive improvement in code structure, maintainability, and feature completeness, moving from direct SQL queries to a more organized approach using a custom `QueryBuilder` and incorporating pagination, sorting, and error handling.  The consistent timestamps suggest a focused development session.


## 3:15:55 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `customerlDashboardDataSlice` in the Envosys frontend application and its interaction with the `CustomerDashboard` component.  The changes span from approximately 2:42 PM to 3:08 PM on September 24, 2025.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\customerlDashboardDataSlice.ts`**: This file underwent multiple revisions.  The core change involved modifying the `filters` object within the `VesselDashboardState` interface. Initially, it included `vessel_name`, `line_name`, and `serail_id`.  Subsequent edits replaced these with `customer_id`, `customer_type`, and `customer_name`, reflecting a shift from vessel-centric filtering to customer-centric filtering.  The `initialState` was also updated to reflect these filter changes, specifically initializing the new fields to empty strings. Finally, the initial page number in `initialState.pagination` was changed from 0 to 1.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`**: This file was updated at 2:44:46 PM to include `customerDashboardDataSlice` in the `combineReducers` function, integrating the customer dashboard data slice into the Redux store.  The store's middleware was also extended to encompass several APIs, including `customerDataApi`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDashboard.tsx`**:  This component, responsible for rendering the customer dashboard, also saw several revisions.  The most significant changes relate to search and filtering functionality.  The search functionality evolved from searching by Serial ID to searching across multiple customer fields (`customer_id`, `customer_name`, `status`, etc.). The integration with `customerlDashboardDataSlice` improved, allowing for dynamic filtering using the `customerDashboardSetFilters` and `customerDashboardSetPagination` actions.  The `AppGrid` component's pagination was adjusted to use the updated Redux store pagination data correctly. The `handlePage` function and paginationModel were refined to handle pagination more effectively.  Furthermore, the `handleSortChange` function changed to use `setCustomerDashboardSortBy` to update the sort order.  The `SortDropdown` was updated to include selectedValue property to display the currently selected option. The `customerDashboardSortOptions` were added in `common.ts`.  Finally, the `FilterSidebar` component was added, enabling the user to filter data.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\options\common.ts`**: This file was updated at 2:59:02 PM to include  `customerDashboardSortOptions`, providing options for sorting the customer dashboard.

**Overall Pattern**: The changes demonstrate a concerted effort to enhance the customer dashboard's functionality by providing more robust filtering, search, and sorting capabilities. The use of Redux Toolkit simplifies the management of the application state, and the interaction between the component and the Redux store is well-defined through actions and selectors.  The improvements are centered around providing a more user-friendly experience for interacting with customer data.


## 5:19:04 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `customerService.ts` file between 3:31 PM and 4:50 PM on September 24, 2025, primarily focusing on refining API endpoints for customer management.  The changes involve improvements to data filtering and retrieval within the `getAll` function, using a `QueryBuilder` for enhanced query construction.  There are also several functions for handling customer details (`saveCustomerDetails`, `GetCustomerDetails`), GST location information (`SaveGstLocation`), and dashboard card information (`getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`).  The `SaveGstLocation` function stands out due to its complexity, handling nested data insertion across multiple database tables (`customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, `customer_credit_control`, `customer_fac`, `document_upload`).  The `customerService.ts` file consistently uses transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data integrity.

Between 4:32 PM and 4:50 PM, minor adjustments were made to `customerService.ts`, primarily focusing on adding missing semicolons and making minor formatting changes. These changes did not significantly alter the functionality.


Simultaneously,  `masterRoutes.ts` was renamed to `customerRoutes.ts` around 4:52 PM and its imports updated to reflect this change in the file name,  and the routing was reorganized to be more logically grouped under a `CustomerRoutes` router.  This was then reflected in the `index.ts` file which updated its routing to use `CustomerRoutes` instead of `MasterRoutes`. Finally, around 4:59 PM  the `customer.ts` file underwent a modification.  Several fields were commented out in `CustomerGstLocation` interface,  reducing the amount of data fields being handled.


## 5:19:07 PM
The log shows code changes related to a customer dashboard in a React application built with Redux Toolkit and Material UI.  The changes span several files across multiple timestamps on September 24th, 2025.


**`customerlDashboardDataSlice.ts` (3:16:10 PM):** This file defines a Redux slice for managing customer dashboard data. It includes reducers for setting pagination, filters (date range, status, customer ID, type, and name), sort order, and date period ("all," "weekly," "monthly"). The initial state sets default values for pagination and filters.


**`CustomerDashboard.tsx` (3:20:39 PM, 3:24:00 PM, 3:24:37 PM):** This component renders the customer dashboard.  Significant changes involved refining the UI and functionality:

* **Initial Version (3:20:39 PM):** The component fetches customer data using `useGetCustomerDashboardDataQuery` and displays it using `AppGrid`. It includes search, filtering, sorting, and export to Excel functionality.  The filtering is handled by a `FilterSidebar` component. Many unnecessary state variables were present (e.g., `data`, `filteredData`, `paginationModel`).

* **Intermediate Version (3:24:00 PM):**  A minor update likely addresses a bug or improves code clarity.  No significant functional changes are apparent.

* **Final Version (3:24:37 PM):** This version significantly simplifies the component's state management by removing redundant state variables, such as `data`, `filteredData`, and `paginationModel`, relying more heavily on Redux state.


**`customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` (3:26:00 PM, 3:29:55 PM):** This file defines the columns for the customer dashboard data grid. It uses `@mui/x-data-grid`. The two timestamps indicate refinement and potentially bug fixes, but no major functional changes are visible.  The columns include status, customer ID, name, group, PAN number, address, customer type, location, and email. An "Action" column provides a menu for further operations.  A similar structure is used for Customer Booking columns.

**`customer.types.ts` (3:38:13 PM, 3:42:42 PM, 3:43:16 PM):** This file defines TypeScript interfaces and types for customer data, filters, columns, and related entities. There are several interface definitions including `CustomerData`, `CustomerDetails`, `FilterState`, `CustomerDashboardState`.  Key changes across the three timestamps include:

* **3:38:13 PM:** Defines various interfaces for customer data structures.
* **3:42:42 PM and 3:43:16 PM:** `CustomerData` interface is significantly modified in these two commits, changing the `serial_id` type from `number` to `string`. Further, in the second revision, several fields were added to `CustomerData` which were originally declared in `CustomerFormValues` interface.


**`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` (3:46:54 PM):** This component renders a form for managing customer details. It uses the `CustomerDetailsForm` component and initializes the form with default values, which include placeholder data for various arrays.  The default values for the arrays use `Date.now().toString()` for unique `serial_id` values.


In summary, the code changes primarily focus on developing and refining a customer dashboard component. The development involved iteratively improving the UI, integrating Redux for state management, and defining clear data structures using TypeScript.  The most significant changes involved streamlining the `CustomerDashboard.tsx` component's state management and the alteration of the `CustomerData` type in `customer.types.ts`


## 6:19:09 PM
The log shows several code changes related to a backend service for managing customers.  The most significant changes occurred between 5:47 PM and 6:13 PM on 9/24/2025,  focused on the `customerService.ts` file. These changes involved refinements to the `CreateCustomer` function.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\linebookingService.ts` (9/24/2025, 5:31:22 PM):** This file defines services for line bookings, including creation (`create`) and retrieval (`getAll`, `getByVesselVoyageId`). The `create` function inserts line booking data and associated equipment details into respective database tables. The `getAll` function uses a `QueryBuilder` for flexible data retrieval with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities.  It also retrieves distinct values for dropdowns (pol, pod, line_name).


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\models\common\types\customer.ts` (Multiple timestamps):** This file defines various TypeScript interfaces related to customer data.  Multiple updates (5:32:23 PM, 5:34:05 PM, 5:34:31 PM, 6:10:49 PM) show iterative refinements and additions to the interfaces, specifically in `CustomerGstLocation` where some fields were commented out.  The interfaces encompass customer details, GST location information, personal details, alert mappings, credit controls, FAC details, and upload documents.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\customerRoutes.ts` (9/24/2025, 5:39:55 PM and 9/24/2025, 6:16:48 PM):** This file defines Express.js routes for customer management.  The initial version had some inconsistencies in route naming and mappings.  Later update (6:16:48 PM) corrects the inconsistencies.  Routes are defined for fetching dashboard information, saving customer details, saving GST locations, and fetching data.  The later update adds a PUT route for updating customers.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts` (Multiple timestamps):** This file contains the core logic for customer service operations.  The most substantial changes (5:47:38 PM, 5:49:47 PM, 5:52:07 PM, 5:52:32 PM, 5:55:55 PM, 6:04:42 PM, 6:08:31 PM, 6:13:54 PM) center around the `CreateCustomer` function which handles inserting customer data into the database along with related nested information (GST Locations, Key Personal Details, Alerts, Credit Control, and FAC Details).  There is a clear pattern of adding error handling and improving the logic for handling database transactions using `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`. The `getAll` function uses a QueryBuilder for creating and executing database queries. The  `customer_gst_location` table insertion uses `insertMany` initially, changing to `insertQuery` for singular insertion in later updates. The `customer_alerts` table name is also corrected in a later update.  A new `UpdateCustomer` function is added in the final version (6:13:54 PM).


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (9/24/2025, 6:15:41 PM):** This file defines constants for API paths, including paths for customer-related endpoints.  The updates to this file are consistent with renaming and adding routes to handle customer creation and updates.


## 10:46:20 PM
The provided log shows two revisions of the `customerService.ts` file, both on September 24, 2025.  The changes between the two revisions are minimal, indicating that no functional changes were made to the code in this time period.

The file contains various asynchronous functions for interacting with a customer database:

*   `getAll`: Retrieves customer data with pagination and filtering options (status, dates, type, ID, location, name, and sorting).  It uses a `QueryBuilder` for constructing the SQL queries and returns data along with pagination metadata and dropdown options for filtering.

*   `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`: Retrieves dashboard card information (active, inactive, and total customer counts) based on optional date range or time period (weekly, monthly, or all).

*   `saveCustomerDetails`: Saves customer details to the database, generating a unique customer ID. It uses transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).

*   `CreateCustomer`: Creates a new customer record, including GST locations and related details (key personal details, alert mappings, credit controls, and FAC details). This function also uses database transactions.


*   `UpdateCustomer`: The function signature is shown but the function body is truncated in both revisions.  This suggests the function is likely intended for updating customer information.


The code heavily uses parameterized queries and transactions to ensure data integrity and security.  There is extensive logging using the `logger` object, which helps in debugging and monitoring.  The code uses `moment.js` for date manipulation and handles errors by returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  The consistent use of `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps in various database models suggests a well-defined audit trail.  The repeated structure in the `CreateCustomer` function for handling nested details suggests a possible refactoring opportunity to reduce code redundancy in future versions.
