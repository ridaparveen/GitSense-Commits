# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 10:02:00 AM
On September 23, 2025, at 5:14:48 PM, the `vendorServices.ts` file was updated.  This file contains TypeScript code for managing vendor data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting vendors.  The update encompasses three main functions:

* **`getAll`:** This function retrieves a paginated list of vendors. It supports filtering by vendor name and sorting by various fields (defaulting to creation timestamp in descending order).  It uses a `QueryBuilder` class for constructing the database queries and handles pagination and error logging.

* **`addVendor`:** This function adds a new vendor to the database. It performs input validation, ensuring that the `vendor_name` is provided and the `status` is valid. Upon successful insertion, it returns the newly created vendor's data.  Error handling and logging are included.

* **`updateVendor`:** This function updates an existing vendor. It requires a `serial_id` as a parameter and performs input validation for the status field. It returns appropriate status codes depending on whether the vendor was found and successfully updated.  Error handling and logging are included.

All three functions utilize custom database interaction functions (`insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`) from a common utility module, along with custom types and constants defined elsewhere in the project.  The functions consistently log errors using a `logger` object and return standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.  A consistent pattern of comprehensive error handling and logging is observed throughout the code.
