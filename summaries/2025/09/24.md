# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 10:02:00 AM
On September 23, 2025, at 5:14:48 PM, the `vendorServices.ts` file was updated.  This file contains TypeScript code for managing vendor data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting vendors.  The update encompasses three main functions:

* **`getAll`:** This function retrieves a paginated list of vendors. It supports filtering by vendor name and sorting by various fields (defaulting to creation timestamp in descending order).  It uses a `QueryBuilder` class for constructing the database queries and handles pagination and error logging.

* **`addVendor`:** This function adds a new vendor to the database. It performs input validation, ensuring that the `vendor_name` is provided and the `status` is valid. Upon successful insertion, it returns the newly created vendor's data.  Error handling and logging are included.

* **`updateVendor`:** This function updates an existing vendor. It requires a `serial_id` as a parameter and performs input validation for the status field. It returns appropriate status codes depending on whether the vendor was found and successfully updated.  Error handling and logging are included.

All three functions utilize custom database interaction functions (`insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`) from a common utility module, along with custom types and constants defined elsewhere in the project.  The functions consistently log errors using a `logger` object and return standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.  A consistent pattern of comprehensive error handling and logging is observed throughout the code.

The log shows multiple updates to `VendorDetailsPage.tsx` and `VendorDetailsForm.tsx` between 5:17 PM and 5:50 PM on September 23, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the vendor data form and its submission functionality.

`VendorDetailsPage.tsx`:

* **Initial versions (5:17 PM):**  The component was initially created, including basic structure using `PageWrapper`, `VendorDetailsForm`, navigation (`useNavigate`), and an initial state for `vendorData`.  The `useSaveVendorMutation` hook was present but not fully utilized.

* **Adding form submission (5:19 PM - 5:25 PM):** A `handleSubmit` function was added to handle form submission using the `AddVendorDetails` mutation.  Error handling with `react-hot-toast` for success and failure scenarios was also implemented. Initially the success message was "Vessel" instead of "Vendor", and this was corrected around 5:29 PM. The navigation after a successful submission was initially to `/app/master/vessel`,  but was corrected to `/app/master/vendor` around 5:30 PM.


* **Status Dropdown (5:48 PM - 5:50 PM):**  A dropdown to select the vendor status ("Active" or "Inactive") was added using `SelectBox`.  The `handleDropdownChange` function updates the `statusValue` state based on the dropdown selection. The unnecessary conditional rendering of toast messages was removed from 5:49 PM onwards.

* **Simplification (5:50 PM):**  Unnecessary components like `ScreenToolbar` and `ThemedBreadcrumb`  were removed, streamlining the code.

`VendorDetailsForm.tsx`:

* **Initial version (5:23 PM):** The form component was created, using `formik` for form management.  It includes input fields, a tabbed interface (`ThemeTabs`) for "GST Registration Details," "Tariff Details," and "Upload Files," and a submit button.

* **Refactoring (5:42 PM - 5:47 PM):** Field names were updated for consistency, specifically renaming `add_line1` and `add_line2` to `address_1` and `address_2` respectively,  and similarly for telephone fields. The `SelectBox` component's `onChange` handler was updated to correctly use `formik.setFieldValue` for both `country` and `city` around 5:46 PM and 5:47 PM, respectively.


`vendor.types.ts`:

* **Updated (5:43 PM):** This file was updated to reflect the changes in field names from `VendorDetailsForm.tsx`. The `VendorFormValues` interface now uses `address_1`, `address_2`, `telephone_1`, `telephone_2` instead of the previous names.


The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, starting with a basic form and gradually adding features like form submission, error handling, and a status selection dropdown. The updates also show a focus on improving consistency in naming conventions and form handling logic using `formik`.  The final versions are significantly more refined than the initial ones.


## 11:02:02 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` and `VendorDetailsPage.tsx`, with one change to `action.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 4 minutes on September 24th, 2025.

`VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` underwent three revisions. The key change was in the `AppGrid` component's `paginationModel` prop.  Initially, the page and pageSize were directly set. The subsequent revisions improved this by using `vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.page` and `vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.perPage` respectively,  ensuring correct data population from the API response.  This change addresses a potential pagination issue in the earlier version.  No other significant functional changes were made across the three revisions.


`VendorDetailsPage.tsx` was updated twice. The first revision was a complete addition. The second revision, at 11:01:35 AM, added pre-population of the `vendor_name` field in the `vendorData` state using data passed from the location state.  This enables editing existing vendor data. The component uses a form for adding or editing vendor details, making API calls with `useSaveVendorMutation` to save changes.  Success and error messages are displayed using `react-hot-toast`.

`action.tsx` shows the addition of a function  `getVendorActions` which returns an array of actions (currently only Edit)  for a vendor data grid.  It uses  `ReactNode` for icons and labels and takes a navigation function and access object as parameters.
