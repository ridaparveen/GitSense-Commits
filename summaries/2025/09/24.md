# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 10:02:00 AM
On September 23, 2025, at 5:14:48 PM, the `vendorServices.ts` file was updated.  This file contains TypeScript code for managing vendor data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting vendors.  The update encompasses three main functions:

* **`getAll`:** This function retrieves a paginated list of vendors. It supports filtering by vendor name and sorting by various fields (defaulting to creation timestamp in descending order).  It uses a `QueryBuilder` class for constructing the database queries and handles pagination and error logging.

* **`addVendor`:** This function adds a new vendor to the database. It performs input validation, ensuring that the `vendor_name` is provided and the `status` is valid. Upon successful insertion, it returns the newly created vendor's data.  Error handling and logging are included.

* **`updateVendor`:** This function updates an existing vendor. It requires a `serial_id` as a parameter and performs input validation for the status field. It returns appropriate status codes depending on whether the vendor was found and successfully updated.  Error handling and logging are included.

All three functions utilize custom database interaction functions (`insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`) from a common utility module, along with custom types and constants defined elsewhere in the project.  The functions consistently log errors using a `logger` object and return standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.  A consistent pattern of comprehensive error handling and logging is observed throughout the code.


## 10:02:05 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `VendorDetailsPage.tsx` and `VendorDetailsForm.tsx` between 5:17 PM and 5:50 PM on September 23, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the vendor data form and its submission functionality.

`VendorDetailsPage.tsx`:

* **Initial versions (5:17 PM):**  The component was initially created, including basic structure using `PageWrapper`, `VendorDetailsForm`, navigation (`useNavigate`), and an initial state for `vendorData`.  The `useSaveVendorMutation` hook was present but not fully utilized.

* **Adding form submission (5:19 PM - 5:25 PM):** A `handleSubmit` function was added to handle form submission using the `AddVendorDetails` mutation.  Error handling with `react-hot-toast` for success and failure scenarios was also implemented. Initially the success message was "Vessel" instead of "Vendor", and this was corrected around 5:29 PM. The navigation after a successful submission was initially to `/app/master/vessel`,  but was corrected to `/app/master/vendor` around 5:30 PM.


* **Status Dropdown (5:48 PM - 5:50 PM):**  A dropdown to select the vendor status ("Active" or "Inactive") was added using `SelectBox`.  The `handleDropdownChange` function updates the `statusValue` state based on the dropdown selection. The unnecessary conditional rendering of toast messages was removed from 5:49 PM onwards.

* **Simplification (5:50 PM):**  Unnecessary components like `ScreenToolbar` and `ThemedBreadcrumb`  were removed, streamlining the code.

`VendorDetailsForm.tsx`:

* **Initial version (5:23 PM):** The form component was created, using `formik` for form management.  It includes input fields, a tabbed interface (`ThemeTabs`) for "GST Registration Details," "Tariff Details," and "Upload Files," and a submit button.

* **Refactoring (5:42 PM - 5:47 PM):** Field names were updated for consistency, specifically renaming `add_line1` and `add_line2` to `address_1` and `address_2` respectively,  and similarly for telephone fields. The `SelectBox` component's `onChange` handler was updated to correctly use `formik.setFieldValue` for both `country` and `city` around 5:46 PM and 5:47 PM, respectively.


`vendor.types.ts`:

* **Updated (5:43 PM):** This file was updated to reflect the changes in field names from `VendorDetailsForm.tsx`. The `VendorFormValues` interface now uses `address_1`, `address_2`, `telephone_1`, `telephone_2` instead of the previous names.


The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, starting with a basic form and gradually adding features like form submission, error handling, and a status selection dropdown. The updates also show a focus on improving consistency in naming conventions and form handling logic using `formik`.  The final versions are significantly more refined than the initial ones.


## 11:02:02 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` and `VendorDetailsPage.tsx`, with one change to `action.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 4 minutes on September 24th, 2025.

`VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` underwent three revisions. The key change was in the `AppGrid` component's `paginationModel` prop.  Initially, the page and pageSize were directly set. The subsequent revisions improved this by using `vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.page` and `vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.perPage` respectively,  ensuring correct data population from the API response.  This change addresses a potential pagination issue in the earlier version.  No other significant functional changes were made across the three revisions.


`VendorDetailsPage.tsx` was updated twice. The first revision was a complete addition. The second revision, at 11:01:35 AM, added pre-population of the `vendor_name` field in the `vendorData` state using data passed from the location state.  This enables editing existing vendor data. The component uses a form for adding or editing vendor details, making API calls with `useSaveVendorMutation` to save changes.  Success and error messages are displayed using `react-hot-toast`.

`action.tsx` shows the addition of a function  `getVendorActions` which returns an array of actions (currently only Edit)  for a vendor data grid.  It uses  `ReactNode` for icons and labels and takes a navigation function and access object as parameters.


## 12:02:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `vendorServices.ts` file and one revision to `vendorRoutes.ts` between 11:19 AM and 11:52 AM on September 24, 2025.  The `vendorServices.ts` file underwent several iterations, primarily focusing on the implementation of vendor management functionalities.

Initially, the `vendorServices.ts` file contained functions for `getAll`, `addVendor`, and `updateVendor`.  These functions utilized a custom `QueryBuilder` for database interactions, handled pagination and sorting, and implemented appropriate HTTP status code responses.  A key change between 11:23 AM and 11:27 AM involved correcting a logical error in the `addVendor` function's status validation.

Between 11:29 AM and 11:30 AM, a new function, `getVendorCardInfo`, was added to `vendorServices.ts`. This function retrieves vendor count information (active, inactive, and total) based on optional date range (`fromDate`, `toDate`) and filtering options ("weekly", "monthly", "all").  The corresponding route was added in `vendorRoutes.ts` at 11:30:55 AM.

Minor changes in `vendorServices.ts` after 11:30 AM  included removal of unnecessary `data` field in the response of `addVendor` function, and at 11:52 AM, the `getVendorCardInfo` function was updated to use uppercase `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` for status comparison in the SQL query to ensure consistency.  Throughout the modifications, error handling using `logger` and appropriate HTTP status codes remained consistent across all functions.  The core functionality of the vendor services remained consistent throughout the revisions, primarily focused on CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with added dashboard functionality.


## 12:02:09 PM
The log shows a series of code changes made to the Envosys frontend between 11:02 AM and 11:59 AM on September 24, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `VendorDetailsPage.tsx` component and the `vendorDataApi.ts` file, focusing on vendor data management.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\vendor\VendorDetailsPage.tsx`:**

This file underwent numerous revisions throughout the log.  Early changes (11:02 AM - 11:03 AM) focused on initial implementation, including setting up state for vendor details using `useState` and handling form submission (`handleSubmit`) using  `useSaveVendorMutation` for creating vendors.  Later changes (11:10 AM onwards) introduced `useUpdateVendorMutation` to handle vendor updates, significantly altering the `handleSubmit` function to conditionally use either `AddVendorDetails` or `UpdateVendorDetails` based on the `formAction` prop.  Further edits refined error handling, success messages using `react-hot-toast`, and corrected the way `serial_id` was accessed and handled within the `handleSubmit` function. The final change (11:22 AM onwards) updated the `options` for the status `SelectBox` to use uppercase values ("ACTIVE", "INACTIVE") reflecting backend changes.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\vendorDataApi.ts`:**

This file, containing the API calls for vendor data, saw modifications primarily around the `updateVendor` mutation.  Initially, the update endpoint was incorrectly defined.  Multiple revisions corrected the endpoint URL to correctly handle the `serial_id` parameter for updating existing records, resulting in `/api/vendor/update/${serial_id}`.  Additional logging was added to aid debugging (11:08 AM and 11:13 AM).  The `getVendorCardVData` endpoint was renamed to `getVendorCardData` at 11:43 AM.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`:**

This file, related to Redux store configuration, shows the addition of `vendorDataApi.middleware` at 11:45 AM, integrating the vendor API calls into the Redux store.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\OverviewContainer.tsx`:**

This component, displaying vendor dashboard overview, was updated (11:45 AM - 11:53 AM) to fetch data using `useGetVendorCardDataQuery` from `vendorDataApi` and correctly display vendor counts. A crucial change was updating the navigation route for adding a new vendor from `/app/master/vessel_voyage/new_vessel_voyage` to the appropriate `/app/master/vendor/new_vendor` route.  Unnecessary imports were also removed in the final version.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\VendorDashboard.tsx`:**

This component, rendering the vendor dashboard, shows a similar pattern: initial implementation (11:45 AM), refined search functionality (removing unnecessary state), and removal of unused state variables, resulting in a cleaner, more efficient component.  The use of `vendorDashboardData` from the API call in `generateExcel` function improved data consistency.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\options\common.ts`:**

This file shows no changes related to vendor data, it only contains other options related to other parts of the application.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\VendorDetailsForm.tsx`:**

This component is the form for vendor creation and update. The changes reflect in the  `VendorDetailsForm`  component, which was added at 11:59 AM, and seems to be the final version reflecting the structure and functionality of the Vendor creation/update form.


In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort on building and refining the vendor management features in the Envosys frontend, particularly improving API interactions, data handling, and user interface elements.  The iterative process of refining the API endpoint for updating vendors and fixing several logic errors in the `VendorDetailsPage` component are particularly noteworthy.


## 3:15:53 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the backend code of an Envosys application, primarily focused on customer management.  The key changes revolve around the `customerService.ts` and `customer.ts` files.

**`customer.ts` (9/24/2025, 2:29:29 PM & 9/24/2025, 2:48:18 PM):**  This file, defining customer data types, underwent two revisions.  The changes primarily involved modifications to the `GetCustomerParams` interface. Initially, parameters like `vessel_name`, `pol`, and `voyage` were present.  The second revision replaced these with `customer_name` and removed the others, suggesting a refactoring of the customer search/retrieval functionality to focus on customer-specific attributes (`customer_name`, `customer_type`, `customer_id`, `location`). The file also defines interfaces for various customer-related details, including GST location, key personal details, alert mappings, credit control, and facility (FAC) details. These suggest a comprehensive customer data model.

**`customerService.ts` (9/24/2025, 2:25:34 PM, 9/24/2025, 2:34:42 PM, 9/24/2025, 2:36:52 PM & 9/24/2025, 2:48:11 PM):** This file contains the core customer service logic.  It saw multiple revisions throughout the afternoon of September 24th, 2025.  The changes reflect iterative improvements and additions to the functionality.

* **Initial version (2:25:34 PM):**  Focused on basic customer retrieval (`getCustomer`), dashboard card information (`getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`), customer details saving (`saveCustomerDetails`), and GST location saving (`SaveGstLocation`).  This version used direct SQL queries.

* **Subsequent versions (2:34:42 PM, 2:36:52 PM, 2:48:11 PM):** Introduced a `QueryBuilder` class to improve query construction and maintainability.  The `getAll` function was added, implementing pagination and sorting capabilities using the `QueryBuilder`.  The `getAll` function's query parameters were adjusted to align with the changes made in `customer.ts`. Specifically, the `name` parameter was renamed to `customer_name` for clarity. The `getAll` function was also updated to include options query for dropdowns.  These later versions indicate a shift towards better structured, more robust data access, with improved error handling via the `logger` and a clearer separation of concerns.  Moment.js was also added for date formatting.

**`masterRoutes.ts` (9/24/2025, 2:35:17 PM):** This file defines the API routes for the customer management endpoints, demonstrating how the `customerService` functions are exposed as API endpoints. The routes include endpoints for retrieving customer dashboard information, saving customer details, fetching individual customer details, and saving GST location data.

In summary, the code changes represent a substantial development effort focused on improving the customer management module of the Envosys backend.  The evolution demonstrates a progressive improvement in code structure, maintainability, and feature completeness, moving from direct SQL queries to a more organized approach using a custom `QueryBuilder` and incorporating pagination, sorting, and error handling.  The consistent timestamps suggest a focused development session.
