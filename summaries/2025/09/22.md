# Activity Summary for 9/22/2025

## 11:35:34 AM
On September 22nd, 2025, significant changes were made to the `envosys-backend` application.

At 10:35:41 AM, the `index.ts` file within the `src/routes` directory was updated. This file acts as a routing hub, registering various API endpoints.  The update involved registering new routes for authentication (`AuthRoutes`), master data (`MasterRoutes`), line bookings (`LineBookingRoutes`), customer bookings (`CustomerBookingRoutes`), document uploads (`DocumentRoutes`), vessels (`VesselRoutes`), vessel and voyages (`VesselAndVoyageRoutes`), and vendors (`VendorRoutes`).  An autocomplete endpoint using the `getAll` service function was also added.  The code uses the `express` router to define and organize these routes.

Later, at 11:25:33 AM, the `vendorServices.ts` file (located in `src/services`) was modified. This file contains functions for managing vendor data.  The update introduced three key functions: `getAll`, `addVendor`, and `updateVendor`.  `getAll` retrieves vendor data with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities. `addVendor` creates new vendor entries, and `updateVendor` updates existing ones.  All three functions include robust error handling, logging errors using a logger, and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  The code uses a custom `QueryBuilder` class for database interactions and leverages parameterized queries for security.  Input validation is performed to prevent invalid data from being accepted.
