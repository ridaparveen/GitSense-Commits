# Activity Summary for 9/22/2025

## 11:35:34 AM
On September 22nd, 2025, significant changes were made to the `envosys-backend` application.

At 10:35:41 AM, the `index.ts` file within the `src/routes` directory was updated. This file acts as a routing hub, registering various API endpoints.  The update involved registering new routes for authentication (`AuthRoutes`), master data (`MasterRoutes`), line bookings (`LineBookingRoutes`), customer bookings (`CustomerBookingRoutes`), document uploads (`DocumentRoutes`), vessels (`VesselRoutes`), vessel and voyages (`VesselAndVoyageRoutes`), and vendors (`VendorRoutes`).  An autocomplete endpoint using the `getAll` service function was also added.  The code uses the `express` router to define and organize these routes.

Later, at 11:25:33 AM, the `vendorServices.ts` file (located in `src/services`) was modified. This file contains functions for managing vendor data.  The update introduced three key functions: `getAll`, `addVendor`, and `updateVendor`.  `getAll` retrieves vendor data with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities. `addVendor` creates new vendor entries, and `updateVendor` updates existing ones.  All three functions include robust error handling, logging errors using a logger, and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  The code uses a custom `QueryBuilder` class for database interactions and leverages parameterized queries for security.  Input validation is performed to prevent invalid data from being accepted.


## 11:35:58 AM
The log shows modifications to components related to a vessel voyage dashboard in a React application.  The `OverviewContainer.tsx` component underwent significant changes between 11:15 AM and 11:29 AM.  Initially, it displayed static data (`vesselVoyogeData`).  Subsequent updates integrated Redux using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to fetch and display dynamic voyage data from the `voyageDashboardSlice` and `vesselAndVoyageDataApi`.  The data displayed was modified from displaying counts of vessels to counts of voyages.  A `DatePeriodSelector` component was added to allow filtering of data based on a date range and period.

The `voyageDashboardSlice.ts` file (modified at 11:20:07 AM) defines Redux slices for managing pagination, filters (date range, status, vessel name, line name, serial ID), and sorting of vessel voyage data.  The `setDateRange` and `setPeriod` actions are used by `OverviewContainer.tsx` to update date range and period selection respectively.

The `store.ts` file (modified at 11:20:48 AM) configures the Redux store, including the `voyageDashboardSlice` and several other reducers and API middleware.

Finally, the `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` component (modified between 11:33 AM and 11:35 AM) displays a table of vessel voyage data using `AppGrid`. The initial version used static data from `vesselData`, but this was later replaced by fetching data dynamically from `useFetchVoyageDashboardDataQuery` with filters and pagination from Redux's `voyageDashboardSlice`. The component includes search, filtering, sorting, and data export functionalities.  A key change here was the replacement of  the data source for the `AppGrid` from local state to the fetched `vesselVoyageDashboardData`.  Initially, the commented out code for the filter parameter showed it was intended to use the state from the redux store.


## 12:35:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file between 11:53 AM and 11:59 AM on September 22, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `getAll` function, specifically its pagination logic.

Initially, the offset calculation in `getAll` was incorrect: `offset = (Number(page) - 1) * Number(perPage);`.  This was changed to `offset = Number(page) * Number(perPage);` at 11:55:19 AM, then reverted back to the original correct calculation at 11:59:08 AM.  A `console.log` statement was added to debug the offset value at 11:56:14 AM.

Between 11:53:33 AM and 11:54:34 AM, a minor correction was made in the `getAll` function's response.  The `total` count in pagination was updated to include a fallback value of 0 using the nullish coalescing operator (`|| 0`).

No other significant functional changes were made to the other functions (`CreateVesselAndVoyage`, `fetchVesselAndVoyageData`, `getVesselAndVoyageDashboardCardInfo`, `UpdateVesselAndVoyage`) across the revisions.  These functions consistently use database interaction functions (`insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`) and handle transactions using `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` blocks.  They also consistently return JSON responses with status indicators ("success" or "error").  The code shows consistent use of asynchronous functions and error handling.


## 12:36:08 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` component and a related `common.ts` file between 11:36 AM and 12:34 PM on September 22, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is enhancing the functionality and user interface of a vessel voyage dashboard.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` Changes:**

* **Initial Commit (11:36:02 AM):** This commit established the basic structure of the component, including search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and data export functionality.  It utilized dummy data and  local state management.

* **Redux Integration (11:39:49 AM):**  `useDispatch` was added, shifting from local state to Redux for pagination management using the `voyageDashboardSetPagination` action.

* **API Data Fetching (11:39:49 AM - 11:47:48 AM):** Several commits involved refining how data is fetched from the API (`useFetchVoyageDashboardDataQuery`). Initially, all filter parameters were passed, but this was later commented out. The final version uses a subset of the Redux state for filtering and pagination.  The `AppGrid` component was updated to use the API's pagination data (`vesselVoyageDashboardData?.pagination?.total`).


* **Sorting Enhancement (11:43:54 AM - 11:47:48 AM):** The `handleSortChange` function was modified to dispatch Redux actions (`setVoyageDashboardSortBy` and `voyageDashboardSetPagination`) to update the sort order and reset pagination on sort changes. A `selectedValue` prop was added to the `SortDropdown` component to reflect the current sort selection.

* **Search Input Name Change (12:25:29 PM):** The `name` attribute of the search `InputBox` was changed from `"search_booking_no"` to `"vessel_name"`.

* **Filter Integration (12:29:38 PM - 12:34:13 PM):**  Significant changes focused on integrating the filter sidebar, replacing `handleFilterUpdate` with `handleFilterChange` and `handleClearFilters` to manage filters via Redux using  `voyageDashboardSetFilters` action.  The filter's `key` for date range was changed from `"dateRange"` to `"created_at"`. The FilterSidebar now correctly uses the Redux store's filters. Pagination is reset to the first page upon applying or clearing filters. The page number is updated in `handleFilterChange` from 0 to 1 to reflect the correct page after filter application.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\options\common.ts` Changes:**

* **One commit (11:45:05 AM):** This commit added or modified sort options (`sortOptions`) within the `common.ts` file to provide ascending and descending options for sorting by Vessel Name.  There were commented-out lines, which suggests additional sorting options might have been considered before being removed.

**Recurring Patterns:**

* Consistent use of React, Redux, and TypeScript.
* Frequent updates to pagination handling to ensure the correct page is displayed after user interactions.
* The overall development pattern suggests an iterative process, where features are gradually added and improved.


The final version of `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` uses Redux to manage state and fetching data from an API. The data is displayed in an `AppGrid` component with robust search, filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.  Date formatting is added to several columns within `VESSEL_VOYAGE_COLUMNS`.


## 3:13:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file between 12:54 PM and 3:07 PM on September 22, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be debugging and logging within the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` function.

Initially, the code lacked sufficient logging to track the `vesselVoyage` object being passed into the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` function.  This was addressed by adding `console.log("===vesselvoayge", vesselVoyage);` and later improved to  `console.log("===vesselvoayge", req.body);` to show the entire request body at 2:59 PM and 3:07 PM, respectively.  This suggests an issue with the data being received or processed in that function.

Between the first and second revision (12:54 PM and 1:13 PM), a minor change was made to the `getAll` function's response, simplifying the `pagination` object's structure by removing unnecessary type casting for `page` and `perPage` properties.  The other commits between 1:13PM and 3:07PM mostly involved debugging and adding logging, with no significant functional changes beyond the logging adjustments already mentioned. The 2:56 PM and onwards commits show commented-out lines in the `voyagePayload`  within the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` function suggesting further investigation or modification of the data being processed. There were no changes to the database queries themselves. All functions consistently handle errors by returning a 500 Internal Server Error response.


## 3:13:28 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx` and related files between 12:41 PM and 2:52 PM on September 22, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is on the `VesselVoyageDashboard` component, which displays and allows filtering, sorting, and exporting of vessel voyage data.  Several iterations refine the filtering options and data handling.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx`**: This file underwent extensive revision.  Early changes (12:41 PM - 12:45 PM) focused on adding functionality to dynamically generate filter options ("POL" and "Vessel Name") based on fetched data.  Later changes (12:53 PM - 1:17 PM) adjusted filter clearing logic, changed the "Vessel Name" filter key to "voyage," and updated the Excel export data source. Further changes (2:20 PM - 2:37 PM) involved refining access control (`access` prop) and updating the navigation paths in the actions. Finally (2:37 PM - 2:52 PM), these changes remove unneeded state variables (`data`, `filteredData`) and simplifies the component.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\action.tsx`**: This file, handling actions for the vessel voyage dashboard, was modified to adjust the navigation path for editing vessel voyages and change access control from `vesselMenu` to `vesselVoyageMenu`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\vessel-voyage-columns.tsx`**: This file, defining columns for the data grid, was updated to reflect the changes in action handling.  It uses the updated `action.tsx` file for actions.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\voyageDashboardSlice.ts`**:  A change at 1:14 PM updated the initial page number in the Redux slice from 0 to 1. No other significant changes.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`**: This page handling details of a vessel voyage was updated at the end to pass only `vesselVoyage` data to the form.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\vessel-voyage.types.ts`**: This type definition file was modified to include a `vesselAndVoyage` interface, which contains the  `VesselVoyageFormValue`, reflecting structural changes in data handling.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`**: This form component for vessel voyage details was significantly revised multiple times (2:42 PM - 3:11 PM). The major changes include correcting the `initialvalues` prop type, removing unnecessary state and useEffect hook, removing the `InputGroupedButton` component, and changing the submit button text based on mode ("add" or "edit").  Finally the form is updated to accept `vesselAndVoyage` type.


**Recurring elements and patterns:**  The consistent modifications across these files indicate a focused effort to improve the data fetching, filtering, and display within the vessel voyage dashboard, enhancing the user experience and improving data integrity.  The use of Redux for state management is evident throughout the code.  The repeated updates to the navigation paths and access control within action files show refinement and consistency of the application flow.


## 4:13:15 PM
The log shows iterative development of a React component for managing vessel voyage details.  The primary files involved are `VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` and `VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`.

`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` underwent significant changes between 3:14:26 PM and 3:23:21 PM.  Initially, the form lacked the "Vessel Name" input field and  the field names within `formik` were not fully qualified (e.g., `pol` instead of `vesselVoyage.pol`).  Subsequent commits corrected this, adding the "Vessel Name" input and correctly referencing all form fields under the `vesselVoyage` nested object.  The final commit at 3:23:21 PM  completed this refactoring.

`VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx` was also modified extensively.  Changes focused on data fetching and handling using `useFetchVoyageDetailsQuery`,  `useCreateVoygeMutation`, and later `useUpdateVoyageMutation`. There's a clear evolution in how API responses are handled. Initially, the component directly used the API response data. It then progressed to mapping the API response into a more structured form suitable for the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` and, finally to using separate create and update mutations based on the `formAction` prop.  A notable change at 3:53:00 PM introduced `useUpdateVoyageMutation` for handling updates, and the logic was refined to clearly separate create and update operations at 3:55:34 PM. The initial state for `vessalData` also changed to include `serial_id` at 4:00:25 PM reflecting changes in the `vesselAndVoyage` type definition.  Finally, there's a correction in how `payload` is constructed at 4:08:24 PM ensuring `serial_id` is correctly nested within `vesselVoyage`.  The `useEffect` hook handling the API response was improved at 3:35:30 PM to handle potential null values and format date strings appropriately. The title of the page also changed to reflect the edit/add mode at the same timestamp.


The overall pattern is a gradual refinement of the component, addressing initial omissions, improving data handling, separating API calls for create and update operations, and enhancing error handling.  The time period between 3:35:30 PM and 4:08:24 PM shows major improvements in data handling and form submission logic.
