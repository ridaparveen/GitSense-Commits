# Activity Summary for 9/4/2025

## 11:33:25 AM
The log shows several revisions to `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` and `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` components between 11:01 AM and 11:22 AM on September 4th, 2025.  The main focus is on managing GST locations for customers.

`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`:  The component renders a form to manage GST locations.  Changes include:

* **11:01 AM:** Initial version.  The component fetches customer details, handles adding, editing, and deleting GST locations using Formik. It displays customer information and a table of GST locations.
* **11:02 AM:** Added a `handleDropdownChange` function to handle changes in a select box (initially named "transportaion_mode", later changed to "status").  The select box is for managing the status of the GST locations (Active/Inactive).
* **11:03 AM:**  Minor UI change - removing `<form>` tag from the root and adding `onClick` to the Submit button in order to trigger the `formik.handleSubmit()` function.  This was likely a fix to ensure form submission worked correctly.
* **11:03 AM (second revision):** The `SelectBox`'s `name` attribute was changed from `"transportaion_mode"` to `"status"`.
* **11:09 AM:**  The `formik` `initialValues` are updated to include an initial `status` for GST locations, defaulting to "active" if no locations exist. The `SelectBox` for status is updated to use `formik.values.status` for its value.


`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`: This component, added later in the log, is a form for managing customer details (not just GST).

* **11:20 AM:** Initial version. This component handles the creation and updating of customer details. It uses Formik, various input components and fetches customer details using `useGetCustomerDetailsQuery`.  It also includes a navigation mechanism to go back to the GST location page.  Importantly, it handles adding new GST locations and updating existing ones by interacting with the `existingGstLocations` passed from the navigation state. A `saveGstLoaction` mutation is used to persist data.
* **11:21 AM:** Minor correction in `initialValues` within `useFormik`, specifically setting the `serial_id` to either the value from the location state or a newly generated timestamp using `Date.now()`.
* **11:22 AM:**  Further minor adjustment of `serial_id` handling in the `initialValues` of `useFormik`.  The unnecessary comma was removed.


`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`: This page uses `CustomerDetailsForm`. It initializes a `customerData` state with default values for various customer attributes, including arrays for related details like GST registration. The creation of default values implies this is a form for creating new customer records.

`customer.types.ts`: This file defines TypeScript interfaces for customer data and related entities, used by both `GstCustomerLocation` and `CustomerDetailsForm`.  It shows a comprehensive data model for customers.


Recurring patterns:  The code uses a consistent structure for UI components (`PageWrapper`, `InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `Button`), Formik for form management, and React Router for navigation.  The use of `state` in React Router's navigation is consistent to pass data between components. There is extensive use of `console.log` statements for debugging purposes.  The code heavily relies on TypeScript interfaces for type safety.  The application seems to be making API calls to a backend (`customerDataApi`).
