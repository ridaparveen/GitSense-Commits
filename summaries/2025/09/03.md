# Activity Summary for 9/3/2025

## 2:12:03 PM
The log shows several revisions to `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` and one revision to `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` between 11:20 AM and 12:06 PM on September 3, 2025.  The `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` file underwent significant changes related to data handling and backend interaction.

Initially, `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` focused on displaying and manipulating GST location data within a form.  The `onSubmit` handler initially only logged values; later versions integrated `useSaveGstLoactionMutation` to send data to the backend, iterating through each GST location and saving it individually, ensuring each includes the `customer_id`.  The `SelectBox` component's default value changed from "" to "active". The display of "Customer Group" was corrected to use `customerData?.group` instead of `customerData?.name`.

In the final version of `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`,  the `customer_id` is consistently included when navigating to  `/app/master/customer/addNewCustomerForm`, improving data consistency.  The file consistently uses the `formik` library for form management, handling additions, deletions, and edits of GST locations.

`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` was updated to handle both adding and updating customer details, including GST information.  It utilizes the `useSaveGstLoactionMutation` hook to interact with the backend.  The component receives initial values (`initialvalues`) as props.  The `onSubmit` now handles saving data using `saveGstLoaction` and redirects to `/app/master/customer/gst-location` with relevant state, notably including the `customer_id`.  This component extensively uses various input components (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `AutocompleteBox`).  It's notable that the "Add GST" functionality was changed to either "Add" or "Update" depending on the context (new entry vs edit).


## 4:21:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `envosys-frontend` application, primarily focused on refining customer data handling and UI components.  The most significant changes involve the `customer.types.ts` file and related components.

Between **2:21 PM and 2:29 PM**,  the `customer-columns.tsx` file and `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` underwent several iterations. These revisions focused on adjusting the column definitions for customer data display.  There was a shift in how address fields were structured within both files and associated types, initially with `res_add` and subsequently changing to `address_1` and `address_2`.  These changes are reflected consistently across the related components.

A major restructuring occurred in the `customer.types.ts` file between **2:24 PM and 4:15 PM**. The `KeyPersonalList`, `AlertMappingList`, and `FacList` interfaces were significantly altered, with many fields renamed for clarity and consistency (e.g., `res_tel` to `mobile_no`, `alerts` to `alert_event`).  Importantly, a `serial_id` field was added to several interfaces and the `CustomerFormValues` interface.  This change was then reflected in `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` between **2:27PM and 4:16 PM**, where default values for `serial_id` were added to the different data arrays. The `KeyPersonal` component's logic also adapted, simplifying its `onChange` handler from explicitly mapping and copying `id` to `serial_id` to a direct pass-through in the later revisions.


The final revisions, around **4:15 PM**, involved improving the data structure for `FacList`, renaming fields for better understanding and consistency with other data structures. The associated `customer-columns.tsx` file was updated to reflect these changes.  The overall pattern points towards a consistent effort to improve data type definitions and UI consistency related to customer details.  The consistent use of `Date.now()` to provide default values indicates a likely approach to assigning unique identifiers.
