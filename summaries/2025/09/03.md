# Activity Summary for 9/3/2025

## 2:12:03 PM
The log shows several revisions to `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` and one revision to `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` between 11:20 AM and 12:06 PM on September 3, 2025.  The `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` file underwent significant changes related to data handling and backend interaction.

Initially, `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` focused on displaying and manipulating GST location data within a form.  The `onSubmit` handler initially only logged values; later versions integrated `useSaveGstLoactionMutation` to send data to the backend, iterating through each GST location and saving it individually, ensuring each includes the `customer_id`.  The `SelectBox` component's default value changed from "" to "active". The display of "Customer Group" was corrected to use `customerData?.group` instead of `customerData?.name`.

In the final version of `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`,  the `customer_id` is consistently included when navigating to  `/app/master/customer/addNewCustomerForm`, improving data consistency.  The file consistently uses the `formik` library for form management, handling additions, deletions, and edits of GST locations.

`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` was updated to handle both adding and updating customer details, including GST information.  It utilizes the `useSaveGstLoactionMutation` hook to interact with the backend.  The component receives initial values (`initialvalues`) as props.  The `onSubmit` now handles saving data using `saveGstLoaction` and redirects to `/app/master/customer/gst-location` with relevant state, notably including the `customer_id`.  This component extensively uses various input components (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `AutocompleteBox`).  It's notable that the "Add GST" functionality was changed to either "Add" or "Update" depending on the context (new entry vs edit).
