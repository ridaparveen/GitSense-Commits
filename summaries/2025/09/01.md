# Activity Summary for 9/1/2025

## 12:10:19 PM
The log shows several modifications to two files between 11:03 AM and 11:40 AM on September 1st, 2025.

**`vesselDataApi.ts`:** This file, related to API calls for vessel data, underwent two changes.  The first change (11:03:02 AM) introduced an API endpoint, `getVesselCardVData`,  along with its corresponding hook, `useGetVesselCardVDataQuery`.  The second change (11:03:38 AM), a minor update, removed the `cardDetails` tag type from the `tagTypes` array.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx`:** This React component, responsible for displaying vessel overview data, underwent numerous revisions focusing on implementing a time-period filter.  Initially (11:04:30 AM), it fetched data using `useGetVesselCardVDataQuery` with date parameters from the Redux store. The component was then modified multiple times (between 11:05:12 AM and 11:40:06 AM) to add state management for time filter (`timeFilter` state variable and `setTimeFilter` function). The API call was changed from `useGetVesselCardVDataQuery` to `useFetchVesselDashboardDataQuery`, and the filter parameter was incorporated into the API call.  The `onChange` handler for the SelectBox was refined repeatedly to correctly handle different input types from the SelectBox component, ultimately settling on extracting the value irrespective of whether the input was a string or an object.  The `name` property of the `SelectBox` component was changed from `time-period-filter` to `createdAt` and finally back to `time-period-filter` during these iterations. The final version (11:40:06 AM) uses `useFetchVesselDashboardDataQuery` to fetch data based on the selected `timeFilter`.  The filtering logic appears finalized at this stage.
