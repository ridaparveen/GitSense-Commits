# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 10:52:15 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-thirdparty\src\controller\external\invoice.controller.ts`, both made on September 5th, 2025.  The changes between the two timestamps (10:24:51 AM and 10:25:26 AM) are insignificant; the code is identical in both entries.

The file contains a TypeScript function `getAll` which retrieves invoice data from a database.  The function dynamically selects tables ("cng_invoice," "spr_invoice," etc.) and joins based on the `req.companyname` parameter, handling "CENTRAL NATIONAL GOTTESMAN, INC." and "SP RICHARDS COMPANY" specifically.  It constructs and executes SQL queries to fetch paginated invoice data with filtering and ordering capabilities based on parameters like `fromDate`, `toDate`, `invoice_no`, and `mblno`.  The results, along with pagination metadata, are returned as a JSON response.  Error handling is included, logging API usage with an api_key_id, and distinguishing between client-side errors (400) and server-side errors (500).  The code uses parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities, although the use of string concatenation for building the `WHERE` clause raises a minor concern unless the inputs are properly sanitized.
