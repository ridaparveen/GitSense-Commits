# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 10:52:15 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-thirdparty\src\controller\external\invoice.controller.ts`, both made on September 5th, 2025.  The changes between the two timestamps (10:24:51 AM and 10:25:26 AM) are insignificant; the code is identical in both entries.

The file contains a TypeScript function `getAll` which retrieves invoice data from a database.  The function dynamically selects tables ("cng_invoice," "spr_invoice," etc.) and joins based on the `req.companyname` parameter, handling "CENTRAL NATIONAL GOTTESMAN, INC." and "SP RICHARDS COMPANY" specifically.  It constructs and executes SQL queries to fetch paginated invoice data with filtering and ordering capabilities based on parameters like `fromDate`, `toDate`, `invoice_no`, and `mblno`.  The results, along with pagination metadata, are returned as a JSON response.  Error handling is included, logging API usage with an api_key_id, and distinguishing between client-side errors (400) and server-side errors (500).  The code uses parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities, although the use of string concatenation for building the `WHERE` clause raises a minor concern unless the inputs are properly sanitized.


## 11:26:26 AM
The `customerService.ts` file contains several functions related to customer management.  On September 5th, 2025, at 11:11:27 AM, significant changes were made to this file.

The `getCustomer` function retrieves customer data based on various search criteria (search term, status, location, customer type, ID, and date range), allowing for sorting. It also constructs and executes a query to fetch options for dropdown menus.


The `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo` function fetches summarized customer information (active, inactive, and total customers) based on date range or predefined filters ("weekly," "monthly," or "all").


The `saveCustomerDetails` function saves new customer details, generating a unique `customer_id` and using transactions to ensure data consistency.


The `GetCustomerDetails` function retrieves detailed customer information, including GST location details, using separate queries and error handling for cases when a customer isn't found.


The `SaveGstLocation` function handles saving GST location details.  It sanitizes input data, converting empty strings to NULL values.  This function utilizes transactions and performs multiple inserts into related tables (`customer_gst_location`, `customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, `customer_credit_control`) based on the provided request body.  The data is sanitized before insertion.  The function includes error handling and returns appropriate status codes.

A recurring pattern is the use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for database interactions and the consistent use of a common structure for API responses (status, data, message or error).  The code extensively uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  There's also a notable emphasis on transaction management using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` for data integrity.


## 11:26:35 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `GstCustomerLocation.tsx`, a React component responsible for managing GST location data for customers.  The primary changes revolve around the `onSubmit` function within the `useFormik` hook.

Initially, the `onSubmit` function directly called `saveGstLoaction` with the form values.  Between 11:05:38 AM and 11:06:21 AM, the code was modified to include the `customer_id` explicitly within the object sent to `saveGstLoaction`.  This ensures that the customer ID is included in the API request.

Further revisions between 11:06:21 AM and 11:16:05 AM focused on refining how the data is submitted.  The `finalValues` object was introduced to explicitly structure the data sent to the backend, improving code readability and maintainability. The most significant change involved the argument passed to `saveGstLoaction` which oscillated between sending the entire `finalValues` object and only `values.gstLocations`, ultimately settling on sending only `values.gstLocations` at 11:16:05 AM. The addition of `console.log` statements throughout these revisions aids in debugging and tracking data flow.  All changes were made within a short time span on September 5th, 2025.  No structural changes to the UI are apparent from the provided logs.


## 12:26:48 PM
The log shows significant changes related to customer GST location management in a React application using Redux and RTK Query.  The main updates revolve around the `customerGstLocationSlice.ts` and `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` files.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\customerGstLocationSlice.ts`**: This file, initially containing comprehensive Redux logic for managing GST location data (adding, updating, deleting, and initializing),  undergoes a substantial refactor at 11:49:07 AM.  The original slice is replaced with a simpler slice (`customerFormSlice`), focusing on managing customer details and GST locations within a single Redux state.  The new slice uses `Partial<CustomerFormValues>` for customer details, allowing for partial updates, and uses a more concise reducer structure.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`**: This component is responsible for rendering the customer details form.  Several updates to this component were made between 11:32:27 AM and 12:09:05 PM. The initial versions made API calls to save GST locations and used Redux actions to update the store after a successful backend save.  The final version (12:09:05 PM) uses a simplified approach. It directly dispatches `addGST` or `updateGST` Redux actions upon form submission, streamlining the update process within the Redux store.  The form now handles both adding new and updating existing GST locations using the Redux actions, eliminating the direct manipulation of the Redux store in the component. The component consistently fetches customer details using `useGetCustomerDetailsQuery` and updates the UI accordingly. The component also uses `formik` for form management and includes various input components (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `AutocompleteBox`).


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`**: This file, managing the Redux store, is updated at 11:33:26 AM and 11:49:28 AM. The changes reflect the renaming of `customerGstLocationSlice` to `customerFormSlice` in the reducer to align with the changes in `customerGstLocationSlice.ts`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\GstCustomerLocation.tsx`**: This component, responsible for displaying and managing the list of customer GST locations, is updated multiple times between 11:35:32 AM and 11:59:23 AM.  Early versions utilize Redux selectors for managing the state, initializing data on mount using `useEffect`, and includes functionality for adding, deleting, and editing GST locations. There's a significant simplification in later versions, removing unnecessary complexity and relying more heavily on the centralized Redux store managed by the `customerFormSlice`.  The `formik` library usage is removed in favor of direct Redux actions for better state management.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\customer\CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`**: This page's code is modified at 11:36:21 AM and 11:39:07 AM. The changes primarily focus on streamlining the initial state of customer data and how it is passed to the `CustomerDetailsForm` component. The initial state is simplified; passing of location state is also refined, making the data flow cleaner.

In summary, the development log reflects a refactoring effort to simplify the application's architecture by centralizing GST location management within the Redux store and using Redux actions for all data manipulations instead of direct API calls within components. This reduces complexity and improves maintainability.  The primary changes occur around midday on September 5th, 2025.


## 2:53:32 PM
The codebase update on September 5th, 2025, at approximately 2:51 PM involved modifications to the customer data model and its associated services.

The `customer.ts` file (2:51:31 PM) underwent a significant revision, adding numerous interface definitions related to customer data.  These interfaces (`CustomerQueryType`, `CustomerPayloadTypes`, `CustomerRequestBodyType`, `keyPersonalDetails`, `AlertMappingDetails`, `CreditControlDetails`, `FacDetails`, `UploadDocument`, `CustomerGstLocation`, `GstLocationBodyType`, `GstLocationPayload`)  structure the data for various aspects of customer information, including personal details, GST location details, alerts, credit controls, and uploaded documents.  A recurring theme is the inclusion of `serial_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields in most interfaces, suggesting a common data structure convention across the system.  Several interfaces are nested within others, particularly within `GstLocationBodyType` and `GstLocationPayload`.  The differences between `CustomerPayloadTypes` and `CustomerRequestBodyType` suggest different levels of detail required for creating vs. retrieving customer records.


The `customerService.ts` file (2:51:50 PM)  contains several functions related to customer management. `getCustomer` retrieves customer data based on various search criteria (search, status, location, customer type, customer ID, date range), and sorting. It uses dynamic SQL queries for flexibility.  `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo` fetches aggregated information for dashboard cards, filtering by date range or frequency.  `saveCustomerDetails` saves basic customer details, generating a unique customer ID. `GetCustomerDetails` retrieves comprehensive customer details including GST locations. Finally, `SaveGstLocation` handles saving GST location information along with associated nested data (keyPersonalDetails, alertMappingDetails). This function also uses batch inserts and the transaction management (BEGIN,COMMIT,ROLLBACK) for database operations, ensuring atomicity.  The `sanitizeRow` and `sanitizeArray` functions are used to convert empty strings to null before inserting into database.  The use of `Promise.all` in `GetCustomerDetails` shows efficient data retrieval by fetching multiple datasets concurrently.
