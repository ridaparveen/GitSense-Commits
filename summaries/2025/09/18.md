# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 11:48:09 AM
The log shows modifications to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx`, a React component responsible for adding and editing line bookings.  The initial version (9/18/2025, 9:48:32 AM) included fields for Line Booking No., Booking Date, POL, POD, Line Name, Remarks, Commodity, and a DynamicEditableTable for equipment details.  The component uses Formik for form management and Redux for state management, dispatching `addList` or `updateList` actions based on the form's action type ("add" or "edit").

Subsequent updates (between 9/18/2025, 9:48:47 AM and 9/18/2025, 11:32:46 AM) progressively added more input fields: "Valid Till", "Buy Rate", and "Customer Name".  There were also several minor code refactoring changes like replacing `<div></div>` with `<div/>` and moving the placement of certain elements.  The most significant change was the addition of a radio group for a "Haz" field (presumably indicating hazardous materials) at around 9/18/2025, 11:23:13 AM. The "Haz" radio group initially had only a "Yes" option but was later updated to include a "No" option.  Additionally the `<Label>` component for "Haz" was improved. The formatting within the "Haz" radio group also changed. Finally some minor formatting and layout changes to the form occurred to improve readability and layout.

The final version of `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` (9/18/2025, 11:32:46 AM onward) shows a more complete form with the added fields and a refined radio group for "Haz".  The component's core functionality of adding and updating line bookings through Redux remains consistent throughout the updates.

A separate file, `vesselDataApi.ts`, defines API endpoints for fetching and saving vessel data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. This file was updated only once (9/17/2025, 6:17:02 PM) and didn't change after this timestamp. It provides methods for fetching vessel dashboard data, saving vessels, fetching vessel details, and getting vessel card data.  All endpoints use `getAppHeaders()` for consistent headers.

`LineBookingForm.tsx` (updated 9/18/2025, 11:39:30 AM and 9/18/2025, 11:45:53 AM) manages the display and submission of line booking data.  It uses `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` from `lineBookingApi` for persistence, showing a spinner during submission.  The significant change here involved correcting the `valid_till` field display in the table.


## 12:48:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` component and related files between 11:49 AM and 12:47 PM on September 18, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is on the `AddLineBookingForm` component, which is a React form for adding or editing line bookings.

**AddLineBookingForm.tsx:**

* **11:49 AM:** Initial version of the component. It uses Formik for form handling, includes input fields for various booking details (line booking number, booking date, POL, POD, line name, remarks, commodity, and equipments), and uses an AutocompleteSearch component for POL, POD, Line Name and Customer Name fields.  The form submits data using Redux actions `addList` and `updateList`.  The "haz" field is implemented as a RadioGroup using `@components/kit/radio`.

* **12:02 PM:** The `RadioGroup` component for the "haz" field is updated to use `@headlessui/react` instead of `@components/kit/radio`.  This is a minor library change.

* **12:08 PM - 12:16 PM:** Several minor revisions to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx`.  These revisions primarily involve refinements to the "haz" RadioGroup.  The  `name` attribute of RadioGroup is changed to `haz`.  The `value` attribute of RadioGroup is adjusted to correctly reflect the selected value ("Yes" or "No").  The `onChange` handler is modified to properly update the formik `haz` field.  The `valid_till` input's name is corrected from `valid_till ` to `valid_till`. The `buy_rate` input's name is corrected from `buy_rate ` to `buy_rate`.  There are also several commented-out lines added.

* **12:46 PM - 12:47 PM:**  A `console.log` statement is added to the `onSubmit` function of the `useFormik` hook to print the submitted values.


**LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx:**

* **12:35 PM - 12:44 PM:** This component fetches line booking details using `useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery`. The `useEffect` hook updates the `lineBookingData` state with fetched data.  The key change here is the addition of handling the `haz` field in the mapped data. Initially it was not consistently converted to string "Yes"/"No", which is corrected in subsequent commits.

* **12:44 PM - 12:44 PM:**  A minor correction: the `haz` field's mapping correctly sets "Yes" or "No" based on the boolean value retrieved from the API.

**LineBookingForm.tsx:**

* **12:45 PM:** This component renders a table of line bookings, allowing users to add, edit, and delete entries. It uses Redux for state management, and the `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` hooks from the API for saving and updating data.  Includes the addition of modal and  `EquipmentPopup` for viewing Equipment data.  A helper function `getChangedOrNewBookings` is added to optimize update logic.

In summary, the changes reflect iterative development of a React form for managing line bookings. The initial version was functional, followed by several refinements and bug fixes related to the "haz" field's handling, data mapping, and optimization of update logic. The addition of the `LineBookingForm` component signifies a shift towards a more modular and maintainable code structure.  The `LineBookingDetailsPage` is responsible for fetching and displaying the initial data.
