# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 11:48:09 AM
The log shows modifications to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx`, a React component responsible for adding and editing line bookings.  The initial version (9/18/2025, 9:48:32 AM) included fields for Line Booking No., Booking Date, POL, POD, Line Name, Remarks, Commodity, and a DynamicEditableTable for equipment details.  The component uses Formik for form management and Redux for state management, dispatching `addList` or `updateList` actions based on the form's action type ("add" or "edit").

Subsequent updates (between 9/18/2025, 9:48:47 AM and 9/18/2025, 11:32:46 AM) progressively added more input fields: "Valid Till", "Buy Rate", and "Customer Name".  There were also several minor code refactoring changes like replacing `<div></div>` with `<div/>` and moving the placement of certain elements.  The most significant change was the addition of a radio group for a "Haz" field (presumably indicating hazardous materials) at around 9/18/2025, 11:23:13 AM. The "Haz" radio group initially had only a "Yes" option but was later updated to include a "No" option.  Additionally the `<Label>` component for "Haz" was improved. The formatting within the "Haz" radio group also changed. Finally some minor formatting and layout changes to the form occurred to improve readability and layout.

The final version of `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` (9/18/2025, 11:32:46 AM onward) shows a more complete form with the added fields and a refined radio group for "Haz".  The component's core functionality of adding and updating line bookings through Redux remains consistent throughout the updates.

A separate file, `vesselDataApi.ts`, defines API endpoints for fetching and saving vessel data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. This file was updated only once (9/17/2025, 6:17:02 PM) and didn't change after this timestamp. It provides methods for fetching vessel dashboard data, saving vessels, fetching vessel details, and getting vessel card data.  All endpoints use `getAppHeaders()` for consistent headers.

`LineBookingForm.tsx` (updated 9/18/2025, 11:39:30 AM and 9/18/2025, 11:45:53 AM) manages the display and submission of line booking data.  It uses `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` from `lineBookingApi` for persistence, showing a spinner during submission.  The significant change here involved correcting the `valid_till` field display in the table.
