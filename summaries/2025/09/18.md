# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 11:48:09 AM
The log shows modifications to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx`, a React component responsible for adding and editing line bookings.  The initial version (9/18/2025, 9:48:32 AM) included fields for Line Booking No., Booking Date, POL, POD, Line Name, Remarks, Commodity, and a DynamicEditableTable for equipment details.  The component uses Formik for form management and Redux for state management, dispatching `addList` or `updateList` actions based on the form's action type ("add" or "edit").

Subsequent updates (between 9/18/2025, 9:48:47 AM and 9/18/2025, 11:32:46 AM) progressively added more input fields: "Valid Till", "Buy Rate", and "Customer Name".  There were also several minor code refactoring changes like replacing `<div></div>` with `<div/>` and moving the placement of certain elements.  The most significant change was the addition of a radio group for a "Haz" field (presumably indicating hazardous materials) at around 9/18/2025, 11:23:13 AM. The "Haz" radio group initially had only a "Yes" option but was later updated to include a "No" option.  Additionally the `<Label>` component for "Haz" was improved. The formatting within the "Haz" radio group also changed. Finally some minor formatting and layout changes to the form occurred to improve readability and layout.

The final version of `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` (9/18/2025, 11:32:46 AM onward) shows a more complete form with the added fields and a refined radio group for "Haz".  The component's core functionality of adding and updating line bookings through Redux remains consistent throughout the updates.

A separate file, `vesselDataApi.ts`, defines API endpoints for fetching and saving vessel data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. This file was updated only once (9/17/2025, 6:17:02 PM) and didn't change after this timestamp. It provides methods for fetching vessel dashboard data, saving vessels, fetching vessel details, and getting vessel card data.  All endpoints use `getAppHeaders()` for consistent headers.

`LineBookingForm.tsx` (updated 9/18/2025, 11:39:30 AM and 9/18/2025, 11:45:53 AM) manages the display and submission of line booking data.  It uses `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` from `lineBookingApi` for persistence, showing a spinner during submission.  The significant change here involved correcting the `valid_till` field display in the table.


## 12:48:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` component and related files between 11:49 AM and 12:47 PM on September 18, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is on the `AddLineBookingForm` component, which is a React form for adding or editing line bookings.

**AddLineBookingForm.tsx:**

* **11:49 AM:** Initial version of the component. It uses Formik for form handling, includes input fields for various booking details (line booking number, booking date, POL, POD, line name, remarks, commodity, and equipments), and uses an AutocompleteSearch component for POL, POD, Line Name and Customer Name fields.  The form submits data using Redux actions `addList` and `updateList`.  The "haz" field is implemented as a RadioGroup using `@components/kit/radio`.

* **12:02 PM:** The `RadioGroup` component for the "haz" field is updated to use `@headlessui/react` instead of `@components/kit/radio`.  This is a minor library change.

* **12:08 PM - 12:16 PM:** Several minor revisions to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx`.  These revisions primarily involve refinements to the "haz" RadioGroup.  The  `name` attribute of RadioGroup is changed to `haz`.  The `value` attribute of RadioGroup is adjusted to correctly reflect the selected value ("Yes" or "No").  The `onChange` handler is modified to properly update the formik `haz` field.  The `valid_till` input's name is corrected from `valid_till ` to `valid_till`. The `buy_rate` input's name is corrected from `buy_rate ` to `buy_rate`.  There are also several commented-out lines added.

* **12:46 PM - 12:47 PM:**  A `console.log` statement is added to the `onSubmit` function of the `useFormik` hook to print the submitted values.


**LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx:**

* **12:35 PM - 12:44 PM:** This component fetches line booking details using `useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery`. The `useEffect` hook updates the `lineBookingData` state with fetched data.  The key change here is the addition of handling the `haz` field in the mapped data. Initially it was not consistently converted to string "Yes"/"No", which is corrected in subsequent commits.

* **12:44 PM - 12:44 PM:**  A minor correction: the `haz` field's mapping correctly sets "Yes" or "No" based on the boolean value retrieved from the API.

**LineBookingForm.tsx:**

* **12:45 PM:** This component renders a table of line bookings, allowing users to add, edit, and delete entries. It uses Redux for state management, and the `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` hooks from the API for saving and updating data.  Includes the addition of modal and  `EquipmentPopup` for viewing Equipment data.  A helper function `getChangedOrNewBookings` is added to optimize update logic.

In summary, the changes reflect iterative development of a React form for managing line bookings. The initial version was functional, followed by several refinements and bug fixes related to the "haz" field's handling, data mapping, and optimization of update logic. The addition of the `LineBookingForm` component signifies a shift towards a more modular and maintainable code structure.  The `LineBookingDetailsPage` is responsible for fetching and displaying the initial data.


## 1:48:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to line booking management within a React application.  The most significant changes occur in `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` underwent several revisions between 12:53 PM and 1:09 PM.  These revisions primarily focused on refinements to the form's data handling and submission logic.  Specifically, the `onSubmit` function was adjusted multiple times to improve how data is prepared before dispatching it via Redux (`addList` and `updateList`).  There was also a minor correction in the `haz` RadioGroup's `onChange` handler to ensure proper boolean conversion. The `booking_date` field was updated to use `appDateFormat` function to format the date before submission.


`LineBookingForm.tsx`  was updated at 12:58 PM and 1:02 PM.  The primary change involved enhancing the form's submission handling with error handling and using `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` to interact with an API for saving and updating line bookings. The addition of a loading spinner during submission is also notable.  A minor update at 1:02 PM involved changing how the `haz` field is displayed in the table to handle null or undefined values.

`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` saw updates between 1:10 PM and 1:17 PM. The updates centered around refining how fetched line booking details are mapped and formatted before being passed to `LineBookingForm`. Specifically, the `booking_date` and `valid_till` fields were updated to use the `appDateFormat` function to ensure correct formatting.


`data\coulms\line-booking-columns.tsx` was modified between 1:36 PM and 1:46 PM. The changes made were mostly focused on the `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` constant, adjusting the display of the status badge, adding logging statements, and a conditional rendering based on the customer name. The core functionality and structure remained the same.  These changes suggest improvements to the presentation and logging within the line booking dashboard.

Across all files, there is consistent use of Formik for form handling, Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation.  The repeated updates to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` indicate iterative development and debugging of the form's logic and data handling.  The changes in `LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` highlight a focus on improving data presentation and consistency. The updates to `data\coulms\line-booking-columns.tsx` indicate work on refining UI and UX elements.


## 3:19:54 PM
The `linebookingService.ts` file underwent multiple revisions on September 18th, 2025, primarily focusing on the `create` and `update` functions.  These functions interact with a database, managing line bookings and their associated equipment.

The initial revisions at 12:56 PM and 12:57 PM show the initial implementation of the `create` and `update` functions.  These functions handle the creation and update of line bookings in the `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables.  The `create` function includes a check for the existence of line booking numbers to prevent duplicates.  Both functions use transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).

A revision at 1:14 PM appears to be an attempt to add duplicate checking within the update function, but this was quickly reverted.

The revision at 1:18 PM removed some console logging statements, improving code cleanliness.

The revision at 1:33 PM introduced a conditional assignment of the booking status (`LineBookingStatus.ASSIGNED` or `LineBookingStatus.NEW`) based on the presence of a customer name.

The next few revisions (1:37 PM, 1:46 PM, 1:50 PM) involved minor tweaks, including reverting the conditional status assignment to its previous form, and removing commented-out code from the `create` and `update` functions. A notable change at 1:50 PM sets the status to `LineBookingStatus.ASSIGNED` if `booking.customer_name` exists, otherwise `LineBookingStatus.NEW`.

At 1:58 PM and 1:59 PM and 2:00 PM, the duplicate checking in the `create` function was commented out.  The same happened for the `update` function in revisions at 2:01 PM, 2:03 PM, and 2:07 PM, suggesting a decision to remove or handle duplicate booking numbers differently.

Finally, at 2:08 PM, the commented-out duplicate check in the `create` function remains, and the commented-out code in `update` has also been removed.

Throughout all revisions, the core functionality of creating, updating, retrieving, and retrieving by `vessel_voyage_id` remained consistent. The primary changes revolved around error handling (using try-catch blocks and rollback),  status assignment based on customer name and the removal of duplicate checks.  The `getAll` function consistently uses a `QueryBuilder` for database interaction and offers flexible filtering and pagination.


## 3:19:55 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `line-booking-columns.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`.  The changes span approximately an hour on September 18th, 2025.

`line-booking-columns.tsx` underwent three revisions. The primary changes involved the `renderCell` function within the `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` constant. Initially, there was a conditional rendering of a `Tooltip` component for the "Assigned" status. Subsequent updates refined this conditional rendering with an `else` block for better clarity and removed unnecessary `console.log` statements for improved code efficiency.  No functional changes are apparent in the `TABLE_COLUMN` and `PLANNED_VESSEL_VOYAGE` constants across revisions.

`LineBookingForm.tsx` was modified twice within a short timeframe.  The most significant change was in the `onSubmit` function within the `useFormik` hook. The error handling was adjusted:  The original code logged `error?.data?.message`, while the updated version logs `error?.data?.data`. This suggests a potential alteration in the API response structure or error handling strategy.  No other major structural changes are visible in this file.  Both revisions show extensive use of React components, Redux for state management, and Formik for form handling.  The code includes functionality for adding, editing, and deleting line bookings, along with displaying data in a table format.  The use of `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages is evident.


## 4:19:40 PM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\optionService.ts`,  both made on September 18th, 2025.  The changes are minor and occur within the `normalizeOption` function.

The first revision (3:22:32 PM) uses a '+' character as a separator in the `vessel-voyage` endpoint's value and label construction.

The second revision (3:22:48 PM), made just 16 seconds later, is nearly identical, but it replaces the '+' character with a '/' character in the `vessel-voyage` endpoint's value and label construction.  The `port-data` endpoint's value construction also changes from using '/' to '~' as the separator in  `${item.pol}~${item.pol_code}` and `${item.pod}~${item.pod_code}`.  All other parts of the file remain unchanged.  The updates suggest a quick correction or refinement of the string concatenation within the `normalizeOption` function related to how values and labels are generated for different endpoints.


## 4:19:52 PM
The codebase underwent significant changes related to vessel and voyage management between 3:24 PM and 4:18 PM on September 18, 2025.  The modifications primarily focused on the `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` file, with several updates to its functionality and associated data structures.


`vesselAndVoyageRoutes.ts`: This file was updated multiple times. Initially, it defined routes for fetching vessel data, saving vessels, and retrieving dashboard information.  Later updates altered the route for creating a vessel and voyage to `Paths.Voyage.CreateVesselAndVoyage` and imported the `CreateVesselAndVoyage` function from `vesselAndVoyageService.ts`.


`index.ts`: This file, updated once, registers API routes, including those for authentication, master data, line bookings, customer bookings, document uploads, autocompletion, vessels, and vessel and voyage management. The addition of routes for vessel and voyage management indicates a new feature addition.


`vesselAndVoyageService.ts`: This file saw the most substantial changes throughout the log.  It includes a `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class designed for constructing complex database queries with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities.  The initial version of the file contained functions for retrieving all voyages.  Subsequent updates introduced a new `CreateVesselAndVoyage` function for creating new voyage entries in the database.  Further changes involved refining the database query parameters and improving the date handling.  The `getAll` function was modified to fetch voyage details and associated routing information from the database, updating its response structure to include a `vesselVoyage` field containing the fetched voyage data and a `routingList` to hold the routing information. This function also involved multiple corrections in database queries and data type management.  The most significant change involved adding a new function, `CreateVesselAndVoyage`, to handle the creation of both vessel and voyage data, which included database transaction management (using BEGIN and COMMIT/ROLLBACK).  The function was updated to correct the type of data received and sent.


`models/common/enum.ts`:  This file was updated once, adding or modifying various enums related to user status, role types, menu status, permission names, and entry modes (add/update), and line booking statuses.  This is likely a maintenance update to keep the Enum up-to-date.


`models/common/types/voyage.type.ts`: This file saw multiple updates refining the interface for `GetVoyageParams` and introducing/modifying interfaces: `RoutingList`, `GetVoyagePayload` and `GetVesselAndVoyagePayload`. The changes reflect a shift towards more comprehensive data handling for voyages, including the addition of fields for Port Cut-off, Stuffing Cut-off, and VGM Cut-off in `GetVoyagePayload`, and correcting data types of fields. The structure was modified to more properly handle the response from the database queries.


The overall pattern of changes indicates the development of a new feature for creating and managing vessel and voyage information within the application.  The repeated edits to `vesselAndVoyageService.ts` and `models/common/types/voyage.type.ts` suggest iterative refinement of the implementation. The use of a `QueryBuilder` class points to a structured approach to database interactions.
