# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 12:29:05 AM
The log shows modifications to the frontend code of an application managing line bookings.  The changes span `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` files, primarily focusing on Redux state management and form handling.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` Updates:**

* **Initial State (Multiple Revisions):** The `initialState`  evolves, initially including `vessel_voyage_id` and `line_bookings`, then simplifying to only `line_bookings`, and finally reverting to include `vessel_voyage_id` again. The type of `vessel_voyage_id` changes from `string | null` to `string | number | null`.
* **`addList` Reducer:**  The auto-generated `serial_id` assignment changes from using `Date.now()` to a sequential integer (1, 2, 3...).  Crucially, `vessel_voyage_id` is added to each new booking.
* **`updateList` Reducer:**  Similar to `addList`, it now ensures `vessel_voyage_id` remains consistent after updates.
* **`removeList` Reducer:**  This reducer gains re-indexing of `serial_id` to maintain the sequence after a line booking is removed.
* **`setLineBookings` Reducer:**  The reducer is modified to handle both `line_bookings` and `vessel_voyage_id` updates while normalizing the `serial_id` sequence and attaching the `vessel_voyage_id`.
* **`setVesselVoyageId` Reducer:** A new reducer is added to update `vessel_voyage_id` and propagate it to all existing line bookings in the Redux store.  This ensures consistency across the application.  This appears in the final version of `lineBookingSlice.ts`.


**`LineBookingForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **Initial Values and Form Handling (Multiple Revisions):** Multiple revisions demonstrate adjustments to how initial values are fetched and used in the formik form. The `useEffect` hook is added to populate the Redux store from `initialValues` if the form is in edit mode (`formAction === "edit"`).  The condition for using this `useEffect` is tightened to only trigger when `initialValues.line_bookings` has a length, making it more targeted.
* **`onSubmit` Handler:**  The `onSubmit` handler is updated to use `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` for persisting changes via an API. The `vessel_voyage_id` is consistently included in these API calls. The code was initially missing the `vessel_voyage_id`  in the update and was later corrected.
* **`handleAddMore` Function:** This function initially included a conditional dispatch to update `vessel_voyage_id` in the Redux store.  This is later removed, suggesting the state update may be handled elsewhere now.
* **Table Data Source:** The source of the table data (`tableData`) becomes dependent on whether the form is in "edit" or "add" mode.
* **Added `formAction` to State:** The `formAction` is added to the state passed to `AddLineBookingForm`, which allows the edit mode to be handled appropriately. This was likely added to address differences between "Add" and "Edit" forms.
* **`tableData` Source Change:** The final version of this file displays the `line_bookings` from the Redux store.  The `map` used to render the table rows is changed to iterate over `line_bookings` instead of `formik.values.line_bookings` in the final commit.


**Significant Timestamps:**

* **11:37:16 PM 9/11/2025:** Significant changes to `lineBookingSlice.ts`, streamlining the reducers and auto-incrementing `serial_id`.
* **11:49:56 PM 9/11/2025 and later:**  Subsequent changes to both files focused on integrating API calls and refining Redux interactions. The final revisions appear between 12:00 AM and 12:26 AM on 9/12/2025, specifically adding `setVesselVoyageId` action and refactoring how vessel_voyage_id is handled.


**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`) for state management.
* Reliance on Formik (`formik`) for form handling.
* Extensive use of React components.
* The `vessel_voyage_id` is consistently handled and maintained throughout the code, both in the Redux slice and the form data.
* Serial IDs are managed for uniqueness and sequential ordering within the Redux store.

The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement of the line booking management system, improving data integrity, and streamlining interaction between the form and the Redux store.  The changes primarily focus on correcting how `vessel_voyage_id` was handled, ensuring consistent values in the Redux store and API calls.


## 10:46:53 AM
The `linebookingService.ts` file was updated on 9/12/2025, 10:01:01 AM.  The update involved modifications to several functions dealing with line booking management in a database.

Key changes include:

* **`create` function:** This function handles the creation of new line bookings. It inserts data into `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables.  It uses transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency.

* **`getAll` function:** This function retrieves all line bookings, allowing for pagination and filtering by `line_booking_no`. It joins data from `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables.  It includes logging of the executed query.

* **`getByVesselVoyageId` function:** This function retrieves line bookings based on `vessel_voyage_id`. Similar to `getAll`, it joins data from both tables.

* **`update` function:** This function updates existing line bookings. It uses transactions and first deletes entries from `line_booking_equipments` before inserting updated equipment details.

* **`confirmLineBooking` function:** This function confirms a line booking, updating its status, adding a `do_number`, and saving associated documents using a `saveDoc` function.  Transaction management is used.

* **`changeStatus` function:**  This function allows changing the status of a line booking.  Currently, only `CANCELLED` status is allowed.


Recurring elements include:

* Extensive use of parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Consistent use of transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.
*  Error handling with HTTP status codes and JSON responses.
*  Frequent use of `query` and `insertQuery` functions for database interaction.
*  Joining data from `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables in several functions.  The structure of data handling (fetching and displaying bookings along with their related equipment details) is consistent throughout the code.

The code demonstrates a well-structured approach to database interaction and error handling within a RESTful API context.  The use of a QueryBuilder class in the `getAll` function suggests an attempt at cleaner code structure for query construction.


## 10:47:02 AM
The log shows modifications to frontend code related to line booking functionality.  The primary files involved are `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`, with several commits to the latter.  `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `line-booking-columns.tsx` were also updated.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\lineBookingSlice.ts`**: This Redux slice manages line booking data.  Two commits (12:30:05 AM and 12:33:49 AM) show minor changes. The second commit simplifies the `line_bookings` type in the `LineBookingState` interface from `LineBooking[]` to `any[]`.  The core functionality of adding, updating, removing, and resetting line bookings remains consistent.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\line-booking\LineBookingForm.tsx`**: This component displays and handles line booking information. Multiple commits (12:35:02 AM, 12:39:20 AM, 12:42:47 AM, 12:42:53 AM, 12:43:17 AM, 12:50:24 AM, 12:51:14 AM, 12:53:24 AM) reveal iterative development. Changes include:

* Initial implementation of the form, including adding and editing functionalities using `formik`, Redux actions (`setLineBookings`, `setVesselVoyageId`), and API calls (`useSaveLineBookingMutation`, `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`).
*  Enhancements to data handling based on form actions ("add" or "edit").
*   Refactoring the `handleAddMore` function.
* Removal of unnecessary commented-out code.
* Passing `vessel_voyage_id` in navigation to `/app/export/line_booking/add_line_booking`.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\line-booking\AddLineBookingForm.tsx`**: This component is for adding new or editing existing line bookings.  It uses `formik` for form management, `DynamicEditableTable` for handling equipment details, and Redux actions (`addList`, `updateList`) to update the store.  A key change (12:53:37 AM) removes unnecessary commented-out code and simplifies navigation state.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\line-booking-columns.tsx`**: This file defines column configurations for tables and grids related to line bookings.  Several commits (9:52:46 AM, 9:53:03 AM, 9:53:17 AM, 9:54:01 AM, 9:59:10 AM, 10:01:57 AM, 10:02:48 AM) demonstrate refinements to the column definitions, especially in the `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` constant. The most significant change involved renaming a column from "View" to "Equipments" and modifying the button in the `renderCell` to trigger a state update (`setOpen`) to open an equipment details modal.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\line-booking\EquipmentPopup.tsx`**: A placeholder component for an equipment popup is added (9:54:31 AM).


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\line-booking\LineBookingDashboard.tsx`**: This component renders the Line Booking dashboard. Changes include the integration of a search bar, filter sidebar, sorting functionality, and an Excel export feature using Lodash's `debounce` for optimized searching. It also uses a custom grid component (`AppGrid`) and incorporates modals for confirmation, cancellation, and viewing equipment details.  The fetching of LineBooking data from the api is also incorporated.  The `EquipmentPopup` component is called from this file.


The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement of the UI and data handling for the line booking feature. The frequent commits to `LineBookingForm.tsx` suggest an iterative development approach.  The updates to `line-booking-columns.tsx` indicate ongoing adjustments to the presentation of data in tables and grids.


## 11:47:00 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the Envosys frontend codebase on September 12th, 2025, primarily focused on the line booking and customer booking features.

`line-booking-columns.tsx`: This file, updated multiple times (11:00:56 AM, 11:06:34 AM), defines columns for data grids related to line bookings.  The updates involve adjustments to column definitions, including additions, removals, and modifications of rendering logic using components like `TMenu` and `Badge`.  The `TABLE_COLUMN` constant, defining columns for an editable table within the line booking form, remains largely unchanged.


`LineBookingDashboard.tsx`: Updated at 11:01:07 AM and 11:02:28 AM, this component renders the main dashboard for line bookings.  The most significant changes are the integration of a backend API (`useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery`) to fetch data and a removal of the `EquipmentPopup` component.  The component utilizes filtering, sorting, and export functionality (Excel generation).

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`:  This component, updated twice (11:01:55 AM, 11:02:02 AM), handles adding and editing line bookings.  It uses Formik for form management and Redux for data persistence (`addList`, `updateList`). No significant functional changes are seen between the two updates.


`LineBookingForm.tsx`: Updated multiple times (11:04:26 AM, 11:06:21 AM), this component manages the display and submission of line booking data. The updates primarily refine the data handling and display within a table, improving rendering of equipment details and correcting spelling errors.  The `onSubmit` function now uses API mutations (`useSaveLineBookingMutation`, `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`) for saving and updating data, which was lacking in the initial commit.

`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx`: Updated at 11:06:47 AM, this page displays and allows editing of line booking details. It fetches data using `useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery` and uses `LineBookingForm` for the form.


`lineBookingSlice.ts`: Updated at 11:07:22 AM, this Redux slice manages the state of line bookings, including actions for adding, updating, removing, and resetting line booking data.


`menu.ts`: This file, updated twice (11:17:48 AM, 11:20:12 AM, 11:20:30 AM), defines the sidebar menu structure for the application.  The key change between updates was the addition of a "Customer Booking" menu item under the "Export" section, and its respective href and icon.  The `customer_booking` entry was added to `iconMap`.

`App.tsx`: Updated twice (11:20:54 AM, 11:21:38 AM) to reflect the newly added Customer Booking page and route.


`CustomerBookingPage.tsx`: This file underwent several updates (11:21:29 AM, 11:23:24 AM, 11:24:02 AM, 11:26:19 AM) evolving from a simple placeholder to a page containing a `CustomerBookingDashboard`.


`CustomerBookingDashboard.tsx`:  This component, updated multiple times (11:25:55 AM, 11:34:00 AM, 11:41:44 AM),  is responsible for displaying a dashboard for customer bookings. The updates involved adding filtering, sorting, searching and excel export functionality, similar to the Line Booking dashboard.  The component now retrieves data using `useGetCustomerDashboardDataQuery` and utilizes Redux for state management (`customerDashboardSetFilters`, `customerDashboardSetPagination`).

`customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`: This file, updated several times (11:37:18 AM, 11:40:13 AM, 11:42:27 AM, 11:43:50 AM), defines columns for customer dashboards.  The major changes include the addition of `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` providing a new column configuration specifically for customer booking.  Significant changes to column names and data fields were introduced to align with the customer booking data structure. The addition of the "Equipments" column and the rendering of the "View" button in the `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` constant demonstrates a substantial refactoring.

`action.tsx`: Updated at 11:41:19 AM, this file contains functions to generate menu actions for customers, reflecting the additions to the customer dashboard functionality.


In summary, the code changes reflect a substantial development effort centered around the implementation of customer booking features, which mirrors, and extends, the already-existing line booking functionality, including robust filtering, sorting, exporting, and data management using Redux and API calls.  The addition of a dedicated Customer Booking page and the associated components highlights the major focus of this update cycle.


## 12:46:59 PM
The provided log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerBookingService.ts`.  Both entries contain identical code.  The only difference is the timestamp, indicating that the file was saved twice within a short time frame (9/12/2025, 12:19:46 PM and 9/12/2025, 12:27:33 PM).  The code itself defines two functions within a service:

* `getNewBookingId`: This function generates a new booking ID using `generateBookingId()`, logs the creation, and returns the ID to the client.  Error handling is included.

* `getAll`: This function retrieves all customer bookings based on various filters (page, perPage, line_booking_no, customer_booking_no). It uses a `QueryBuilder` to construct a SQL query, fetches data, and includes pagination information in the response.  It also retrieves associated equipment information for each booking.  Robust error handling is implemented with logging.  The code handles the fetching and presentation of related equipment data for each booking, transforming the `ASSIGNED` status to `ALLOTTED`.


No significant changes occurred between the two recorded versions; they appear to be identical saves of the same code.


## 12:47:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `envosys-frontend` application, primarily focusing on the `CustomerBookingDashboard` component and its related `customer-dashboard-columns` data.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer-booking\CustomerBookingDashboard.tsx`**: This file underwent several modifications between 11:47 AM and 12:46 PM on September 12, 2025.  The changes involved:

* **11:47 AM - 11:48 AM:**  A minor change in the `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` function call, replacing `setOpen` with `setModal`. This suggests a refactoring to better manage modal state.
* **11:48 AM - 11:50 AM:**  The `EquipmentPopup` component was added as an import and integrated into the `BaseModal`. This introduced a new popup to display equipment details.
* **11:50 AM - 12:14 PM:** The primary change here involved switching the data source for the Customer Booking Dashboard.  Initially, it used `useGetCustomerDashboardDataQuery` from `"store/api/customerDataApi"`, then it was changed to `useFetccustomerBookingDashboardDataQuery` from `"store/api/customerBookingApi"`.  This indicates a shift from fetching customer data directly to retrieving customer booking data.
* **12:14 PM - 12:46 PM:** Minor corrections were made to console logging statements, improving code readability.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`**: This file was updated between 11:50 AM and 12:46 PM. The changes centered around refining the `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` constant:

* **11:50 AM - 11:51 AM:** The `EquipmentPopup` modal opening logic is updated for better functionality within the table rendering of equipments
* **12:11 PM - 12:46 PM:**  Significant changes to column definitions. The `customer_id` field was renamed to `line_booking_no`, and new fields (`vessel_voyage_id`, `customer_booking_no`, `transportation`) were added, reflecting a change in the data structure from a customer focus to a line booking focus.   A `console.log` statement was added within the `renderCell` function for the 'equipment' column for debugging purposes.  The `other` column name was changed to `transportation`.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\line-booking\EquipmentPopup.tsx`**: This file experienced extensive revisions between 11:55 AM and 12:10 PM.  Initially, it was a stub component with placeholder content. Subsequently:

* **11:55 AM - 12:02 PM:** The component was fleshed out, utilizing `useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery` from `"store/api/lineBookingApi"` to fetch and display equipment data in a table. Multiple iterations involved correcting the data access path within the `lineBookingDashboardData` object.
* **12:10 PM - 12:10 PM:** A minor change where the data access path for `lineBookingDashboardData` was simplified, removing unnecessary nesting.



**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`**: This file was updated at 12:15 PM to include `customerBookingApi` in the middleware and reducers. This reflects the integration of the new API for customer bookings into the Redux store.  This is a key change, suggesting a substantial architectural shift within the application.  The `customerBooking` variable was corrected to `customerBookingApi`.


In summary, the code changes represent a significant refactoring of the application to focus on customer booking data rather than just customer data. New API endpoints were created, and components were updated to reflect this change.  There's a clear pattern of iterative development, with several minor corrections and refinements made to the code throughout the log.


## 3:02:06 PM
The `linebookingService.ts` file underwent a significant update on September 12th, 2025, at 1:00:02 PM.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for line bookings within a database.  The code interacts extensively with a PostgreSQL-like database using parameterized queries, ensuring SQL injection prevention. Transactions are managed using `BEGIN` and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` blocks for data consistency.

Specific updates include:

* **`create` function:** This function inserts new line booking records into the `line_booking_master` table and associated equipment details into the `line_booking_equipments` table.  It handles nested equipment data and returns a success or error response.

* **`getAll` function:** This function retrieves all line bookings, allowing for pagination and filtering by `line_booking_no` and `status`.  It efficiently fetches associated equipment data in a single query.  It also logs the executed query using a logger.

* **`getByVesselVoyageId` function:** This function retrieves line bookings based on `vessel_voyage_id`, including associated equipment data.

* **`update` function:** This function updates existing line bookings.  Crucially, it first deletes existing equipment records for the booking before inserting new ones, ensuring data integrity.

* **`confirmLineBooking` function:** This function updates the status of a line booking to "CONFIRMED", adds a DO number, and manages file uploads using a `saveDoc` function (details of this function are not provided).  It uses transactions to ensure atomicity.

* **`changeStatus` function:** This function allows changing the status of a line booking, currently only supporting setting it to `CANCELLED`.

Recurring elements include:

* Consistent use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Robust error handling with HTTP status codes and informative error messages.
* Extensive use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`).
* Logging of crucial information, including queries and errors.
*  Use of transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to maintain data consistency.


The code demonstrates a well-structured approach to database interaction, error handling, and data management within a RESTful API context.  The use of interfaces enhances code readability and maintainability.


## 4:02:01 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application, focusing on customer booking features.  Significant changes occurred between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM on September 12th, 2025.

`actions.tsx`: This file, related to customer booking actions, underwent several revisions. Initially, it featured an `onClick` handler navigating to `/app/master/customer/gst-location`.  Subsequent updates refined the navigation path to `/app/export/customer_booking/update` and added an `icon` property to the `MenuActionItem` interface, integrating a PencilIcon.  Finally, the function was modified to return an empty array if access is denied.


`UpdateBooking.tsx`: A simple component, `UpdateBooking`, was initially created as a placeholder, simply rendering "UpdateBooking".

`App.tsx`: This file, containing the application's routing configuration, was updated to include a route for `/export/customer_booking/update`  mapping to `UpdateCustomerBooking`. This component was added later.


`customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`: This component defines columns for customer dashboards.  It includes columns for customer information and actions, and it was significantly changed throughout the log. The most notable change is the addition of an "Update Booking" action within the `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` using  `getCustomerBookingActions`, and the change in icon for the menu from `EllipsisVerticalIcon` to `PencilIcon`.

`CustomerBookingDashboard.tsx`: This component displays a customer booking dashboard with filtering, sorting, pagination, excel export and a button to add new bookings. It uses data from a Redux store and a custom API.


`UpdateCustomerBooking.tsx`: This component started as a placeholder displaying "UpdateCustomerBooking," then evolved into a more detailed table structure for editing customer booking information.  It uses Formik for form management and AutocompleteSearch for input fields. The component was enhanced to include input fields for various booking details (Container No., Vehicle No., Size, Type, Date/Time fields) using `InputBox` and `AutocompleteSearch` components.


In summary, the log shows the iterative development of a customer booking dashboard and an update form. The development process involved creating placeholders, refining navigation, improving UI elements, adding functionality for adding new bookings, and incorporating form handling with Formik.  The `customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` and `actions.tsx` files are closely linked and show a pattern of iterative improvement and refinement of the UI and data handling.


## 5:02:06 PM
The log shows a series of rapid modifications to the `UpdateCustomerBooking.tsx` component between 4:02 PM and 4:28 PM on September 12, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the UI of a customer booking update form.  The changes involved replacing `AutocompleteSearch` components with `InputBox` components for various fields like "Container No.", "Vehicle No.", "Seal No.",  and date/time inputs for "Empty Yard Pickup," "Factory Gate In/Out," and "CFS Gate In."  Additionally, "Size" and "Type" fields became read-only with default values.  The "Upload Picture" field was initially a simple `<input type="file">`, later improved with a styled button to trigger file selection and some commented-out code for file preview.  The minimum width of several table cells was increased using `min-w-[150px]`.

Between 4:33 PM and 4:51 PM, significant changes were made to `NewCustomerBookingPage.tsx`. This component was enhanced by integrating a data fetching mechanism (`useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery`) from a backend API (`lineBookingApi`).  Initially, the component used dummy data (`PLANNED_SHIPPING_BILLS_DATA`), but it was replaced with fetched data (`customerLineBookingDashboardData?.data`). The `uniqueId` prop in `AppGrid` was changed from `"id"` to `"serial_id"`.  A modal (`BaseModal`) was added to display an `EquipmentPopup` component, triggered by a button in the datagrid.  The `useNavigate` hook was also incorporated to enable navigation to the customer master page using the cancel button.  Finally, `CUSTOMER_NEW_BOOKING_COLUMNS` in `customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` was updated to include a radio button for row selection and to correctly pass data to formik.  The `type` of modal was changed from `view` to `customer-booking-view`.


## 5:02:11 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `searchOptions.ts` and `optionQuery.ts` files between 4:15 PM and 4:39 PM on September 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve enhancing the autocomplete functionality by adding support for new search endpoints.

`optionQuery.ts`:  This file received two significant updates. Initially, at 4:32:05 PM, no changes are mentioned. At 4:39:11 PM, a new function `getCustomerNames()` was added to the `OptionQuery` class. This function constructs a SQL query to fetch customer names based on a keyword search.  The `getGstLocation` function was also modified to remove a join with the `customer` table.


`searchOptions.ts`: This file underwent three updates. The first update at 4:15:55 PM established the basic autocomplete functionality, handling searches for various endpoints including `sales_export`, `sales_import`, `port`, `mention-users`, and `vessel-voyage`.

The second update (4:32:37 PM) added a new entry "name: 'customer-name'" to the `fieldMap` object. This lays the groundwork for the addition of customer name search.  The third update (4:39:56 PM) integrated the new `customer-name` endpoint into the `switch` statement, routing requests to the newly created `getCustomerNames` function in `optionQuery.ts`.  This change made at 4:39:56 PM, completed the addition of customer name search functionality.

In summary, the code evolution involved adding a new search option ("customer-name") to retrieve customer names from the database.  This was achieved by creating a new query in `optionQuery.ts` and updating `searchOptions.ts` to handle this new endpoint.  All queries are limited to 10 results. There's a consistent pattern of using lower-cased keywords and `ILIKE` for case-insensitive searches in the SQL queries.
