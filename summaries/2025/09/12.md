# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 12:29:05 AM
The log shows modifications to the frontend code of an application managing line bookings.  The changes span `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` files, primarily focusing on Redux state management and form handling.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` Updates:**

* **Initial State (Multiple Revisions):** The `initialState`  evolves, initially including `vessel_voyage_id` and `line_bookings`, then simplifying to only `line_bookings`, and finally reverting to include `vessel_voyage_id` again. The type of `vessel_voyage_id` changes from `string | null` to `string | number | null`.
* **`addList` Reducer:**  The auto-generated `serial_id` assignment changes from using `Date.now()` to a sequential integer (1, 2, 3...).  Crucially, `vessel_voyage_id` is added to each new booking.
* **`updateList` Reducer:**  Similar to `addList`, it now ensures `vessel_voyage_id` remains consistent after updates.
* **`removeList` Reducer:**  This reducer gains re-indexing of `serial_id` to maintain the sequence after a line booking is removed.
* **`setLineBookings` Reducer:**  The reducer is modified to handle both `line_bookings` and `vessel_voyage_id` updates while normalizing the `serial_id` sequence and attaching the `vessel_voyage_id`.
* **`setVesselVoyageId` Reducer:** A new reducer is added to update `vessel_voyage_id` and propagate it to all existing line bookings in the Redux store.  This ensures consistency across the application.  This appears in the final version of `lineBookingSlice.ts`.


**`LineBookingForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **Initial Values and Form Handling (Multiple Revisions):** Multiple revisions demonstrate adjustments to how initial values are fetched and used in the formik form. The `useEffect` hook is added to populate the Redux store from `initialValues` if the form is in edit mode (`formAction === "edit"`).  The condition for using this `useEffect` is tightened to only trigger when `initialValues.line_bookings` has a length, making it more targeted.
* **`onSubmit` Handler:**  The `onSubmit` handler is updated to use `useSaveLineBookingMutation` and `useUpdateLineBookingMutation` for persisting changes via an API. The `vessel_voyage_id` is consistently included in these API calls. The code was initially missing the `vessel_voyage_id`  in the update and was later corrected.
* **`handleAddMore` Function:** This function initially included a conditional dispatch to update `vessel_voyage_id` in the Redux store.  This is later removed, suggesting the state update may be handled elsewhere now.
* **Table Data Source:** The source of the table data (`tableData`) becomes dependent on whether the form is in "edit" or "add" mode.
* **Added `formAction` to State:** The `formAction` is added to the state passed to `AddLineBookingForm`, which allows the edit mode to be handled appropriately. This was likely added to address differences between "Add" and "Edit" forms.
* **`tableData` Source Change:** The final version of this file displays the `line_bookings` from the Redux store.  The `map` used to render the table rows is changed to iterate over `line_bookings` instead of `formik.values.line_bookings` in the final commit.


**Significant Timestamps:**

* **11:37:16 PM 9/11/2025:** Significant changes to `lineBookingSlice.ts`, streamlining the reducers and auto-incrementing `serial_id`.
* **11:49:56 PM 9/11/2025 and later:**  Subsequent changes to both files focused on integrating API calls and refining Redux interactions. The final revisions appear between 12:00 AM and 12:26 AM on 9/12/2025, specifically adding `setVesselVoyageId` action and refactoring how vessel_voyage_id is handled.


**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`) for state management.
* Reliance on Formik (`formik`) for form handling.
* Extensive use of React components.
* The `vessel_voyage_id` is consistently handled and maintained throughout the code, both in the Redux slice and the form data.
* Serial IDs are managed for uniqueness and sequential ordering within the Redux store.

The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement of the line booking management system, improving data integrity, and streamlining interaction between the form and the Redux store.  The changes primarily focus on correcting how `vessel_voyage_id` was handled, ensuring consistent values in the Redux store and API calls.


## 10:46:53 AM
The `linebookingService.ts` file was updated on 9/12/2025, 10:01:01 AM.  The update involved modifications to several functions dealing with line booking management in a database.

Key changes include:

* **`create` function:** This function handles the creation of new line bookings. It inserts data into `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables.  It uses transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency.

* **`getAll` function:** This function retrieves all line bookings, allowing for pagination and filtering by `line_booking_no`. It joins data from `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables.  It includes logging of the executed query.

* **`getByVesselVoyageId` function:** This function retrieves line bookings based on `vessel_voyage_id`. Similar to `getAll`, it joins data from both tables.

* **`update` function:** This function updates existing line bookings. It uses transactions and first deletes entries from `line_booking_equipments` before inserting updated equipment details.

* **`confirmLineBooking` function:** This function confirms a line booking, updating its status, adding a `do_number`, and saving associated documents using a `saveDoc` function.  Transaction management is used.

* **`changeStatus` function:**  This function allows changing the status of a line booking.  Currently, only `CANCELLED` status is allowed.


Recurring elements include:

* Extensive use of parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Consistent use of transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.
*  Error handling with HTTP status codes and JSON responses.
*  Frequent use of `query` and `insertQuery` functions for database interaction.
*  Joining data from `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables in several functions.  The structure of data handling (fetching and displaying bookings along with their related equipment details) is consistent throughout the code.

The code demonstrates a well-structured approach to database interaction and error handling within a RESTful API context.  The use of a QueryBuilder class in the `getAll` function suggests an attempt at cleaner code structure for query construction.
