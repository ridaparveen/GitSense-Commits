# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 11:48:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `linebookingService.ts` file and one revision to `linebookingsRoutes.ts`  on September 10th and 11th, 2025.  The majority of changes are within `linebookingService.ts`.

**linebookingService.ts:**

* **Initial Version (7:50 PM):** This version establishes the basic structure of the service, including interfaces for `LineBooking`, `LineBookingEqup`, and `BookingPayload`. It defines four main functions: `create`, `getAll`, `confirmLineBooking`, and `changeStatus`.  The `create` function inserts line bookings and their associated equipment into the database using transaction. The `getAll` function retrieves line bookings with pagination and filtering. `confirmLineBooking` updates the status of a line booking and handles document uploads. `changeStatus` updates the status of a line booking.

* **Subsequent Revisions (7:54 PM, 7:55 PM):** Minor inconsistencies in the `create` function were addressed, specifically in the `vessel_voyage_id` handling.  There is no functional change.

* **Revision (7:57 PM, 7:58 PM):** Error handling improved in the `create` function. Instead of a generic catch-all, the error is now logged specifically with `console.error`.

* **Revision (9:59 PM, 10:00 PM):**  A date formatting function `AppDateFormate` was added to the imports, and its usage was attempted within the `create` function's `insertQuery` for the `booking_date` field. This change was subsequently reverted in the next revision.

* **Revision (10:19 PM, 10:21 PM):** Error handling was improved in `getAll` function by logging the error.

* **Revision (10:25 PM):** The `getAll` function's query builder was refactored to make the `line_booking_no` filter optional and to use a wildcard `%${line_booking_no}%` for LIKE operator. This allows for partial matches when searching for line booking numbers. The default page number is also corrected to 1.

* **Revision (10:53 PM, 10:53 PM):**  The default page number for `getAll` was briefly changed to `0` and corrected back to `1` in the next revision.

* **Revision (11:30 AM, 11:36 AM, 11:37 AM):** A significant change to the `LineBookingEqup` interface occurred.  The fields `size_type` and `count` were replaced with `size`, `type`, `temperature`, `humidity`, and `count`, suggesting an enhancement to track more equipment details. The database insertion query in the `create` function was updated accordingly. In addition, some console logs were added for debugging.

**linebookingsRoutes.ts:**

* **Revision (1:10 AM):** This file defines the Express.js routes for line booking management.  It uses middleware for file uploads (`uploadMiddleware`).  There was a typo in the path ("../docuemnts") corrected in the next revision.


* **Revision (11:29 AM):** The typo in the file upload middleware path was corrected from "../docuemnts" to "../documents".

In summary, the `linebookingService.ts` file underwent several iterations focused on error handling, date formatting (briefly), and a major update to the equipment details captured. The `linebookingsRoutes.ts` file had minor corrections related to file upload middleware. The recurring theme is improving error handling and refining database interactions.


## 3:48:18 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application for line booking management.  Key updates across multiple files center around fetching and displaying line booking data.

`LineBookingDashboard.tsx` (9/11/2025, 2:50:54 PM): This component was significantly updated.  It now features a dashboard displaying line booking data fetched from an API (`useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery`).  The component includes robust filtering, sorting (by booking number, date, and status), searching (with debouncing), pagination, and data export to Excel functionality.  The UI utilizes many custom components and utilizes the `@heroicons/react` and `react-icons/fa6` icon libraries for visual elements.  Initial filters are set to a default date range and completed status.

`lineBookingApi.ts` (9/11/2025, 3:35:34 PM): This file defines API endpoints using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query`.  Endpoints include creating, fetching (dashboard data, details, and card data), confirming, and canceling line bookings.  All endpoints use `getAppHeaders()` for authentication, suggesting secure API calls.  The `cancelLineBooking` mutation uses a GET request, which is unconventional but may be due to specific API requirements.

`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` (9/11/2025, 3:38:51 PM - 9/11/2025, 3:44:20 PM): This component, displaying line booking details, underwent several minor revisions. Initially, it fetched data using `vesselData?.voyageDetails?.serial_id`. This was later corrected to use just `state?.serial_id` to correctly fetch details, improving the component's reliability.  The component renders a `LineBookingForm` for adding or editing line booking information based on the `formAction` state from the navigation.

In summary, the code changes reflect the iterative development of a line booking management system. The updates focus on enhancing the user interface for data presentation and interaction, improving API integration for data management, and refining the data fetching logic within specific components to ensure that data is accurately retrieved.  The consistent use of `getAppHeaders()` points to a centralized authentication system for the application.
