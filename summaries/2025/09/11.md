# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 11:48:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `linebookingService.ts` file and one revision to `linebookingsRoutes.ts`  on September 10th and 11th, 2025.  The majority of changes are within `linebookingService.ts`.

**linebookingService.ts:**

* **Initial Version (7:50 PM):** This version establishes the basic structure of the service, including interfaces for `LineBooking`, `LineBookingEqup`, and `BookingPayload`. It defines four main functions: `create`, `getAll`, `confirmLineBooking`, and `changeStatus`.  The `create` function inserts line bookings and their associated equipment into the database using transaction. The `getAll` function retrieves line bookings with pagination and filtering. `confirmLineBooking` updates the status of a line booking and handles document uploads. `changeStatus` updates the status of a line booking.

* **Subsequent Revisions (7:54 PM, 7:55 PM):** Minor inconsistencies in the `create` function were addressed, specifically in the `vessel_voyage_id` handling.  There is no functional change.

* **Revision (7:57 PM, 7:58 PM):** Error handling improved in the `create` function. Instead of a generic catch-all, the error is now logged specifically with `console.error`.

* **Revision (9:59 PM, 10:00 PM):**  A date formatting function `AppDateFormate` was added to the imports, and its usage was attempted within the `create` function's `insertQuery` for the `booking_date` field. This change was subsequently reverted in the next revision.

* **Revision (10:19 PM, 10:21 PM):** Error handling was improved in `getAll` function by logging the error.

* **Revision (10:25 PM):** The `getAll` function's query builder was refactored to make the `line_booking_no` filter optional and to use a wildcard `%${line_booking_no}%` for LIKE operator. This allows for partial matches when searching for line booking numbers. The default page number is also corrected to 1.

* **Revision (10:53 PM, 10:53 PM):**  The default page number for `getAll` was briefly changed to `0` and corrected back to `1` in the next revision.

* **Revision (11:30 AM, 11:36 AM, 11:37 AM):** A significant change to the `LineBookingEqup` interface occurred.  The fields `size_type` and `count` were replaced with `size`, `type`, `temperature`, `humidity`, and `count`, suggesting an enhancement to track more equipment details. The database insertion query in the `create` function was updated accordingly. In addition, some console logs were added for debugging.

**linebookingsRoutes.ts:**

* **Revision (1:10 AM):** This file defines the Express.js routes for line booking management.  It uses middleware for file uploads (`uploadMiddleware`).  There was a typo in the path ("../docuemnts") corrected in the next revision.


* **Revision (11:29 AM):** The typo in the file upload middleware path was corrected from "../docuemnts" to "../documents".

In summary, the `linebookingService.ts` file underwent several iterations focused on error handling, date formatting (briefly), and a major update to the equipment details captured. The `linebookingsRoutes.ts` file had minor corrections related to file upload middleware. The recurring theme is improving error handling and refining database interactions.
