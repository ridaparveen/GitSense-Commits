# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 11:48:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `linebookingService.ts` file and one revision to `linebookingsRoutes.ts`  on September 10th and 11th, 2025.  The majority of changes are within `linebookingService.ts`.

**linebookingService.ts:**

* **Initial Version (7:50 PM):** This version establishes the basic structure of the service, including interfaces for `LineBooking`, `LineBookingEqup`, and `BookingPayload`. It defines four main functions: `create`, `getAll`, `confirmLineBooking`, and `changeStatus`.  The `create` function inserts line bookings and their associated equipment into the database using transaction. The `getAll` function retrieves line bookings with pagination and filtering. `confirmLineBooking` updates the status of a line booking and handles document uploads. `changeStatus` updates the status of a line booking.

* **Subsequent Revisions (7:54 PM, 7:55 PM):** Minor inconsistencies in the `create` function were addressed, specifically in the `vessel_voyage_id` handling.  There is no functional change.

* **Revision (7:57 PM, 7:58 PM):** Error handling improved in the `create` function. Instead of a generic catch-all, the error is now logged specifically with `console.error`.

* **Revision (9:59 PM, 10:00 PM):**  A date formatting function `AppDateFormate` was added to the imports, and its usage was attempted within the `create` function's `insertQuery` for the `booking_date` field. This change was subsequently reverted in the next revision.

* **Revision (10:19 PM, 10:21 PM):** Error handling was improved in `getAll` function by logging the error.

* **Revision (10:25 PM):** The `getAll` function's query builder was refactored to make the `line_booking_no` filter optional and to use a wildcard `%${line_booking_no}%` for LIKE operator. This allows for partial matches when searching for line booking numbers. The default page number is also corrected to 1.

* **Revision (10:53 PM, 10:53 PM):**  The default page number for `getAll` was briefly changed to `0` and corrected back to `1` in the next revision.

* **Revision (11:30 AM, 11:36 AM, 11:37 AM):** A significant change to the `LineBookingEqup` interface occurred.  The fields `size_type` and `count` were replaced with `size`, `type`, `temperature`, `humidity`, and `count`, suggesting an enhancement to track more equipment details. The database insertion query in the `create` function was updated accordingly. In addition, some console logs were added for debugging.

**linebookingsRoutes.ts:**

* **Revision (1:10 AM):** This file defines the Express.js routes for line booking management.  It uses middleware for file uploads (`uploadMiddleware`).  There was a typo in the path ("../docuemnts") corrected in the next revision.


* **Revision (11:29 AM):** The typo in the file upload middleware path was corrected from "../docuemnts" to "../documents".

In summary, the `linebookingService.ts` file underwent several iterations focused on error handling, date formatting (briefly), and a major update to the equipment details captured. The `linebookingsRoutes.ts` file had minor corrections related to file upload middleware. The recurring theme is improving error handling and refining database interactions.


## 3:48:18 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application for line booking management.  Key updates across multiple files center around fetching and displaying line booking data.

`LineBookingDashboard.tsx` (9/11/2025, 2:50:54 PM): This component was significantly updated.  It now features a dashboard displaying line booking data fetched from an API (`useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery`).  The component includes robust filtering, sorting (by booking number, date, and status), searching (with debouncing), pagination, and data export to Excel functionality.  The UI utilizes many custom components and utilizes the `@heroicons/react` and `react-icons/fa6` icon libraries for visual elements.  Initial filters are set to a default date range and completed status.

`lineBookingApi.ts` (9/11/2025, 3:35:34 PM): This file defines API endpoints using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query`.  Endpoints include creating, fetching (dashboard data, details, and card data), confirming, and canceling line bookings.  All endpoints use `getAppHeaders()` for authentication, suggesting secure API calls.  The `cancelLineBooking` mutation uses a GET request, which is unconventional but may be due to specific API requirements.

`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` (9/11/2025, 3:38:51 PM - 9/11/2025, 3:44:20 PM): This component, displaying line booking details, underwent several minor revisions. Initially, it fetched data using `vesselData?.voyageDetails?.serial_id`. This was later corrected to use just `state?.serial_id` to correctly fetch details, improving the component's reliability.  The component renders a `LineBookingForm` for adding or editing line booking information based on the `formAction` state from the navigation.

In summary, the code changes reflect the iterative development of a line booking management system. The updates focus on enhancing the user interface for data presentation and interaction, improving API integration for data management, and refining the data fetching logic within specific components to ensure that data is accurately retrieved.  The consistent use of `getAppHeaders()` points to a centralized authentication system for the application.


## 3:48:39 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `linebookingService.ts` file between 3:09 PM and 3:30 PM on September 11, 2025.  The primary function of this service appears to be managing line bookings, including creation, retrieval, updates, and status changes.

The `create` function inserts new line bookings into the `line_booking_master` table and associated equipment details into `line_booking_equipments`.  The `update` function allows modification of existing bookings, deleting old equipment entries before inserting new ones.  Both functions use database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.

The `getAll` function retrieves all line bookings, optionally filtered by `line_booking_no` and paginated.  Early revisions lacked logging of the `rows` variable, while later revisions added logging of the query builder (`qb`) object itself and changed the return to include equipment details directly in the response. The final revision changed the response from returning `rows` to returning `bookingsWithEquip` which contains equipments.

The `getByVesselVoyageId` function retrieves line bookings associated with a specific `vessel_voyage_id`, including equipment details.

The `confirmLineBooking` function updates the status of a line booking to "CONFIRM," requires a `do_number`, and also uploads files using the `saveDoc` function.  The `changeStatus` function allows changing the status of a line booking, currently only permitting changing to `LineBookingStatus.CANCELLED`.  Both functions use database transactions.

Recurring elements include extensive use of SQL queries for database interaction, comprehensive error handling with HTTP status codes, and consistent logging using the `logger` utility.  The most significant change across revisions is within the `getAll` functionâ€”adding logging statements and refactoring how the query is built and the response is formatted in the final version.  The improvements made in `getAll`  involved  fetching equipment data alongside main booking data, enhancing efficiency by reducing the number of queries.  Error handling has also been consistently improved in different functions by logging the error using the logger and consistently returning a 500 error response.


## 4:48:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files within a frontend application, likely for managing line bookings.  The most significant changes occur in `LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx`.

**`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent many revisions between 3:48 PM and 4:03 PM on September 11, 2025.  The core changes involved how it fetches and displays line booking details. Initially, it had issues handling the `serial_id` (likely a unique identifier)  for fetching data, correcting the type to accommodate both numbers and strings.  Subsequent changes focused on correctly populating the `LineBookingForm`'s initial values based on whether the form is for creating a new booking or editing an existing one.  The use of `skipToken` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/query` suggests the use of a Redux toolkit-based API for data fetching.  The final version retrieves data based on `vessel_voyage_id` and, if editing, uses a `find` operation to pre-fill the form with the correct `serial_id`.

**`LineBookingDashboard.tsx` (Single Revision):** This component, updated at 3:52 PM, appears to be a dashboard for displaying a list of line bookings.  Key features include search, filtering (using a `FilterSidebar` component), sorting, pagination, data export to Excel using a `generateExcel` utility, and modals for confirming and cancelling bookings. It fetches data using `useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery` showing the use of a Redux-based API for data fetching.

**`action.tsx` (Single Revision):** Updated at 3:53 PM, this file defines actions for line bookings within a data grid, including edit, confirm, and cancel actions. It uses icons from `@heroicons/react` and `react-icons`.  The functions dynamically generate the menu items based on user access roles (`access` object).

**`LineBooking.types.ts` (Single Revision):** This file, modified at 4:02 PM, defines TypeScript interfaces for various data structures used in the application, including data types for line booking information, filter states, and data grid columns. The inclusion of interfaces like `LineBooking`, `LineBookingEqup` and `BookingPayload` clarifies the structure of data handled.

**Recurring Elements:** Consistent use of `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` for navigation, and components from `@components` suggest a well-structured component library. The repeated use of `useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery` and `useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery` points to a consistent API interaction method via Redux Toolkit. The prevalent use of tailwind CSS classes implies it is used for styling.


## 5:48:22 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` between 4:50 PM and 5:43 PM on September 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the data handling and submission logic for a line booking form within a React application.

**`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` Changes:**

* **4:50 PM:** Initial commit.  The component fetches line booking details using `useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery`, handles loading and error states, and renders a `LineBookingForm` component with initial values computed based on whether it's a new or edit booking.  It uses `useMemo` to manage the initial values.

* **4:50:56 PM:**  `useMemo` was removed and `useState` was used to manage `lineBookingData`.  Error handling and loading indicators were removed.

* **4:56:25 PM:** The component now uses `useEffect` to update the `lineBookingData` state after the API call completes, correctly mapping the API response data.  Loading and error states are reintroduced.  `useState` is used to manage the state instead of `useMemo`.


**`LineBookingForm.tsx` Changes:**

This file underwent significant changes across multiple commits between 4:56 PM and 5:43 PM:

* **4:56 PM - 5:23 PM (Multiple Commits):**  These commits involved iterative changes to the form's submission logic. Initially, the `onSubmit` handler attempted to handle both "add" and "edit" modes but had issues with data structuring for the API call (particularly in the edit mode). The initial values handling within `useFormik` was refined, ensuring correct data is used for both "add" and "edit" scenarios.

* **5:23:33 PM - 5:35 PM (Multiple Commits):** The way `tableData` which supplies data to the table was altered. Several changes to correct the logic  of how data is populated in the table and handled by formik was performed.

* **5:31 PM and 5:32 PM:** Corrections in table data handling and passing the correct data to the formik form.

* **5:35 PM:** A `serial_id` is added to the navigation state for edit mode in the pencil icon's `onClick` handler.


* **5:40 PM - 5:43 PM (Multiple Commits):**  The `onSubmit` handler is refined.  Separate success messages ("Line booking Added successfully", "Line booking Updated successfully") are shown for "add" and "edit" operations, making the feedback clearer.  The edit mode submission using  `initialValues.line_bookings` is initially included but then commented out in later commits, indicating a decision to only handle the "add" mode in the `LineBookingForm` for now.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Consistent use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useFormik`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and custom hooks).
* Extensive use of React's functional components.
* Reliance on Redux for state management (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`).
* Use of RTK Query for API interactions (`useFetchLineBookingDetailsQuery`, `useSaveLineBookingMutation`).
* Consistent navigation to `/app/export/line_booking` after form submission.
* The code uses Tailwind CSS for styling (evident in class names).


In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a progressive refinement of the line booking form functionality. The initial versions struggled with correct data handling, especially during edit operations. Subsequent commits improved data flow, error handling, and user feedback making the code cleaner, more efficient, and more robust.  The final commit appears to simplify the form submission logic, focusing solely on "add" functionality for the `LineBookingForm` itself.


## 11:28:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `linebookingService.ts` file on September 11th, 2025.  The key changes revolve around the `update` function.

Initially, the `update` function included `booking_date` in the SQL UPDATE statement.  Between 6:12:06 PM and 6:13:01 PM,  `booking_date` was commented out from the `UPDATE line_booking_master` query in the update function, reducing the number of parameters from 11 to 10.  A subsequent change at 6:13:47 PM further adjusted the `UPDATE` statement parameter order by changing the order of parameters to match the order of columns.

Throughout all revisions, the code maintains a consistent structure:  using transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`), handling input validation, interacting with a database (`insertQuery`, `query`), logging using a `logger` object, and returning standard JSON responses indicating success or error.  The `getAll`, `getByVesselVoyageId`, `confirmLineBooking`, and `changeStatus` functions remained largely unchanged across all revisions.  The consistent use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) is also notable.
