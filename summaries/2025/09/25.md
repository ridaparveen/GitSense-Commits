# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 10:36:50 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\customerDataApi.ts`, both within a minute of each other (9/25/2025, 5:26 AM).  The file defines API endpoints for interacting with customer data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`.

The primary change between the two revisions is in the `saveGstLoaction` mutation.  The initial version uses the URL `/api/customer/save-g`, while the second revision corrects it to `/api/customer/create`.  No other functional changes are observed, only this URL correction within the `saveGstLoaction` endpoint's `query` function.  The rest of the code (endpoints for fetching customer dashboard data, card info, details, and GST location) remains identical across both revisions.  All endpoints consistently utilize `getAppHeaders()` for request headers.


## 10:36:52 AM
The log shows modifications to API routes within an Express.js application.  The primary changes center around `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`, which defines API endpoint paths.  This file was updated twice within a short timeframe (between 5:27 AM and 5:28 AM on September 25th, 2025), but the content remained identical in both revisions.

A later modification at 9:49:52 AM on September 25th, 2025, occurred in `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\customerRoutes.ts`. This file defines Express routes for customer-related operations, making use of the path constants defined in `Paths.ts`.  Specifically, this commit updated the route handler for fetching customer details. The original handler `fetchCustomerData` was replaced with `GetCustomerDetails`.  The rest of the customer routes (`getAll`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `CreateCustomer`, `UpdateCustomer`, `saveCustomerDetails`, and `fetchGstLocationData`) remained unchanged in this commit.  The routes cover standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and additional functions for dashboards and GST location data.  There's a consistent pattern of using the `Paths` constant to define routes, promoting maintainability and organization.


## 11:36:52 AM
The file `Paths.ts` was updated on September 25, 2025, at 10:46:24 AM.  This file defines a TypeScript object containing API endpoint paths for various modules within the application.  The update comprehensively outlines routing paths for features including user management (Users), authentication (Auth), autocompletion (AutoComplete), document upload and management (UploadDocuments), customer management (Customer), line booking (Linebooking), customer booking (CusotomerBooking), vessel management (Vessel), voyage management (Voyage), vendor management (Vendor), and general document management (Document). Each module is structured with base paths and specific paths for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other functionalities.  The consistent use of base paths suggests a well-structured API design.  There are also some inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "CusotomerBooking" instead of "CustomerBooking", "voayge" instead of "voyage").


## 11:37:02 AM
The log shows extensive development on a React frontend application, focusing on customer data management.  Several files were modified between 10:41 AM and 11:18 AM on September 25, 2025.

`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`: This component initially rendered a `CustomerGSTForm`.  Subsequent changes involved integrating API calls (`useCreateCustomerDetailsMutation`, `useUpdateCustomerMutation`) for creating and updating customer details.  The component now handles form submission based on an "edit" flag passed via the `location.state` object. Error handling via `react-hot-toast` was added. Finally, the component stopped rendering `CustomerGSTForm` and instead uses  `CustomerDetailsForm`.


`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`: This component underwent significant revision.  Initially, it used `useFormik` for form management and directly handled GST location data.  Later, it was refactored to become a functional component (`FC`) accepting `initialValues`, `mode` ("add" or "edit"), and an `onSubmit` callback.  The major change involved merging GST location data from Redux (`gstLocations`) and an API call (`useFetchCustomerDetailsQuery`) to ensure consistency.  The component now uses a more sophisticated merging strategy for GST location data from the API and Redux. The `formik` hook was removed.


`customerDataApi.ts`: This file, containing API slices, was updated multiple times. The primary changes were the addition and renaming of API endpoints:  `createCustomerDetails` was renamed to `saveCustomerDetails` and a new `createCustomer` mutation was added.  This suggests a separation of concerns, likely to improve API organization.


`App.tsx`:  This file, the main application router, was updated to reflect changes in component names and routing paths. Notably, the path `/master/customer/addNewCustomerForm`  is now associated with `CustomerDetailsForm`. The path to `/master/customer/gst-location` was added.


`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`: This component, introduced late in the log, is a form for detailed customer information, including GST locations. It uses `useFormik` for form handling, integrates with Redux for updating GST locations via `addGST` and `updateGST` actions and now handles both creating and updating GST locations based on `isEditing` state.  It fetches existing customer data using `useGetCustomerDetailsQuery`.


`customerGstLocationSlice.ts`: This Redux slice manages GST location data. The `addGST` reducer was changed to handle both new and existing GST locations while avoiding duplicates based on `serial_id`.  The `updateGST` reducer updates specific GST rows based on the provided `serial_id`.


The overall pattern is a shift towards a more structured approach, separating concerns between components and API calls and using Redux for state management. The changes indicate a focus on improving data consistency and handling both new and updated customer data effectively.  There's a noticeable emphasis on managing GST location data, suggesting this is a crucial feature of the application.
