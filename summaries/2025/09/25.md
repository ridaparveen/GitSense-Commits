# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 10:36:50 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\customerDataApi.ts`, both within a minute of each other (9/25/2025, 5:26 AM).  The file defines API endpoints for interacting with customer data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`.

The primary change between the two revisions is in the `saveGstLoaction` mutation.  The initial version uses the URL `/api/customer/save-g`, while the second revision corrects it to `/api/customer/create`.  No other functional changes are observed, only this URL correction within the `saveGstLoaction` endpoint's `query` function.  The rest of the code (endpoints for fetching customer dashboard data, card info, details, and GST location) remains identical across both revisions.  All endpoints consistently utilize `getAppHeaders()` for request headers.


## 10:36:52 AM
The log shows modifications to API routes within an Express.js application.  The primary changes center around `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`, which defines API endpoint paths.  This file was updated twice within a short timeframe (between 5:27 AM and 5:28 AM on September 25th, 2025), but the content remained identical in both revisions.

A later modification at 9:49:52 AM on September 25th, 2025, occurred in `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\customerRoutes.ts`. This file defines Express routes for customer-related operations, making use of the path constants defined in `Paths.ts`.  Specifically, this commit updated the route handler for fetching customer details. The original handler `fetchCustomerData` was replaced with `GetCustomerDetails`.  The rest of the customer routes (`getAll`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `CreateCustomer`, `UpdateCustomer`, `saveCustomerDetails`, and `fetchGstLocationData`) remained unchanged in this commit.  The routes cover standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and additional functions for dashboards and GST location data.  There's a consistent pattern of using the `Paths` constant to define routes, promoting maintainability and organization.


## 11:36:52 AM
The file `Paths.ts` was updated on September 25, 2025, at 10:46:24 AM.  This file defines a TypeScript object containing API endpoint paths for various modules within the application.  The update comprehensively outlines routing paths for features including user management (Users), authentication (Auth), autocompletion (AutoComplete), document upload and management (UploadDocuments), customer management (Customer), line booking (Linebooking), customer booking (CusotomerBooking), vessel management (Vessel), voyage management (Voyage), vendor management (Vendor), and general document management (Document). Each module is structured with base paths and specific paths for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other functionalities.  The consistent use of base paths suggests a well-structured API design.  There are also some inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "CusotomerBooking" instead of "CustomerBooking", "voayge" instead of "voyage").


## 11:37:02 AM
The log shows extensive development on a React frontend application, focusing on customer data management.  Several files were modified between 10:41 AM and 11:18 AM on September 25, 2025.

`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`: This component initially rendered a `CustomerGSTForm`.  Subsequent changes involved integrating API calls (`useCreateCustomerDetailsMutation`, `useUpdateCustomerMutation`) for creating and updating customer details.  The component now handles form submission based on an "edit" flag passed via the `location.state` object. Error handling via `react-hot-toast` was added. Finally, the component stopped rendering `CustomerGSTForm` and instead uses  `CustomerDetailsForm`.


`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`: This component underwent significant revision.  Initially, it used `useFormik` for form management and directly handled GST location data.  Later, it was refactored to become a functional component (`FC`) accepting `initialValues`, `mode` ("add" or "edit"), and an `onSubmit` callback.  The major change involved merging GST location data from Redux (`gstLocations`) and an API call (`useFetchCustomerDetailsQuery`) to ensure consistency.  The component now uses a more sophisticated merging strategy for GST location data from the API and Redux. The `formik` hook was removed.


`customerDataApi.ts`: This file, containing API slices, was updated multiple times. The primary changes were the addition and renaming of API endpoints:  `createCustomerDetails` was renamed to `saveCustomerDetails` and a new `createCustomer` mutation was added.  This suggests a separation of concerns, likely to improve API organization.


`App.tsx`:  This file, the main application router, was updated to reflect changes in component names and routing paths. Notably, the path `/master/customer/addNewCustomerForm`  is now associated with `CustomerDetailsForm`. The path to `/master/customer/gst-location` was added.


`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`: This component, introduced late in the log, is a form for detailed customer information, including GST locations. It uses `useFormik` for form handling, integrates with Redux for updating GST locations via `addGST` and `updateGST` actions and now handles both creating and updating GST locations based on `isEditing` state.  It fetches existing customer data using `useGetCustomerDetailsQuery`.


`customerGstLocationSlice.ts`: This Redux slice manages GST location data. The `addGST` reducer was changed to handle both new and existing GST locations while avoiding duplicates based on `serial_id`.  The `updateGST` reducer updates specific GST rows based on the provided `serial_id`.


The overall pattern is a shift towards a more structured approach, separating concerns between components and API calls and using Redux for state management. The changes indicate a focus on improving data consistency and handling both new and updated customer data effectively.  There's a noticeable emphasis on managing GST location data, suggesting this is a crucial feature of the application.


## 12:36:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `customerService.ts` file on September 25th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is on the `CreateCustomer` function.

Initially, the `CreateCustomer` function had a bug where it treated `customer_id` as optional, resulting in a potential error. This was corrected in a subsequent commit at 12:20:10 PM where the  `if` condition was changed from `if (customer_id)` to `if (!customer_id)`, ensuring that a `customer_id` is always provided.  Additionally, a minor change was made at 12:23:23 PM within the `CreateCustomer` function; the `type` field in `gstPayload` was given a default value of an empty string "".


The `getAll` function remains largely unchanged throughout the log entries. It retrieves customer data based on various filter parameters (page, perPage, status, dates, customer type, ID, location, name) and supports ordering.  This function uses a `QueryBuilder` for constructing the database queries, which are logged for debugging. The response includes data, pagination information, and options for dropdowns.

The `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo` function retrieves dashboard card information (active, inactive, total customers) based on date filters ("weekly," "monthly," "all").

The `saveCustomerDetails` function inserts new customer details into the database, generating a unique `customer_id`.  It uses transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency.

All functions consistently use transaction management (`query("BEGIN")`, `query("COMMIT")`, `query("ROLLBACK")`) to handle database operations safely and catch errors, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  The code uses several custom types (`IReq`, `IRes`, `CustomerPayloadTypes`, etc.) and utility functions from other modules within the project.  The consistent use of  `console.log` statements throughout the functions suggests a focus on debugging during development.


## 12:36:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` and `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` components, and the `customer.types.ts` file, all occurring on September 25th, 2025.

The main focus of the changes is the implementation of GST location management within the customer details page.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\customer\CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`**:

* **Initial Revisions (12:03:50 PM - 12:09:16 PM):**  These revisions centered around refining the initial state (`customerData`) of the `CustomerDetailsPage`. Initially, the `customer` object in `customerData` contained all customer details including nested arrays for `keyPersonalDetails`, `alertMappingDetails`, `creditControlDetails`, and `facDetails`.  The `serial_id` within these nested arrays were initially set to the current timestamp. Subsequent revisions modified the `customerData` structure to correctly populate the `customer_id` field using data from `detailsQuery.customer_id` received through the `useLocation` hook.  The `serial_id` in the nested arrays remained as dynamically generated timestamps.   The component uses `useCreateCustomerMutation` and `useUpdateCustomerMutation` to handle create and update operations, respectively.  Success and failure messages are displayed using `react-hot-toast`.  Navigation is managed via `useNavigate`.

* **Later Revisions (12:12:54 PM - 12:21:49 PM):**  A significant restructuring occurred. The `customerData` was changed to a different structure using `customer_id` and `gstLocations` (an array) to represent multiple GST locations.  This suggests a shift towards handling multiple GST locations per customer. The nested array structure remained the same.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\customer.types.ts`:**

* **Revision at 12:13:24 PM:** This revision reflects the structural changes introduced in `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`. The `CustomerFormValues` interface was updated to include `customer_id` and `gstLocations` to align with the new data structure for managing multiple GST locations.  Other interfaces like `CustomerData`, `KeyPersonalList`, `AlertMappingList`, etc., define the structure of customer information and associated details.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\GstCustomerLocation.tsx`:**

* **Multiple Revisions (12:14:19 PM - 12:26:17 PM):** These revisions show a progressive refinement of the GST location form. Initially, the component used `useFormik` and a `handleSubmit` function with commented-out code.  The form is integrated with Redux actions (`addGST`, `deleteGST`) and uses `useFetchCustomerDetailsQuery` to fetch existing data. The crucial merge logic combines API data and Redux state to create `finalGstData`, which represents all GST locations (from API and local state).  The  `useSaveGstLoactionMutation` is used to send the data to the backend.  The component includes functionality to add, edit, and delete GST locations, navigation is handled through `useNavigate`.  The revisions demonstrate a move away from using `useFormik` to a more direct interaction with Redux and the API.


In summary, the code changes reflect a major refactoring to support multiple GST locations per customer.  The initial implementation involved a less structured approach; the final version incorporates a more robust system using Redux for managing local state and merging it with data fetched from an API before sending it to the backend for saving. The use of formik was removed and state management was simplified.


## 3:58:57 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `customerService.ts` file between 12:49 PM and 3:57 PM on September 25, 2025, focusing on customer data management.  The `customerRoutes.ts` file was also updated at 3:17 PM.

**`customerService.ts` Changes:**

The primary focus of the revisions is on the `getAll` function.  Initial versions included basic filtering and pagination for customer data.  Subsequent revisions progressively modified the query to include GST location data using subqueries.  There's a clear evolution in how this data is joined and formatted within the `getAll` function's SQL query:

* **Initial versions (12:49 PM, 12:50 PM, 12:51 PM, 12:54 PM):** The `getAll` function retrieves customer data with filtering and pagination but does not include GST location details.
* **Intermediate versions (3:22 PM, 3:23 PM):** Attempts were made to include GST location data using a subquery within the SELECT statement, creating a `gst` object with a limited number of columns.
* **Final version (3:57 PM):**  The subquery was corrected to use `json_build_object` to improve the structure of the returned `gst` data, which  is now more likely to be a JSON object. The `CreateCustomer` function shows ongoing work, with many fields commented out in intermediate versions and then reinstated in the last version


The `CreateCustomer` function underwent significant changes, initially including nested loops for inserting data into related tables (`customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, `customer_credit_control`, `customer_fac`).  Later revisions largely commented out these nested loops, suggesting a potential refactoring or change in approach to data insertion.  A `toIntOrNull` helper function was added at 12:57 PM for safer handling of integer values.  The final version includes all these fields, seemingly suggesting the initial plan of nested loops has been reinstated.

**`customerRoutes.ts` Changes:**

The update at 3:17 PM to `customerRoutes.ts` primarily involved replacing the commented-out `fetchGstLocationData` route with `fetchCustomerData`, suggesting a simplification or refactoring of the API routes to retrieve customer data.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development focusing on efficient retrieval and handling of customer data, including related GST information. The `CreateCustomer` function's evolution suggests some experimentation and potentially refactoring of database interaction for managing related data. The final version's SQL query in `getAll` seems more efficient and the added function `toIntOrNull` will lead to more robust and less prone-to-error code.


## 3:59:00 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the frontend components and pages related to customer GST location management within the `envosys-frontend` application.  Changes span from September 25th, 2025, between 12:46 PM and 3:53 PM.

`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`: This component undergoes several revisions.  Initially, it focuses on handling form submission for adding or updating GST locations, interacting with Redux store (using `addGST` and `updateGST` actions) and making API calls (`useSaveGstLoactionMutation`).  Later updates include improving error handling and clarifying the success message, and modifications to logging statements.  The core functionality of adding and updating GST locations remains consistent.

`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`: This page is modified to integrate with the `CustomerGSTForm` component, primarily used to manage and display GST locations.  Early versions show substantial default data initialization for a `CustomerFormValues` object. Subsequent updates refine data fetching using `useFetchCustomerDetailsQuery` and handling the edit functionality by passing serial ID for updating the data and using skipToken for initial loading. The code demonstrates navigation between pages using `useNavigate` hook with state for data passing, and incorporates error handling using `toast`.


`GstCustomerLocation.tsx`: This component is central to GST location management. It includes functionalities to add, edit, and delete GST locations.  Early revisions contain commented-out code and display console logs for debugging. The major changes include simplifying the merging logic of GST Locations data and added error handling and clarified the success messages. The structure of the form and table for displaying GST locations is significantly improved and refined across multiple commits.  A stable `key` property is added in the final version for GST locations in table rendering.



`action.tsx`: This file defines actions for a data grid, providing Edit, View, Copy HBL, and Delete options. The primary change involves improving the data passed to the navigation functions for the Edit action by including the whole row object instead of just the serial id.

`customerGstLocationSlice.ts`: This Redux slice manages the GST location state.  It includes reducers for adding, updating, and deleting GST locations, along with setting customer status and resetting the form. The comments clearly outline the purpose of each reducer.  The `addGST` reducer is improved to handle cases where the serial ID might be provided by the backend.

`GetCustomerPopup.tsx`: This component, added towards the end of the log, provides a popup for saving customer details via API call (`useSaveCustomerDetailsMutation`) and navigating to GST location management after successful saving.  Minor corrections in navigation state are implemented in later commits.

Overall, the code changes demonstrate a pattern of iterative development, focusing on refining data handling, improving user experience (adding more descriptive messages), and adding error handling to make the application more robust.  The changes show a consistent effort to improve the GST location management features, including using RTK Query for API calls and Redux for state management.


## 4:58:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `customerService.ts` file between 4:05 PM and 4:54 PM on September 25, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is refining the `getAll` function, which retrieves customer data.

Initially, the `getAll` function used `gs.customer_id` in the JOIN condition of the query builder. This was subsequently corrected to `gs.serial_id = cs.serial_id` in a later commit at 4:05:37 PM, fixing a join condition error.  Further changes at 4:41:21 PM and 4:41:32 PM  added `cs.` prefixes to column names within the filter conditions in the `getAll` function  to ensure unambiguous column referencing within the QueryBuilder. This improves the clarity and robustness of the query.  There were no other functional changes to the `getAll` function between the last two commits. No significant changes were made to other functions (`getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `saveCustomerDetails`, `CreateCustomer`) in the file across these commits.  The `CreateCustomer` function contains commented-out code for inserting data into related tables (`customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, `customer_credit_control`).  This suggests planned features or functionality that have yet to be implemented.


## 5:58:52 PM
The log shows updates to `customerService.ts` on September 25th, 2025, at 5:36:49 PM.  The file contains several functions related to customer management in a Node.js backend application.  The functions utilize a custom `QueryBuilder` class for database interactions, employing PostgreSQL's `json_agg` function for creating dropdown options.

`getAll` retrieves customer data with extensive filtering and pagination options, including status, date range, customer type, ID, location, and name, using `moment.js` for date formatting.

`getCustomerDashboardCardInfo` retrieves summarized customer dashboard information (active, inactive, total customer counts) based on date ranges or weekly/monthly filters.

`saveCustomerDetails` saves new customer details, generating a unique `customer_id`, and uses transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency.

`CreateCustomer` handles creation of customer GST locations, inserting data into the `customer_gst_location` table.  The code also includes commented-out sections suggesting planned functionality for inserting additional related data (key personal details, alert mappings, credit controls, and FAC details) into respective tables;  this functionality is not yet implemented.  The function also performs input validation, checking for the presence of `customer_id`.  All functions use a common set of types imported from `../models/common/types/customer` and database utility functions from `../common/util`.  Error handling is implemented using `HttpStatusCodes` and logging is done via a `logger` object.
