# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 10:36:50 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\customerDataApi.ts`, both within a minute of each other (9/25/2025, 5:26 AM).  The file defines API endpoints for interacting with customer data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`.

The primary change between the two revisions is in the `saveGstLoaction` mutation.  The initial version uses the URL `/api/customer/save-g`, while the second revision corrects it to `/api/customer/create`.  No other functional changes are observed, only this URL correction within the `saveGstLoaction` endpoint's `query` function.  The rest of the code (endpoints for fetching customer dashboard data, card info, details, and GST location) remains identical across both revisions.  All endpoints consistently utilize `getAppHeaders()` for request headers.
