# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 10:36:50 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\customerDataApi.ts`, both within a minute of each other (9/25/2025, 5:26 AM).  The file defines API endpoints for interacting with customer data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`.

The primary change between the two revisions is in the `saveGstLoaction` mutation.  The initial version uses the URL `/api/customer/save-g`, while the second revision corrects it to `/api/customer/create`.  No other functional changes are observed, only this URL correction within the `saveGstLoaction` endpoint's `query` function.  The rest of the code (endpoints for fetching customer dashboard data, card info, details, and GST location) remains identical across both revisions.  All endpoints consistently utilize `getAppHeaders()` for request headers.


## 10:36:52 AM
The log shows modifications to API routes within an Express.js application.  The primary changes center around `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`, which defines API endpoint paths.  This file was updated twice within a short timeframe (between 5:27 AM and 5:28 AM on September 25th, 2025), but the content remained identical in both revisions.

A later modification at 9:49:52 AM on September 25th, 2025, occurred in `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\customerRoutes.ts`. This file defines Express routes for customer-related operations, making use of the path constants defined in `Paths.ts`.  Specifically, this commit updated the route handler for fetching customer details. The original handler `fetchCustomerData` was replaced with `GetCustomerDetails`.  The rest of the customer routes (`getAll`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `CreateCustomer`, `UpdateCustomer`, `saveCustomerDetails`, and `fetchGstLocationData`) remained unchanged in this commit.  The routes cover standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and additional functions for dashboards and GST location data.  There's a consistent pattern of using the `Paths` constant to define routes, promoting maintainability and organization.


## 11:36:52 AM
The file `Paths.ts` was updated on September 25, 2025, at 10:46:24 AM.  This file defines a TypeScript object containing API endpoint paths for various modules within the application.  The update comprehensively outlines routing paths for features including user management (Users), authentication (Auth), autocompletion (AutoComplete), document upload and management (UploadDocuments), customer management (Customer), line booking (Linebooking), customer booking (CusotomerBooking), vessel management (Vessel), voyage management (Voyage), vendor management (Vendor), and general document management (Document). Each module is structured with base paths and specific paths for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other functionalities.  The consistent use of base paths suggests a well-structured API design.  There are also some inconsistencies in spelling (e.g., "CusotomerBooking" instead of "CustomerBooking", "voayge" instead of "voyage").
