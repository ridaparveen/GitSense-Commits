# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 10:36:50 AM
The log shows two revisions of `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\customerDataApi.ts`, both within a minute of each other (9/25/2025, 5:26 AM).  The file defines API endpoints for interacting with customer data using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`.

The primary change between the two revisions is in the `saveGstLoaction` mutation.  The initial version uses the URL `/api/customer/save-g`, while the second revision corrects it to `/api/customer/create`.  No other functional changes are observed, only this URL correction within the `saveGstLoaction` endpoint's `query` function.  The rest of the code (endpoints for fetching customer dashboard data, card info, details, and GST location) remains identical across both revisions.  All endpoints consistently utilize `getAppHeaders()` for request headers.


## 10:36:52 AM
The log shows modifications to API routes within an Express.js application.  The primary changes center around `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`, which defines API endpoint paths.  This file was updated twice within a short timeframe (between 5:27 AM and 5:28 AM on September 25th, 2025), but the content remained identical in both revisions.

A later modification at 9:49:52 AM on September 25th, 2025, occurred in `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\customerRoutes.ts`. This file defines Express routes for customer-related operations, making use of the path constants defined in `Paths.ts`.  Specifically, this commit updated the route handler for fetching customer details. The original handler `fetchCustomerData` was replaced with `GetCustomerDetails`.  The rest of the customer routes (`getAll`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `CreateCustomer`, `UpdateCustomer`, `saveCustomerDetails`, and `fetchGstLocationData`) remained unchanged in this commit.  The routes cover standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and additional functions for dashboards and GST location data.  There's a consistent pattern of using the `Paths` constant to define routes, promoting maintainability and organization.
