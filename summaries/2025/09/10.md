# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 12:14:40 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `uploadDocuments.ts` service file and the `multerConfig.ts` configuration file between September 9th, 2025, 11:16 PM and September 10th, 2025, 12:08 AM.  The changes revolve around document upload, retrieval, and deletion functionalities.

**`uploadDocuments.ts` Changes:**

The most significant changes occurred in `uploadDocuments.ts`. Initially, the `uploadDocument` function had unnecessary or commented-out code.  Over several edits (between 11:16 PM and 11:58 PM), the function was refined:

* **Removal of Unnecessary Parameters:** The `uploadDocument` function's request body parameters were gradually reduced, removing `ref_type` and `ref_id`  from the required parameters, simplifying the upload process.  The `remark` parameter was also removed completely.

* **Single File Upload:** The code was modified to handle single file uploads instead of multiple files (using `upload.single("file")` in `index.ts` instead of `upload.array("files", 10)`), reflecting in the changes made to `uploadDocument` function between 11:35 PM and 11:56 PM.

* **Original Filename:** The code was changed to use `req.file.originalname` for storing the original filename in the database.  This improved the accuracy of file name storage.

* **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling was maintained throughout, using `HttpError` and logging errors using the `logger` utility.

* **File Path Adjustment:** The logic for extracting the document path was adjusted, possibly to reflect a change in the upload directory structure and this was done between 11:46 PM and 11:58 PM.

The `fetchUploadedDocuments`, `deleteDocument`, and `downloadDocument` functions remained largely unchanged throughout the log entries, demonstrating stability in these areas.  The `fetchUploadedDocuments` function constructs download links using `${process.env.BACKEND_BASE_URL}`, which implies the use of environment variables for the base URL.


**`multerConfig.ts` Changes:**

A key change happened in `multerConfig.ts` at 12:08 AM on September 10th.  This involved creating the upload directory ("envosys_uploads") programmatically within the `multerConfig.ts` file itself, ensuring its existence before file uploads. This improves robustness by proactively handling missing directory issues. The filename generation was also simplified to use the original filename with a timestamp.


**Overall Pattern:**

The edits to `uploadDocuments.ts` show an iterative refinement process, focusing on streamlining the upload function and improving the accuracy of information stored.  The change in `multerConfig.ts`  suggests a proactive approach to improve the reliability of the file upload mechanism.  The overall process demonstrates a debugging and improvement cycle.


## 12:14:46 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the Envosys frontend, primarily focused on enhancing document upload functionality.

**`ApiEndPoint.ts`**: This file defines API endpoints.  A significant change (10:45:40 PM) simplifies the `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` endpoint, removing the FormData appending logic from the endpoint definition itself and leaving it solely to the ApiManager.

**`ApiManager.ts`**: This file manages API calls. It was updated (10:45:22 PM) to include methods for login, fetching common and global options, and uploading documents.  The `uploadDocument` method constructs a FormData object and uses it to make a POST request. A commented-out section suggests that user settings retrieval functionality existed earlier but was removed.

**`uploadDocumentApi.ts`**: This file uses Redux Toolkit's `createApi` to define API slices for document management.  Multiple updates occurred between 10:48:03 PM and 10:48:14 PM, primarily removing unused imports and reducing the number of exported hooks.  A later change (11:09:47 PM) updates the upload endpoint URL to `/api/upload-documents`, indicating a possible change to the backend API.  The crucial modification here is removing manual setting of "Content-Type" header in the `uploadDocument` mutation query, allowing `fetchBaseQuery` to handle it correctly for FormData.


**`store/store.ts`**: This file configures the Redux store.  It was updated (10:49:09 PM) to include the `uploadDocumentApi` reducer and middleware.

**`UploadFiles.tsx`**: This component handles file uploads.  The most significant changes involved refining the file upload process. Initially, it attempted to upload only a single file.  Subsequent modifications  (between 11:00:56 PM and 11:54:14 PM)  introduced support for multiple file uploads within each row, improved error handling, and streamlined the UI.  The final version (11:54:14 PM) refactors the code to allow for a single file upload per row, uses a separate upload button,  and implements a visual indicator to show which row is currently uploading. The key change is making the `UploadDocument` interface in `customer.types.ts` accept an array of files instead of a single file, which allows for multiple file uploads. The upload button only becomes enabled when a file is selected.  Finally, the upload happens after file selection, instead of after button click.

**`customer.types.ts`**:  The `UploadDocument` interface in this file, defining the structure for uploaded documents, was modified (between 11:41:17 PM and 11:42:22 PM) to include a `file?: File` property, allowing for optional File objects to be stored along with the document metadata.  This is directly related to the `UploadFiles.tsx` component's enhancement to support multiple files.

The overall pattern across the changes demonstrates a shift from a single-file upload system to one supporting multiple files per upload operation, along with improvements to the user interface and error handling.  The majority of updates occurred between 10:44 PM and 11:54 PM on September 9th, 2025, with a final minor update at 12:02 AM on September 10th, 2025.


## 10:38:25 AM
The log shows changes to the backend routing (`index.ts`) and multer configuration (`multerConfig.ts`) files on September 10, 2025.

`index.ts` (9:53:37 AM): This file defines the API router, incorporating authentication (`AuthRoutes`), master routes (`MasterRoutes`), and a search endpoint (`getAll`).  Import statements for a shipment route and file upload (`multerConfig`) are commented out, suggesting these features may have been temporarily disabled or removed.


`multerConfig.ts` (9:54:28 AM): This file configures multer for file uploads. It creates a directory (`envosys_uploads`) for storing uploaded files, handling file naming using timestamps, and includes a file filter to restrict uploads to JPEG, PNG, and PDF files. The creation of the upload directory is handled programmatically, ensuring it exists before accepting uploads.  The close proximity of timestamps suggests these changes may be related; potentially the commented-out upload functionality in `index.ts` relates to the newly configured multer setup.


## 12:38:52 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a React frontend application, primarily focused on customer and line booking functionalities.

**ApiEndPoint.ts (9/10/2025, 9:56:37 AM):** This file defines API endpoints for login and autocomplete functionalities.  The `LOGIN` endpoint is a simple `/temp-auth/login` route, while `GET_COMMON_OPTIONS` constructs a query string for autocomplete based on provided `name` and `search` parameters.

**ApiManager.ts (9/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM):** This file uses the endpoints defined in `ApiEndPoint.ts` to create an `ApiManager` class. This class provides `login` and `getCommonOptions` static methods that handle HTTP requests using a presumed `ApiMethods` class (not shown in the log). The `login` method accepts a `LoginPayload` interface with username, password, and other optional fields.

**customer-columns.tsx (9/10/2025, 10:36:11 AM & 9/10/2025, 11:04:26 AM):** This file defines column configurations for a table, likely used to display customer data.  Multiple constant arrays (`GstDetailsColumn`, `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn`, `AlertMappingColumn`, `facDetailsColumn`) specify column keys, header names, widths, and data types (text, select, date, autosearch). The second timestamp reflects the addition of `options` to the `facDetailsColumn`, providing example options for 'Country' and 'City' selections.

**CreditControl.tsx (9/10/2025, 10:39:11 AM - 9/10/2025, 10:49:40 AM):** This component renders a form with expandable sections for credit control details.  Multiple revisions involved refining the handling of dropdown changes within the formik form structure to correctly update field values.  The final version uses a defined `pdcOptions` constant for cleaner code.


**CustomerDetailsForm.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:08:45 AM - 9/10/2025, 11:15:43 AM):**  This component handles form submission for customer details. It fetches customer data using RTK Query and dispatches Redux actions (`addGST`, `updateGST`) to manage GST locations.  Several revisions focused on clarifying the submission logic and handling of state updates within the form.  The `handleAddGST` function now directly uses Redux for updating or adding GST locations instead of modifying local state. The commented-out code suggests an earlier implementation using only local state before transitioning to Redux.

**GstCustomerLocation.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:17:19 AM & 9/10/2025, 11:52:21 AM):** This component displays and manages GST locations for a customer. It fetches data from both the API and Redux store, merging them to provide a complete view.  The code efficiently handles the merging of API and Redux data for GST locations.  The component also includes functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting GST locations.  The componentâ€™s structure has significantly improved with a cleaner separation of concerns and the introduction of a table for displaying GST Locations.

**vesselVoyagePopup.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:37:53 AM - 9/10/2025, 11:41:29 AM):**  This component presents a popup to select vessel voyage details. The initial version was named `GetCustomerPopup` and contained a grid layout. The name changed to `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup` and the layout was simplified to a single column. The `endpointKey` within `AutocompleteSearch` is corrected to be  `pol` instead of `gst-location` reflecting the intended data source.

**OverviewContainer.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:38:36 AM & 9/10/2025, 11:39:28 AM):** This component displays an overview of line bookings. A modal is implemented to show the `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup`.  The second timestamp indicates a change in the modal size from "2xl" to "xl".


**LineBookingForm.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:43:42 AM - 9/10/2025, 12:21:46 PM):** This component, responsible for creating/editing line booking forms, undergoes significant changes across many revisions.  These changes incorporate the data passed from the `vesselVoyagePopup`.  Initial versions are based on formik, but lacked a proper structure and integration. Then a table structure was added, and then it was completely changed to incorporate data from the vessel voyage selection, utilizing a table for line booking information, and adding more robust error handling. The final version utilizes a `PageWrapper` component for better layout management.  Furthermore, the logic for data fetching and integration with the `vesselVoyagePopup` component was refined several times before arriving at the final version.

**AddLineBookingForm.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:45:21 AM - 9/10/2025, 12:20:50 PM):** This component mirrors `LineBookingForm.tsx` in its structure and evolution, undergoing several revisions to improve the initial formik implementation and add features. The final version improved the form layout using `PageWrapper`, and uses autocomplete for POD and Line Name.   The `initialValues` for the form were refined to include  `booking_info` and `vessel_voyage_planned` in multiple revisions.  The final version uses `AutocompleteSearch` components for POD and Line Name fields, adding further refinement to the user interface.  The component also received styling and layout improvements using the `PageWrapper` component.


**App.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:57:57 AM):** This file defines the React Router routes for the application.  No significant structural changes, only additions of new routes for newly created components.


**line-booking-columns.tsx (9/10/2025, 12:15:30 PM - 9/10/2025, 12:16:15 PM):** This file defines column configurations for a line booking table. The width of certain columns are adjusted to improve the layout.


In summary, the codebase underwent significant improvements, particularly to the line booking forms, integrating a popup for vessel voyage selection and refining the form's data handling with formik and state management.  The customer GST location management also improved by merging data from the API and Redux.  Many revisions show iterative improvements to the components focusing on the user experience, data handling, and code clarity.


## 1:38:36 PM
The `LineBookingForm.tsx` component was updated on September 10, 2025, at 1:37:52 PM.  This component, a React functional component, is a form for managing line bookings.  Key updates include:

* **Improved UI:** The form's layout was enhanced using Tailwind CSS classes (`grid`, `border`, etc.) for better responsiveness and styling.  It now displays vessel/voyage details, ETA/ETD information, and a table for line booking entries.

* **Data Handling:**  The component uses `formik` for form management, `useState` for managing component state (selected ID, expansion state, pagination), and `useNavigate` for navigation. It fetches vessel data via `useLocation`.  Placeholder data (`PLANNED_VESSEL_VOYAGE_DATA`) is used, suggesting integration with a backend API is planned (indicated by comments in `onSubmit` suggesting calls to "add" and "edit" APIs).

* **Table Functionality:** A table displays line booking information, with editable rows implied by the presence of edit and delete icons.  The table currently shows static sample data; dynamic data loading is likely a future implementation.

* **Add Functionality:** A button allows adding new line bookings, navigating to a separate add line booking page (`/app/export/line_booking/add_line_booking`). The navigation also passes state including `vessel_voyage_id`.

* **Component Structure:** The component uses several custom components from the `@components` directory (e.g., `SelectBox`, `InputBox`, `Button`, `DynamicEditableTable`, `Card`, `AppGrid`, `Checkbox`, `Field`, `Label`, `Textarea`, `IconButton`), demonstrating modular design.  It also uses icons from `@heroicons/react` and `react-icons`.

In summary, the commit represents a significant update to the line booking form, focusing on UI improvements and setting the foundation for data integration and enhanced functionality.  The use of numerous custom components suggests a larger, well-structured application.


## 4:38:52 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the frontend code for a line booking system within the Envosyes application.  The changes span several files, primarily focusing on the components responsible for adding, editing, displaying, and managing line bookings.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` (9/10/2025, 1:43:58 PM):** This file defines the Redux slice for managing line booking data.  It includes reducers for setting vessel ID, adding, updating, and deleting line bookings, and resetting the booking state.  The data structure for `LineBooking` is established, including fields like `id`, `line_booking_no`, `bookingdate`, `pod`, `line_name`, `remarks`, `commodity`, and `equipments`.

**`store.ts` (9/10/2025, 1:44:47 PM):** This file configures the Redux store, combining various reducers including the `lineBookingSlice` reducer.  It also integrates middleware for API interactions (likely fetching and updating data).  Noteworthy is the inclusion of API reducers and middleware related to user, vessel, customer, and document data.

**`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component undergoes significant revisions throughout the log.  Initially, it's a more comprehensive form with various input fields, an editable table for equipment details, and auto-complete search functionality for POD and Line Name. Later revisions simplify the form's structure, using basic input components and removing some of the more advanced features seen in the earlier version.  The key change involves adding edit functionality; the component now handles both adding and updating line bookings depending on whether a booking object is passed in the `state` property via navigation.  The final version uses the `equipments` array consistently instead of `booking_info` which was initially used.


**`LineBookingForm.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component displays a list of line bookings and provides actions to add, edit, and delete them. It initially renders a static table; subsequent updates dynamically render line bookings from Redux store, incorporating edit and delete functionalities via icons and navigation.  The component also displays vessel and voyage information passed via the `state` property. The final version uses more concise conditional rendering for empty state and includes null checks for nullish values.

**`line-booking.types.ts` (Multiple Timestamps):** This file defines types used within the line booking system.  It defines interfaces for `LineBookingData`, `FilterState`, and `LineBookingFormValues`, which are repeatedly adjusted to reflect changes in the data structure and form field requirements.  The most significant change is in the `LineBookingFormValues` interface. Early versions include fields like `fcl`, `customer_name`, and `cfs_name`, which are later removed.  Also `booking_info` is renamed to `equipments` and itâ€™s type is changed.  The `vessel_id` and `pod_code` fields are added at different points in the evolution of the code.

**`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx` (9/10/2025, 2:28:01 PM):** This page acts as a container for the `LineBookingForm`, providing basic navigation and title.

**`action.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This file defines a function `getLineBookingActions` to generate menu items for actions related to Line Bookings.  These actions include edit, confirm, and cancel. The initial version conditionally displays the actions based on user access levels. Further changes refine icon selection, reduce redundancy, and consolidate the display of actions.  Lastly, the file makes the navigation paths more explicit, using `/app/export/line_booking/new_line_booking` instead of `/line-booking/edit` and `/line-booking/view`.

**`LineBookingDashboard.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component displays a dashboard for line bookings, including search, filtering, sorting, and export to Excel functionality. It uses `AppGrid` for displaying the data which is fetched from a dummy data source. The filter sidebar is introduced to allow filtering data by different attributes. The final version incorporates a confirm line booking popup.

**`data\coulms\line-booking-columns.tsx` (9/10/2025, 3:05:07 PM):** Defines the columns for the line booking dashboard grid and editable table.

**`confirmLineBookingPopup.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component is developed throughout the log.  It starts as a simple placeholder and evolves into a modal component with an input for "Delivery Order No" and a file upload section with drag-and-drop support.

In summary, the code undergoes a significant refactoring, particularly concerning form handling, data structures, and UI elements, resulting in a more streamlined and consistent line booking management interface. The addition of file upload in the ConfirmLineBookingPopup is a significant feature addition.  The use of Redux and Formik is evident throughout the code.


## 5:41:03 PM
The log shows a series of code changes on September 10, 2025, primarily focused on developing components related to customer management and line booking within a React application.

**`LineBookingForm.tsx` (4:39:16 PM):** This component displays and handles a form for managing line bookings.  It fetches vessel data, lists existing line bookings in a table with edit and delete functionalities, and allows adding new line bookings via a navigation to a dedicated 'add' page.  The component uses Redux for state management (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and Formik for form handling (`useFormik`).

**`vesselVoyagePopup.tsx` (4:39:57 PM):** A popup component for selecting vessel voyage details. It utilizes an autocomplete search (`AutocompleteSearch`) and Formik for managing form submission.  Upon submission, it navigates to a new line booking page, passing the selected vessel data.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` (4:40:36 PM):** A Redux slice managing the state of line bookings. It includes actions to set vessel ID, add, update, delete, and reset line bookings.  The data structure for a `LineBooking` includes nested `Equipment` objects.

**`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` (4:45:21 PM, 4:47:17 PM, 5:28:00 PM, 5:29:24 PM):**  This page initially renders a form for customer details, but undergoes several revisions.  The final version uses `CustomerGSTForm` to handle GST location information.  The component uses React Router's `useNavigate` for navigation.  Multiple updates show iterative development focusing on simplifying the component and its state management.  Significant changes include moving the entire component to only display `CustomerGSTForm` and restructuring the initial state of `customerData` to include GST location.

**`App.tsx` (4:45:46 PM, 4:46:16 PM, 4:47:42 PM):** The main application routing component.  It defines routes for various pages, including those related to customers, vessels, line bookings, and others.  A notable change (between the second and third timestamps) involves commenting out the route `master/customer/addNewCustomerForm`  and replacing it with `master/customer/addNewCustomerForm` which leads to the use of `CustomerDetailsForm` instead of `CustomerDetailsPage`.

**`GstCustomerLocation.tsx` (4:48:22 PM, 5:19:29 PM, 5:20:28 PM, 5:21:23 PM, 5:22:40 PM, 5:24:58 PM, 5:25:32 PM):** This component, responsible for managing GST locations for customers, has undergone extensive revision.  Initial versions used a direct Redux state update approach for GST Location information, however, this was changed to use formik for submission, simplifying the logic and removing direct manipulation of redux.  The logic to merge API data and Redux data has been removed and the component now solely relies on the redux state. It displays a table of GST locations, allowing addition and deletion through navigation.  The component uses Redux, React Router, and Formik.  Several iterations involved refinements in data merging, error handling, and form submission.  The final revision corrected the `initialValues` of the formik to be the `gstLocations` and removed the unnecessary redundant merge logic.

**`customerGstLocationSlice.ts` (5:00:52 PM):** A Redux slice for managing GST location data associated with customers. It provides actions to set customer data, add, update, delete, and reset GST locations.  The data structure for `GSTLocation` is defined here.

**`customer.types.ts` (5:27:09 PM, 5:28:48 PM):** This file defines TypeScript types for customer-related data.  Significant changes were made to the structure of `CustomerFormValues`, simplifying it to only include `customer_id` and `gstLocations`, which reflects the shift toward a more modular approach to customer data management.


In summary, the code changes reflect a significant refactoring effort focused on improving the customer management section of the application.  The changes involved shifting from a direct Redux state update to using Formik, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.  The focus is on the GST Location section of the Customer data with multiple revisions dedicated towards cleaning up redundant code. The timestamps indicate a period of intensive development and refinement over a short time frame.  A recurring theme is the use of React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, Formik for form handling, and a consistent UI pattern using tables and buttons for data interaction.


## 6:40:55 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `vesselVoyagePopup.tsx` and `optionService.ts`.

`vesselVoyagePopup.tsx` (9/10/2025, 6:13:39 PM): This file contains a React component, `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup`,  which uses Formik for form handling and `react-router-dom` for navigation.  The component includes an `AutocompleteSearch` component to select a vessel voyage,  and buttons for "Cancel" and "Next". Upon submission, it navigates to `/app/export/line_booking/new_line_booking` passing vessel data including a hardcoded `vessel_voyage_id` of 1.


`optionService.ts` underwent two modifications:

* **First Modification (9/10/2025, 6:22:00 PM):** This commit introduced a `normalizeOption` function to standardize options received from different sources. It handles three cases: already normalized objects, vessel/voyage type responses (using `vessel_name` and `voyage`), and a fallback case to handle missing values.  The function also uses `makeCapitalized` for label generation if necessary. Functions `normalizeOptions`, `getStaticOptions`, `fetchOptions`, and `getOptions` manage option fetching and normalization from API calls or statically defined options.


* **Second Modification (9/10/2025, 6:26:32 PM):**  This commit further refines the `normalizeOption` function. The key change is within the vessel/voyage response handling. Instead of displaying both `vessel_name` and `voyage` in the label, it now only shows the `voyage` in the dropdown while still retaining the complete `item` object as `raw`.  The fallback case now also adds the `raw` property to preserve the original data.


In summary, the changes primarily focus on improving data handling and presentation within the application's option selection components.  The `optionService.ts` file is designed to fetch and standardize data for use in auto-complete inputs, such as the vessel voyage selection in `vesselVoyagePopup.tsx`.  The second commit to `optionService.ts` specifically alters how vessel voyage data is displayed in the user interface.


## 6:41:03 PM
The log shows configuration changes for an Envosys backend application.  On September 10th, 2025, separate `.env` files were created for development and production environments (5:56 PM and 6:16 PM respectively).  These files contain environment variables defining settings like port, database credentials, and JWT secrets.  The `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` values differ between the environments (using "supersecretdev" in development and "supersecretprod" in production).  There's a notable inconsistency in the `DB_USER` variable in the production `.env` file; it was initially set to "Envosys_Database" and subsequently changed to "postgres" at 6:17 PM.


A `config.ts` file was updated at 6:16 PM to load environment variables based on the `NODE_ENV` variable.  This file reads settings from either `.env.development` or `.env.production` depending on the environment. The `config.ts` file also defines a `CONFIG` object which exposes these variables to the application,  and notably has commented-out lines related to Google credentials.  This suggests potential future integration with Google services.


## 7:40:53 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\searchOptions.ts` underwent two revisions on September 10th, 2025.  Both revisions involved the `getAll` function within the file, which handles autocomplete API requests. The core functionality remained consistent across both versions, retrieving data based on an `endpointKey` and `keyword` from the request query.

The primary difference between the two revisions lies in the `case` statement handling the `"vessel_voyage"` endpoint.  In the first revision (7:15:17 PM), the case was labeled `"vessel_voyage"`, while the second revision (7:19:50 PM) changed it to `"vessel-voyage"` (replacing the underscore with a hyphen).  No other significant code changes are apparent between the two versions; the rest of the code remained identical.  The changes appear to be a simple renaming of a case label within a switch statement.
