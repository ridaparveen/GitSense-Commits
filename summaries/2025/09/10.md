# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 12:14:40 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `uploadDocuments.ts` service file and the `multerConfig.ts` configuration file between September 9th, 2025, 11:16 PM and September 10th, 2025, 12:08 AM.  The changes revolve around document upload, retrieval, and deletion functionalities.

**`uploadDocuments.ts` Changes:**

The most significant changes occurred in `uploadDocuments.ts`. Initially, the `uploadDocument` function had unnecessary or commented-out code.  Over several edits (between 11:16 PM and 11:58 PM), the function was refined:

* **Removal of Unnecessary Parameters:** The `uploadDocument` function's request body parameters were gradually reduced, removing `ref_type` and `ref_id`  from the required parameters, simplifying the upload process.  The `remark` parameter was also removed completely.

* **Single File Upload:** The code was modified to handle single file uploads instead of multiple files (using `upload.single("file")` in `index.ts` instead of `upload.array("files", 10)`), reflecting in the changes made to `uploadDocument` function between 11:35 PM and 11:56 PM.

* **Original Filename:** The code was changed to use `req.file.originalname` for storing the original filename in the database.  This improved the accuracy of file name storage.

* **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling was maintained throughout, using `HttpError` and logging errors using the `logger` utility.

* **File Path Adjustment:** The logic for extracting the document path was adjusted, possibly to reflect a change in the upload directory structure and this was done between 11:46 PM and 11:58 PM.

The `fetchUploadedDocuments`, `deleteDocument`, and `downloadDocument` functions remained largely unchanged throughout the log entries, demonstrating stability in these areas.  The `fetchUploadedDocuments` function constructs download links using `${process.env.BACKEND_BASE_URL}`, which implies the use of environment variables for the base URL.


**`multerConfig.ts` Changes:**

A key change happened in `multerConfig.ts` at 12:08 AM on September 10th.  This involved creating the upload directory ("envosys_uploads") programmatically within the `multerConfig.ts` file itself, ensuring its existence before file uploads. This improves robustness by proactively handling missing directory issues. The filename generation was also simplified to use the original filename with a timestamp.


**Overall Pattern:**

The edits to `uploadDocuments.ts` show an iterative refinement process, focusing on streamlining the upload function and improving the accuracy of information stored.  The change in `multerConfig.ts`  suggests a proactive approach to improve the reliability of the file upload mechanism.  The overall process demonstrates a debugging and improvement cycle.


## 12:14:46 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the Envosys frontend, primarily focused on enhancing document upload functionality.

**`ApiEndPoint.ts`**: This file defines API endpoints.  A significant change (10:45:40 PM) simplifies the `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` endpoint, removing the FormData appending logic from the endpoint definition itself and leaving it solely to the ApiManager.

**`ApiManager.ts`**: This file manages API calls. It was updated (10:45:22 PM) to include methods for login, fetching common and global options, and uploading documents.  The `uploadDocument` method constructs a FormData object and uses it to make a POST request. A commented-out section suggests that user settings retrieval functionality existed earlier but was removed.

**`uploadDocumentApi.ts`**: This file uses Redux Toolkit's `createApi` to define API slices for document management.  Multiple updates occurred between 10:48:03 PM and 10:48:14 PM, primarily removing unused imports and reducing the number of exported hooks.  A later change (11:09:47 PM) updates the upload endpoint URL to `/api/upload-documents`, indicating a possible change to the backend API.  The crucial modification here is removing manual setting of "Content-Type" header in the `uploadDocument` mutation query, allowing `fetchBaseQuery` to handle it correctly for FormData.


**`store/store.ts`**: This file configures the Redux store.  It was updated (10:49:09 PM) to include the `uploadDocumentApi` reducer and middleware.

**`UploadFiles.tsx`**: This component handles file uploads.  The most significant changes involved refining the file upload process. Initially, it attempted to upload only a single file.  Subsequent modifications  (between 11:00:56 PM and 11:54:14 PM)  introduced support for multiple file uploads within each row, improved error handling, and streamlined the UI.  The final version (11:54:14 PM) refactors the code to allow for a single file upload per row, uses a separate upload button,  and implements a visual indicator to show which row is currently uploading. The key change is making the `UploadDocument` interface in `customer.types.ts` accept an array of files instead of a single file, which allows for multiple file uploads. The upload button only becomes enabled when a file is selected.  Finally, the upload happens after file selection, instead of after button click.

**`customer.types.ts`**:  The `UploadDocument` interface in this file, defining the structure for uploaded documents, was modified (between 11:41:17 PM and 11:42:22 PM) to include a `file?: File` property, allowing for optional File objects to be stored along with the document metadata.  This is directly related to the `UploadFiles.tsx` component's enhancement to support multiple files.

The overall pattern across the changes demonstrates a shift from a single-file upload system to one supporting multiple files per upload operation, along with improvements to the user interface and error handling.  The majority of updates occurred between 10:44 PM and 11:54 PM on September 9th, 2025, with a final minor update at 12:02 AM on September 10th, 2025.


## 10:38:25 AM
The log shows changes to the backend routing (`index.ts`) and multer configuration (`multerConfig.ts`) files on September 10, 2025.

`index.ts` (9:53:37 AM): This file defines the API router, incorporating authentication (`AuthRoutes`), master routes (`MasterRoutes`), and a search endpoint (`getAll`).  Import statements for a shipment route and file upload (`multerConfig`) are commented out, suggesting these features may have been temporarily disabled or removed.


`multerConfig.ts` (9:54:28 AM): This file configures multer for file uploads. It creates a directory (`envosys_uploads`) for storing uploaded files, handling file naming using timestamps, and includes a file filter to restrict uploads to JPEG, PNG, and PDF files. The creation of the upload directory is handled programmatically, ensuring it exists before accepting uploads.  The close proximity of timestamps suggests these changes may be related; potentially the commented-out upload functionality in `index.ts` relates to the newly configured multer setup.


## 12:38:52 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a React frontend application, primarily focused on customer and line booking functionalities.

**ApiEndPoint.ts (9/10/2025, 9:56:37 AM):** This file defines API endpoints for login and autocomplete functionalities.  The `LOGIN` endpoint is a simple `/temp-auth/login` route, while `GET_COMMON_OPTIONS` constructs a query string for autocomplete based on provided `name` and `search` parameters.

**ApiManager.ts (9/10/2025, 9:57:09 AM):** This file uses the endpoints defined in `ApiEndPoint.ts` to create an `ApiManager` class. This class provides `login` and `getCommonOptions` static methods that handle HTTP requests using a presumed `ApiMethods` class (not shown in the log). The `login` method accepts a `LoginPayload` interface with username, password, and other optional fields.

**customer-columns.tsx (9/10/2025, 10:36:11 AM & 9/10/2025, 11:04:26 AM):** This file defines column configurations for a table, likely used to display customer data.  Multiple constant arrays (`GstDetailsColumn`, `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn`, `AlertMappingColumn`, `facDetailsColumn`) specify column keys, header names, widths, and data types (text, select, date, autosearch). The second timestamp reflects the addition of `options` to the `facDetailsColumn`, providing example options for 'Country' and 'City' selections.

**CreditControl.tsx (9/10/2025, 10:39:11 AM - 9/10/2025, 10:49:40 AM):** This component renders a form with expandable sections for credit control details.  Multiple revisions involved refining the handling of dropdown changes within the formik form structure to correctly update field values.  The final version uses a defined `pdcOptions` constant for cleaner code.


**CustomerDetailsForm.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:08:45 AM - 9/10/2025, 11:15:43 AM):**  This component handles form submission for customer details. It fetches customer data using RTK Query and dispatches Redux actions (`addGST`, `updateGST`) to manage GST locations.  Several revisions focused on clarifying the submission logic and handling of state updates within the form.  The `handleAddGST` function now directly uses Redux for updating or adding GST locations instead of modifying local state. The commented-out code suggests an earlier implementation using only local state before transitioning to Redux.

**GstCustomerLocation.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:17:19 AM & 9/10/2025, 11:52:21 AM):** This component displays and manages GST locations for a customer. It fetches data from both the API and Redux store, merging them to provide a complete view.  The code efficiently handles the merging of API and Redux data for GST locations.  The component also includes functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting GST locations.  The componentâ€™s structure has significantly improved with a cleaner separation of concerns and the introduction of a table for displaying GST Locations.

**vesselVoyagePopup.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:37:53 AM - 9/10/2025, 11:41:29 AM):**  This component presents a popup to select vessel voyage details. The initial version was named `GetCustomerPopup` and contained a grid layout. The name changed to `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup` and the layout was simplified to a single column. The `endpointKey` within `AutocompleteSearch` is corrected to be  `pol` instead of `gst-location` reflecting the intended data source.

**OverviewContainer.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:38:36 AM & 9/10/2025, 11:39:28 AM):** This component displays an overview of line bookings. A modal is implemented to show the `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup`.  The second timestamp indicates a change in the modal size from "2xl" to "xl".


**LineBookingForm.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:43:42 AM - 9/10/2025, 12:21:46 PM):** This component, responsible for creating/editing line booking forms, undergoes significant changes across many revisions.  These changes incorporate the data passed from the `vesselVoyagePopup`.  Initial versions are based on formik, but lacked a proper structure and integration. Then a table structure was added, and then it was completely changed to incorporate data from the vessel voyage selection, utilizing a table for line booking information, and adding more robust error handling. The final version utilizes a `PageWrapper` component for better layout management.  Furthermore, the logic for data fetching and integration with the `vesselVoyagePopup` component was refined several times before arriving at the final version.

**AddLineBookingForm.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:45:21 AM - 9/10/2025, 12:20:50 PM):** This component mirrors `LineBookingForm.tsx` in its structure and evolution, undergoing several revisions to improve the initial formik implementation and add features. The final version improved the form layout using `PageWrapper`, and uses autocomplete for POD and Line Name.   The `initialValues` for the form were refined to include  `booking_info` and `vessel_voyage_planned` in multiple revisions.  The final version uses `AutocompleteSearch` components for POD and Line Name fields, adding further refinement to the user interface.  The component also received styling and layout improvements using the `PageWrapper` component.


**App.tsx (9/10/2025, 11:57:57 AM):** This file defines the React Router routes for the application.  No significant structural changes, only additions of new routes for newly created components.


**line-booking-columns.tsx (9/10/2025, 12:15:30 PM - 9/10/2025, 12:16:15 PM):** This file defines column configurations for a line booking table. The width of certain columns are adjusted to improve the layout.


In summary, the codebase underwent significant improvements, particularly to the line booking forms, integrating a popup for vessel voyage selection and refining the form's data handling with formik and state management.  The customer GST location management also improved by merging data from the API and Redux.  Many revisions show iterative improvements to the components focusing on the user experience, data handling, and code clarity.
