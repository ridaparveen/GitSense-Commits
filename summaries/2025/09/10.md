# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 12:14:40 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `uploadDocuments.ts` service file and the `multerConfig.ts` configuration file between September 9th, 2025, 11:16 PM and September 10th, 2025, 12:08 AM.  The changes revolve around document upload, retrieval, and deletion functionalities.

**`uploadDocuments.ts` Changes:**

The most significant changes occurred in `uploadDocuments.ts`. Initially, the `uploadDocument` function had unnecessary or commented-out code.  Over several edits (between 11:16 PM and 11:58 PM), the function was refined:

* **Removal of Unnecessary Parameters:** The `uploadDocument` function's request body parameters were gradually reduced, removing `ref_type` and `ref_id`  from the required parameters, simplifying the upload process.  The `remark` parameter was also removed completely.

* **Single File Upload:** The code was modified to handle single file uploads instead of multiple files (using `upload.single("file")` in `index.ts` instead of `upload.array("files", 10)`), reflecting in the changes made to `uploadDocument` function between 11:35 PM and 11:56 PM.

* **Original Filename:** The code was changed to use `req.file.originalname` for storing the original filename in the database.  This improved the accuracy of file name storage.

* **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling was maintained throughout, using `HttpError` and logging errors using the `logger` utility.

* **File Path Adjustment:** The logic for extracting the document path was adjusted, possibly to reflect a change in the upload directory structure and this was done between 11:46 PM and 11:58 PM.

The `fetchUploadedDocuments`, `deleteDocument`, and `downloadDocument` functions remained largely unchanged throughout the log entries, demonstrating stability in these areas.  The `fetchUploadedDocuments` function constructs download links using `${process.env.BACKEND_BASE_URL}`, which implies the use of environment variables for the base URL.


**`multerConfig.ts` Changes:**

A key change happened in `multerConfig.ts` at 12:08 AM on September 10th.  This involved creating the upload directory ("envosys_uploads") programmatically within the `multerConfig.ts` file itself, ensuring its existence before file uploads. This improves robustness by proactively handling missing directory issues. The filename generation was also simplified to use the original filename with a timestamp.


**Overall Pattern:**

The edits to `uploadDocuments.ts` show an iterative refinement process, focusing on streamlining the upload function and improving the accuracy of information stored.  The change in `multerConfig.ts`  suggests a proactive approach to improve the reliability of the file upload mechanism.  The overall process demonstrates a debugging and improvement cycle.


## 12:14:46 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the Envosys frontend, primarily focused on enhancing document upload functionality.

**`ApiEndPoint.ts`**: This file defines API endpoints.  A significant change (10:45:40 PM) simplifies the `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` endpoint, removing the FormData appending logic from the endpoint definition itself and leaving it solely to the ApiManager.

**`ApiManager.ts`**: This file manages API calls. It was updated (10:45:22 PM) to include methods for login, fetching common and global options, and uploading documents.  The `uploadDocument` method constructs a FormData object and uses it to make a POST request. A commented-out section suggests that user settings retrieval functionality existed earlier but was removed.

**`uploadDocumentApi.ts`**: This file uses Redux Toolkit's `createApi` to define API slices for document management.  Multiple updates occurred between 10:48:03 PM and 10:48:14 PM, primarily removing unused imports and reducing the number of exported hooks.  A later change (11:09:47 PM) updates the upload endpoint URL to `/api/upload-documents`, indicating a possible change to the backend API.  The crucial modification here is removing manual setting of "Content-Type" header in the `uploadDocument` mutation query, allowing `fetchBaseQuery` to handle it correctly for FormData.


**`store/store.ts`**: This file configures the Redux store.  It was updated (10:49:09 PM) to include the `uploadDocumentApi` reducer and middleware.

**`UploadFiles.tsx`**: This component handles file uploads.  The most significant changes involved refining the file upload process. Initially, it attempted to upload only a single file.  Subsequent modifications  (between 11:00:56 PM and 11:54:14 PM)  introduced support for multiple file uploads within each row, improved error handling, and streamlined the UI.  The final version (11:54:14 PM) refactors the code to allow for a single file upload per row, uses a separate upload button,  and implements a visual indicator to show which row is currently uploading. The key change is making the `UploadDocument` interface in `customer.types.ts` accept an array of files instead of a single file, which allows for multiple file uploads. The upload button only becomes enabled when a file is selected.  Finally, the upload happens after file selection, instead of after button click.

**`customer.types.ts`**:  The `UploadDocument` interface in this file, defining the structure for uploaded documents, was modified (between 11:41:17 PM and 11:42:22 PM) to include a `file?: File` property, allowing for optional File objects to be stored along with the document metadata.  This is directly related to the `UploadFiles.tsx` component's enhancement to support multiple files.

The overall pattern across the changes demonstrates a shift from a single-file upload system to one supporting multiple files per upload operation, along with improvements to the user interface and error handling.  The majority of updates occurred between 10:44 PM and 11:54 PM on September 9th, 2025, with a final minor update at 12:02 AM on September 10th, 2025.
