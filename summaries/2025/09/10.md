# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 12:14:40 AM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `uploadDocuments.ts` service file and the `multerConfig.ts` configuration file between September 9th, 2025, 11:16 PM and September 10th, 2025, 12:08 AM.  The changes revolve around document upload, retrieval, and deletion functionalities.

**`uploadDocuments.ts` Changes:**

The most significant changes occurred in `uploadDocuments.ts`. Initially, the `uploadDocument` function had unnecessary or commented-out code.  Over several edits (between 11:16 PM and 11:58 PM), the function was refined:

* **Removal of Unnecessary Parameters:** The `uploadDocument` function's request body parameters were gradually reduced, removing `ref_type` and `ref_id`  from the required parameters, simplifying the upload process.  The `remark` parameter was also removed completely.

* **Single File Upload:** The code was modified to handle single file uploads instead of multiple files (using `upload.single("file")` in `index.ts` instead of `upload.array("files", 10)`), reflecting in the changes made to `uploadDocument` function between 11:35 PM and 11:56 PM.

* **Original Filename:** The code was changed to use `req.file.originalname` for storing the original filename in the database.  This improved the accuracy of file name storage.

* **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling was maintained throughout, using `HttpError` and logging errors using the `logger` utility.

* **File Path Adjustment:** The logic for extracting the document path was adjusted, possibly to reflect a change in the upload directory structure and this was done between 11:46 PM and 11:58 PM.

The `fetchUploadedDocuments`, `deleteDocument`, and `downloadDocument` functions remained largely unchanged throughout the log entries, demonstrating stability in these areas.  The `fetchUploadedDocuments` function constructs download links using `${process.env.BACKEND_BASE_URL}`, which implies the use of environment variables for the base URL.


**`multerConfig.ts` Changes:**

A key change happened in `multerConfig.ts` at 12:08 AM on September 10th.  This involved creating the upload directory ("envosys_uploads") programmatically within the `multerConfig.ts` file itself, ensuring its existence before file uploads. This improves robustness by proactively handling missing directory issues. The filename generation was also simplified to use the original filename with a timestamp.


**Overall Pattern:**

The edits to `uploadDocuments.ts` show an iterative refinement process, focusing on streamlining the upload function and improving the accuracy of information stored.  The change in `multerConfig.ts`  suggests a proactive approach to improve the reliability of the file upload mechanism.  The overall process demonstrates a debugging and improvement cycle.
