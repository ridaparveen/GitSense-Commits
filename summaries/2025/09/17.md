# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 11:14:47 AM
The primary file modified, `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\lineBookingSlice.ts`, on 9/17/2025 at 11:14:15 AM, is a Redux slice managing line bookings.  It defines reducers for various actions: `addList` (adds a new line booking, generating a unique serial ID if not in edit mode), `updateList` (updates an existing line booking), `removeList` (removes a line booking), `resetLineBooking` (resets the entire state), `clearBookings` (clears the line bookings array), `setLineBookings` (sets the line bookings and vessel voyage ID), `setVesselVoyageId` (sets the vessel voyage ID), and `initializeNewBookingSession` (initializes a new booking session).  The code uses a unique identifier, often `serial_id`, to manage and update items in the `line_bookings` array.  A significant portion of the code is focused on managing and updating the `serial_id` field for UI consistency across add, update, and delete operations.  The `idField` parameter provides flexibility in specifying the ID field if it's not `serial_id`.
