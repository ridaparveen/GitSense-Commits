# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 11:14:47 AM
The primary file modified, `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\lineBookingSlice.ts`, on 9/17/2025 at 11:14:15 AM, is a Redux slice managing line bookings.  It defines reducers for various actions: `addList` (adds a new line booking, generating a unique serial ID if not in edit mode), `updateList` (updates an existing line booking), `removeList` (removes a line booking), `resetLineBooking` (resets the entire state), `clearBookings` (clears the line bookings array), `setLineBookings` (sets the line bookings and vessel voyage ID), `setVesselVoyageId` (sets the vessel voyage ID), and `initializeNewBookingSession` (initializes a new booking session).  The code uses a unique identifier, often `serial_id`, to manage and update items in the `line_bookings` array.  A significant portion of the code is focused on managing and updating the `serial_id` field for UI consistency across add, update, and delete operations.  The `idField` parameter provides flexibility in specifying the ID field if it's not `serial_id`.


## 12:14:29 PM
The `linebookingService.ts` file, updated on September 17, 2025, at 11:40:59 AM,  defines services for managing line bookings.  Key functionalities include creating, retrieving, and updating line bookings, along with their associated equipment.

The `create` function inserts new line bookings into the `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables. It uses transactions (`BEGIN` and `COMMIT`) to ensure data consistency and checks for existing bookings with the same `line_booking_no`.

The `getAll` function retrieves all line bookings, applying pagination and filtering based on various parameters (page number, status, dates, location codes, line name, and order).  It dynamically constructs SQL queries using a `QueryBuilder` class, efficiently fetching data and including related equipment details.  The query is logged using a logger.

The `getByVesselVoyageId` function retrieves line bookings associated with a specific vessel voyage ID, including equipment information.

The `update` function handles both updates and insertions of line bookings. If a `serial_id` is provided in the request body, it updates the existing record in `line_booking_master` and replaces the associated equipment in `line_booking_equipments`. Otherwise, it creates a new line booking. Transaction management ensures data integrity during updates.  A commented-out section suggests previous logic for mandatory `serial_id` in update requests, which was possibly removed or altered in this commit.

Throughout the code,  `query` and `insertQuery` functions are used extensively for database interactions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  The code uses `moment.js` for date manipulation. A common pattern is the retrieval of line booking equipment details via separate queries after fetching main booking details.


## 12:14:53 PM
The log shows numerous updates to the `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` files between 11:16 AM and 12:12 PM on September 17, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on managing line booking data within a Redux store and its corresponding form.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` Changes:**

The `lineBookingSlice.ts` file underwent several iterations, all revolving around the `addList` reducer.  Initial versions assigned temporary `serial_id`s based on array index,  handling edit mode inconsistently. Later versions improved this by:

*   **11:37 AM:**  Refined `serial_id` assignment logic.  The reducer now preserves existing `serial_id`s from the database while assigning temporary IDs only for new entries in add mode.
*   **11:46 AM:** Introduced a `temp_id` field to differentiate temporary client-side IDs from actual database `serial_id`s.
*   **12:01 AM - 12:12 PM:** The `temp_id` assignment logic was simplified and improved for better clarity and accuracy. The final version removes the need for `isEditMode` in the `addList` reducer, making it more concise.  A minor syntax error (`|| ,`) was also corrected in the final update.  The ultimate simplification resulted in assigning `serial_id` directly to the next available number based on current length.



**`LineBookingForm.tsx` Changes:**

The `LineBookingForm.tsx` file's updates are closely tied to the `lineBookingSlice` changes.  The initial versions had a `cleanedBookings` function to remove or modify `serial_id` before API calls.  This was to ensure temporary IDs didn't interfere with database operations.

*   **11:17 AM - 11:18 AM:**  Added `console.log` statements for debugging purposes. These were likely added to track the data flow within the component, particularly focusing on how the `initialValues` and `booking` properties were handled during edit mode.
*   **11:23 AM - 11:38 AM:** The `cleanedBookings` function was initially commented out, then modified to handle removing the `serial_id` from new rows only.
*   **11:47 AM - 11:49 AM:** Further refined `cleanedBookings`. The function now also removes the temporary `temp_id` field before sending data to the API.
*   **11:58 AM - 12:02 PM - 12:06 PM:** The  `cleanedBookings` function was replaced by  `getChangedOrNewBookings` function. This function efficiently identifies only the new or modified bookings to be sent during an update operation, improving efficiency. This change ensures only necessary data is sent to the backend, optimizing update requests and preventing unnecessary overwrites.  The final version removed unnecessary console logs to clean up the code.

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a continuous effort towards more efficient and robust handling of line booking data, particularly concerning the management of temporary and persistent IDs during both adding and updating entries.  The debugging statements and function refinements highlight an iterative development approach focused on improving data integrity and performance.


## 1:14:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` on September 17, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the `addList` reducer within `lineBookingSlice.ts`.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` Updates:**

The `addList` reducer underwent significant revisions between 12:15 PM and 12:38 PM.  Initially, it assigned temporary IDs (`temp_id`) to all new rows.  Subsequent changes refined this logic to handle both add and edit modes more effectively.  The final version distinguishes between adding new rows (assigning serial IDs) and updating existing rows (preserving serial IDs).  A `temp_id` is only assigned to new rows added in edit mode. The addition of `console.log` statements at 12:31 PM and 12:33 PM suggests debugging efforts.  The comments in the code were also updated to better reflect the logic of the `addList` reducer, changing from `âœ…` to `ðŸŸ¢` to mark the changes.

**`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` Updates:**

This file, updated at 12:31 PM, is a React component for adding/editing line bookings.  It uses Formik for form management and dispatches `addList` and `updateList` actions to the Redux store based on whether the form is in add or edit mode. The component integrates with an autocomplete search for POL, POD, and Line Name.  It also includes a dynamic editable table for managing equipment details. A key change involves handling the dispatch of `addList` and `updateList` based on the existence of a `serial_id` indicating whether an update or an add is occurring.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   The consistent use of `serial_id` and `temp_id` to manage unique identification of line booking entries within the frontend.
*   The Redux toolkit `createSlice` is used for managing the line booking state effectively.
*   The extensive use of comments within the code to clarify logic and intent.
*   The use of Formik and React components for building the UI and handling user interaction, including autocomplete suggestions.

The changes demonstrate an iterative development process where the `addList` reducer's logic was refined to handle different scenarios (add, edit, new rows during edits) more robustly. The `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` component is tightly coupled with this reducer, reflecting a well-integrated frontend and backend state management system.


## 2:14:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `lineBookingSlice.ts` between 2:02 PM and 2:13 PM on September 17, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a form for adding or editing line bookings, which interacts with a Redux store (`lineBookingSlice`) to manage the booking data.

**`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` Changes:**

The `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` file underwent several minor revisions, primarily focused on the `onSubmit` handler within the `useFormik` hook.  These changes center around how the application handles updating existing bookings versus adding new ones.

* **Initial Version (2:02 PM):**  The `onSubmit` handler dispatched either `addList` or `updateList` based on edit mode.  In edit mode, it attempted to find the booking by `serial_id` within the Redux store. If the booking was not found, it logged an error and proceeded to add it as a new entry, ignoring the original `serial_id`.

* **Subsequent Revisions (2:04 PM - 2:13 PM):**  The key change involves improved handling of update actions.  The code was refined to correctly handle scenarios where a booking is being updated, but the `serial_id` might not be present in the Redux store temporarily. A `cleanBooking` object was introduced (2:04 PM) to remove the `serial_id` before dispatching the update to prevent errors and ensure that only necessary data is added or updated. Then,the `cleanBooking` object was removed, and directly adding the `bookingData` to the `addList` function  (2:13 PM). The unnecessary `console.log` statement was also removed.  The `isEditMode` flag is now consistently passed to the `addList` action for better clarity (2:12 PM and later revisions).


**`lineBookingSlice.ts` Changes:**

The `lineBookingSlice.ts` file also saw revisions, primarily to the `addList` reducer.

* **Initial Version (2:05 PM):** The reducer handled adding and updating list items.  For new items, it assigned a `serial_id` locally. For updates, if the `serial_id` was absent, a temporary `temp_id` was used.

* **Later Version (2:09 PM):** A very minor change was made in the `addList` reducer where the `console.log` statement now logs the entire action object instead of just `action.payload`. This change does not affect core functionality.


**Overall Pattern:**

The revisions show a clear focus on improving the robustness and accuracy of the application's data handling, particularly in the context of updating existing line bookings in the Redux store. The changes aim to make the data handling more efficient and less prone to errors, dealing with potential inconsistencies between the frontend state and the backend data.


## 3:14:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` between 2:14 PM and 3:11 PM on September 17, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the data handling and submission logic for line bookings within a React application using Redux and Formik.


`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`:  The most significant changes involve the `onSubmit` handler. Initially, it used a complex conditional logic based on `isEditMode` and the existence of `booking.serial_id` to determine whether to dispatch `addList` or `updateList` Redux actions. Later revisions simplified this to directly use `dispatch(updateList)` for edit mode and `dispatch(addList)` for add mode, relying on the presence or absence of `bookingData.serial_id`.  A final refinement checks for existing bookings in the Redux store (`store.getState().lineBookingSlice.line_bookings`) using either `serial_id` or a temporary `temp_id`, ensuring updates are applied correctly even without a pre-existing `serial_id`. The validationSchema and enableReinitialize options were removed in some commits, and later added back. Some commented-out code related to error handling was also observed in later revisions.


`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This component underwent substantial changes to its `onSubmit` handler, aligning with the improvements in `AddLineBookingForm.tsx`. The new logic distinguishes between "add" and "edit" form actions. For "add," temporary IDs are removed before sending data to the API. For "edit," it separates new entries from updated existing entries, sending only the changed data to the API.  A `getChangedOrNewBookings` function was added to filter out unchanged bookings in edit mode. The initial commits of `LineBookingForm.tsx` contained several console.log statements for debugging. The later commits removed commented-out code and corrected some logic errors regarding which data to send in the API calls.  A final change adds a console.log statement within the handleDelete function to log the ID being deleted.

`lineBookingSlice.ts`: The Redux slice handling line bookings was also updated. The `addList` reducer was simplified to always add new data with a `temp_id`, regardless of edit mode. The `removeList` reducer now reassigns sequential `serial_id` values after removal, removing the temporary `temp_id`.  The `isEditMode` parameter was removed from the addList reducer.



The overall pattern in the code changes shows a shift towards a cleaner, more efficient, and less error-prone approach to handling data persistence and updates within the application.  The multiple revisions suggest an iterative development process involving debugging and refinement of the data flow.  The frequent commenting and uncommenting of code sections also point to exploration and adjustment of different strategies for handling updates.


## 4:14:26 PM
The file `linebookingService.ts` underwent two revisions on September 17, 2025.  The key change between the two commits was a correction in the `getAll` function.  Initially, the `page` parameter in the `getAll` function defaulted to `0` (3:53:06 PM). This was subsequently corrected to default to `1` (3:54:01 PM).  No other functional changes were made in the code between the two commits.  The code primarily deals with managing line bookings, interacting with a database (`line_booking_master`, `line_booking_equipments`) using functions like `insertQuery` and `query`.  It includes functions for creating, retrieving (with pagination and filtering options), getting by vessel voyage ID, and updating line bookings.  The code handles database transactions using `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements and includes error handling with rollback functionality. The code uses `moment.js` for date formatting and a custom `QueryBuilder` class.  Both versions extensively use SQL queries to manage line bookings and their associated equipment.


## 4:15:01 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` component and the `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `lineBookingDashboardSlice.ts` reducers.  The `LineBookingDashboard.tsx` component also undergoes significant changes related to pagination and data fetching.

**`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` (9/17/2025, 3:15:47 PM - 9/17/2025, 3:29:21 PM):**  This component, a React functional component for adding and editing line bookings, was modified several times. Key changes include:

* **Initial values handling:** The initial values for the formik object were refined to handle both add and edit modes more robustly, including managing equipment data and using a temporary ID (`temp_id`) for new bookings.
* **Redux interaction:** The way the component interacts with Redux improved.  Initially, it used `formAction` to determine whether to dispatch `addList` or `updateList`, later changing to directly check for the existence of the booking in the Redux store, regardless of the formAction. This ensures accurate updates even if the serial_id isn't yet available.
* **Temporary IDs:** The addition of `temp_id` in the `bookingData` object for new entries ensures unique identification in the Redux store until a server-generated `serial_id` is available.  This `temp_id` is generated using a timestamp.
* **Type safety:**  Explicit typing for `bookingData` is added which improves code clarity and maintainability.
* **Minor Changes:**  The `validationSchema` was commented out, and there was no substantial difference in the UI related code between revisions.


**`lineBookingSlice.ts` (9/17/2025, 3:31:07 PM - 9/17/2025, 3:31:37 PM):** The `lineBookingSlice` reducer is updated primarily to handle the `serial_id` management in the Redux store.  A significant change was introduced in the `removeList` reducer. Initially, it only removed the specified row without modifying the `serial_id` of other entries. The later revision adds a line to reassign sequential `serial_id`'s to the remaining entries after removal, potentially impacting edit mode behavior.

**`LineBookingDashboard.tsx` (9/17/2025, 3:34:26 PM - 9/17/2025, 4:11:54 PM):** This component, responsible for displaying a dashboard of line bookings, saw extensive revisions, mainly focusing on pagination and data fetching:

* **Pagination:** Initial versions had a fixed paginationModel.  Later, the component incorporated `paginationModel`  into the `useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery` to allow server-side pagination.   An useEffect hook was added to synchronize the component's local pagination state with the data received from the API.  The `onPageChange` handler was modified to update the Redux store's pagination state using `lineBookingDashboardSetPagination` instead of directly manipulating the component's state.
* **Data Fetching:**  The API call (`useFetchLineBookingDashboardDataQuery`) was modified to include pagination parameters (`page` and `perPage`), allowing fetching data in batches from the backend. The `page` parameter is incremented before sending it to the backend to handle 1-based indexing.
* **Data Update:**  The method of dynamically updating the `paginationModel` based on `lineBookingDashboardData.pagination` was implemented using `useEffect` hook, ensuring the frontend pagination state is synchronized with backend changes.
* **Search and Filtering:**  The component has a search function and includes various filters, dynamically creating filter options based on the fetched data, but the core logic for search and filter application remained unchanged.

**`lineBookingDashboardSlice.ts` (9/17/2025, 4:01:47 PM - 9/17/2025, 4:05:25 PM):**  The `lineBookingDashboardSlice` reducer is updated to consistently use `pageSize` instead of `perPage` for better naming convention.


**`datagrid.tsx` (9/17/2025, 4:04:21 PM - 9/17/2025, 4:04:53 PM):** The `AppGrid` component, a custom data grid, was updated to reflect the change from `perPage` to `pageSize` in the pagination model, ensuring consistency with the `lineBookingDashboardSlice` reducer.  This component is primarily for rendering the datagrid which doesn't change throughout the revisions.


In summary, the codebase underwent a series of refinements improving data management and the handling of pagination in the line booking feature.  The most significant changes focus on correctly managing temporary and permanent IDs in the Redux store, implementing server-side pagination for better performance and enhancing type safety.


## 5:15:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files related to line booking management and vessel details.  The most significant changes occur within `LineBookingDashboard.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx`.

`LineBookingDashboard.tsx` underwent three revisions between 4:15 PM and 4:18 PM on September 17th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistentâ€”displaying a dashboard for line bookings, including filtering, sorting, searching, exporting to Excel, and actions for confirming/canceling/viewing bookings. The changes primarily involved refinements to the search functionality (specifically the integration of `debounce` from `lodash` to improve performance) and minor adjustments to data logging within the component.  A notable change in the last revision was the addition of `console.log("lineBookingDashboardData", lineBookingDashboardData?.data);`  This suggests debugging efforts related to the `lineBookingDashboardData` object.


`LineBookingForm.tsx`  underwent two revisions between 4:17 PM and 4:19 PM on September 17th, 2025. This component handles adding and editing line bookings.  The key modification was a simplification of the `onSubmit` function within the `useFormik` hook. The original version contained more complex logic for handling edits, involving  separating new and modified entries. The revised version uses a more concise `getChangedOrNewBookings` helper function to identify and send only the changed or new bookings to the API. This simplifies the code and improves maintainability. The use of `toast` for user feedback (success and error messages) remained consistent.


`AddLineBookingForm.tsx` (4:17 PM on September 17th, 2025) shows a form for adding/editing line bookings. This component uses Formik for form management and includes fields for various booking details, along with a dynamic table for equipment details. It uses Redux to manage the list of line bookings.


`LineBookingSlice.ts` (4:20 PM on September 17th, 2025) is a Redux slice managing the state of line bookings. It includes actions for adding, updating, removing, resetting, and setting line booking data.


`VesselDetailsPage.tsx` had two revisions at 5:06 PM and 5:11 PM on September 17th, 2025. This page displays and allows editing vessel details.  The main change between revisions was the removal of a conditional check (`if (data?.data.status === "success")`) in the `handleSubmit` function after submitting vessel data. The navigation to the vessel list page now happens unconditionally after the successful submission of the form. This likely reflects a simplification of the success handling logic.


## 6:14:23 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `linebookingService.ts` and `vesselService.ts` files, along with related route and path definitions.  The most significant changes occur between 4:28 PM and 4:29 PM on September 17, 2025, in `linebookingService.ts`. This involves modifications to the `update` function,  likely adding or refining the functionality for handling both insertion and update modes for line bookings. The changes between 5:16 PM and 5:18 PM relate to renaming  `MasterRoutes` to `VesselRoutes` in `vesselRoutes.ts` and updating the corresponding paths in `Paths.ts` from  `Paths.Master` to `Paths.Vessel`. The `vesselService.ts` file undergoes multiple revisions (5:32 PM, 5:35 PM, 5:39 PM, 5:44 PM) primarily refining the `getVessel` and `saveVessel` functions and introducing a `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class to improve database query construction. This class enhances query building capabilities by adding search, filter, and date range functionalities. A consistent pattern is the use of parameterized queries for database interactions,  improving security and maintainability.  The `serial_id` field is repeatedly used as a primary key or identifier across different models and functions.  The changes to `vesselService.ts` include corrections and improvements to database query building, error handling, and data formatting.  Finally, around 5:15 PM and 5:17 PM, `Paths.ts` is updated to correct the base path for the vessel routes.


## 6:14:52 PM
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within a React application, focusing on vessel management features.  The most significant changes occurred between 5:21 PM and 6:10 PM on September 17, 2025.

**`vesselDataApi.ts`:** This file, a Redux toolkit API slice, underwent several revisions. Initially, the `fetchVesselDetails` endpoint used `/api/master/vessel-details`,  but was later changed to `/api/vessel/vessel-details`.  A more substantial change at 5:56 PM and 5:59 PM altered the `saveVessel` mutation's URL from `/api/master/create-vessel` to `/api/vessel/create-vessel`.  Finally at 5:59 PM and 6:00 PM the `getVesselCardVData` endpoint URL changed from `/api/master/vessel-card-details` to `/api/vessel/vessel-card-details`. This suggests a refactoring of the API endpoints, likely for better organization and consistency.

**`VesselDashboard.tsx`:** This component, responsible for displaying a vessel dashboard, was updated to improve the search functionality. Initially, the search was applied after filtering, but later around 6:09 PM, the search was integrated directly into the API query, making it more efficient by searching on the server-side rather than client-side. The search functionality changed from filtering the client-side data to sending the search term directly to the API call.

**`action.tsx`:** This file contains actions related to vessel management, and no significant changes were observed other than minor formatting differences between 5:40 PM and 5:41 PM.

**`VesselDetailsPage.tsx`:** This page handles the details and editing of vessel records. Several changes were made between 5:41 PM and 6:00 PM to improve error handling and the clarity of the code. Specifically, the `handleSubmit` function was enhanced with a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during vessel saving, providing more user-friendly feedback using `react-hot-toast`. The code was also reorganized for better readability.  The most significant change was the modification to correctly handle both adding and editing vessels in the API call, including the conditional sending of serial_id depending on the mode.


**`VesselDetailsForm.tsx`:** This component remained largely unchanged at 5:53 PM; it's primarily a form for vessel details.

**`data/options/common.ts`:** This file, containing various option sets for the application, was updated at 6:02 PM. The addition of new options or modification of existing ones in this file may reflect enhancements to existing components. No specific changes were analyzed beyond adding new arrays.

In summary, the major updates focused on refining API calls for better efficiency and organization, enhancing the user experience through improved error handling and feedback, and streamlining the search functionality in the Vessel Dashboard.  The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of iterative development and refinement.
