# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 11:14:47 AM
The primary file modified, `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\lineBookingSlice.ts`, on 9/17/2025 at 11:14:15 AM, is a Redux slice managing line bookings.  It defines reducers for various actions: `addList` (adds a new line booking, generating a unique serial ID if not in edit mode), `updateList` (updates an existing line booking), `removeList` (removes a line booking), `resetLineBooking` (resets the entire state), `clearBookings` (clears the line bookings array), `setLineBookings` (sets the line bookings and vessel voyage ID), `setVesselVoyageId` (sets the vessel voyage ID), and `initializeNewBookingSession` (initializes a new booking session).  The code uses a unique identifier, often `serial_id`, to manage and update items in the `line_bookings` array.  A significant portion of the code is focused on managing and updating the `serial_id` field for UI consistency across add, update, and delete operations.  The `idField` parameter provides flexibility in specifying the ID field if it's not `serial_id`.


## 12:14:29 PM
The `linebookingService.ts` file, updated on September 17, 2025, at 11:40:59 AM,  defines services for managing line bookings.  Key functionalities include creating, retrieving, and updating line bookings, along with their associated equipment.

The `create` function inserts new line bookings into the `line_booking_master` and `line_booking_equipments` tables. It uses transactions (`BEGIN` and `COMMIT`) to ensure data consistency and checks for existing bookings with the same `line_booking_no`.

The `getAll` function retrieves all line bookings, applying pagination and filtering based on various parameters (page number, status, dates, location codes, line name, and order).  It dynamically constructs SQL queries using a `QueryBuilder` class, efficiently fetching data and including related equipment details.  The query is logged using a logger.

The `getByVesselVoyageId` function retrieves line bookings associated with a specific vessel voyage ID, including equipment information.

The `update` function handles both updates and insertions of line bookings. If a `serial_id` is provided in the request body, it updates the existing record in `line_booking_master` and replaces the associated equipment in `line_booking_equipments`. Otherwise, it creates a new line booking. Transaction management ensures data integrity during updates.  A commented-out section suggests previous logic for mandatory `serial_id` in update requests, which was possibly removed or altered in this commit.

Throughout the code,  `query` and `insertQuery` functions are used extensively for database interactions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.  The code uses `moment.js` for date manipulation. A common pattern is the retrieval of line booking equipment details via separate queries after fetching main booking details.


## 12:14:53 PM
The log shows numerous updates to the `lineBookingSlice.ts` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` files between 11:16 AM and 12:12 PM on September 17, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on managing line booking data within a Redux store and its corresponding form.

**`lineBookingSlice.ts` Changes:**

The `lineBookingSlice.ts` file underwent several iterations, all revolving around the `addList` reducer.  Initial versions assigned temporary `serial_id`s based on array index,  handling edit mode inconsistently. Later versions improved this by:

*   **11:37 AM:**  Refined `serial_id` assignment logic.  The reducer now preserves existing `serial_id`s from the database while assigning temporary IDs only for new entries in add mode.
*   **11:46 AM:** Introduced a `temp_id` field to differentiate temporary client-side IDs from actual database `serial_id`s.
*   **12:01 AM - 12:12 PM:** The `temp_id` assignment logic was simplified and improved for better clarity and accuracy. The final version removes the need for `isEditMode` in the `addList` reducer, making it more concise.  A minor syntax error (`|| ,`) was also corrected in the final update.  The ultimate simplification resulted in assigning `serial_id` directly to the next available number based on current length.



**`LineBookingForm.tsx` Changes:**

The `LineBookingForm.tsx` file's updates are closely tied to the `lineBookingSlice` changes.  The initial versions had a `cleanedBookings` function to remove or modify `serial_id` before API calls.  This was to ensure temporary IDs didn't interfere with database operations.

*   **11:17 AM - 11:18 AM:**  Added `console.log` statements for debugging purposes. These were likely added to track the data flow within the component, particularly focusing on how the `initialValues` and `booking` properties were handled during edit mode.
*   **11:23 AM - 11:38 AM:** The `cleanedBookings` function was initially commented out, then modified to handle removing the `serial_id` from new rows only.
*   **11:47 AM - 11:49 AM:** Further refined `cleanedBookings`. The function now also removes the temporary `temp_id` field before sending data to the API.
*   **11:58 AM - 12:02 PM - 12:06 PM:** The  `cleanedBookings` function was replaced by  `getChangedOrNewBookings` function. This function efficiently identifies only the new or modified bookings to be sent during an update operation, improving efficiency. This change ensures only necessary data is sent to the backend, optimizing update requests and preventing unnecessary overwrites.  The final version removed unnecessary console logs to clean up the code.

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a continuous effort towards more efficient and robust handling of line booking data, particularly concerning the management of temporary and persistent IDs during both adding and updating entries.  The debugging statements and function refinements highlight an iterative development approach focused on improving data integrity and performance.
