# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 10:38:15 AM
The provided log shows two entries for the same file, `customerBookingService.ts`,  both at 9/12/2025 but with a slight time difference (8:06:06 PM and 8:11:29 PM).  The code within the file is identical in both entries, suggesting that the second entry might be a redundant or accidental duplicate rather than a meaningful code change.

The `customerBookingService.ts` file contains functions for managing customer bookings.  These functions interact with a database (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`), handle request and response objects (`IReq`, `IRes`), generate booking IDs, and perform various operations related to bookings including:

* **Retrieving new booking IDs:** `getNewBookingId`
* **Getting all bookings:** `getAll` (includes pagination and filtering) fetching related equipment data.
* **Creating/assigning a new customer booking:** `newCustomerBooking`  This function performs validation and updates the database.
* **Updating customer booking containers:** `updateCustomerBooking`.  This function handles database transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), deletes old container data, inserts new data, and manages file uploads associated with containers.
* **Getting customer booking details by ID:** `getCustomerBookingById` This function retrieves booking container details and associated image URLs.

The code extensively uses SQL queries to interact with a database with tables including `line_booking_master`, `line_booking_equipments`, `customer_booking_containers`, and `document_upload`.  Error handling is implemented consistently across all functions, usually returning a 500 status code with an error message.  The functions also utilize logging (`logger`) for debugging and monitoring purposes.


## 10:38:22 AM
The log shows multiple updates across several files related to a customer booking system frontend.  Significant changes occurred between 8:02 PM and 8:53 PM on September 12th, 2025.

**`NewCustomerBookingPage.tsx`:** This component underwent several iterations.  Initially, it used `FormData` for API calls to `saveNewCustomerBooking`. This was changed to send a JSON payload instead, improving data handling.  The final version also added pagination to the `AppGrid` component.  Several console.log statements were present throughout the development process.  Changes to this file focused primarily on improving the submission of data to the backend API and adding pagination to enhance the user experience.


**`customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`:**  This file defines columns for data grids related to customer and customer booking dashboards.  Notable updates include:

*   Changes to how status badges are displayed (color updates and status mapping).
*   Addition of a shipping icon (`MdLocalShipping`) to the "Other Service" column in `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`.
*   Addition of a checkmark icon (`MdFactCheck`) to represent other services (`custom_clearance` and `transportation`)  in  `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`.
*   The most significant change involved refining the status display within the `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` to utilize a color mapping system from the `LINE_BOOKING_STATUS` object within the `common.ts` file. This improves consistency and clarity.



**`customerBookingApi.ts`:** This file contains API slices for interacting with the customer booking backend. A major revision involved changing the `saveNewCustomerBooking` mutation's body parameter type from `FormData` to `FormData`. This likely reflects a change in how the backend handles data submissions.  The `cancelLineBooking` mutation was removed in a later update.


**`common.ts`:** This file houses various option lists, including `LINE_BOOKING_STATUS`, which was updated to improve the visual representation of booking statuses in the data grid by mapping status to colours.


**`actions.tsx`:** This file contains helper functions for generating action items in data grids. The `getCustomerBookingActions` function was simplified by removing unnecessary elements, and the `TrashIcon` was removed.


**`CustomerBookingDashboard.tsx`:** This component displays customer booking data.  The most notable changes were related to the UI. The filter and sort functionality was initially present but later commented out. This suggests a possible change in design or functionality, possibly moving these features elsewhere within the application.



**`App.tsx`:** This file defines the application routing. It shows the addition of routes for `UpdateCustomerBooking` component and related navigation paths.

In summary, the log indicates a focused development effort on improving data handling in the API calls, refining the visual presentation of data, and enhancing user interaction. The removal of some UI elements and refactoring of certain components might indicate a shift in design or prioritization during the development process.


## 1:42:39 PM
The log shows modifications to the `envosys-backend` project between 11:47 AM and 12:13 PM on September 15, 2025.  The most significant changes are related to configuration and the `linebookingService`.

**`config/config.ts`**: This file underwent multiple revisions focusing on how environment variables are loaded using the `dotenv` package. Initially, the path to the `.env` files was adjusted.  Logging statements were added and then removed in subsequent commits, to debug the loading process. Finally, the path resolution was changed from `path.join` to `path.resolve`, likely to ensure consistent loading across different environments.

**`package.json`**:  The `dev` script was modified by removing the `dotenv` command.  This suggests a shift in how environment variables are managed, likely relying entirely on the system's environment variables or a different method.

**`src/services/linebookingService.ts`**: This file contains the code for managing line bookings.  There were several commits with no apparent code changes to the file itself, suggesting that the focus might have been on testing or debugging the service.  The code shows robust error handling with transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`), indicating a concern for data integrity. The service handles creation, retrieval (including pagination), updating, and confirmation of line bookings.  The `confirmLineBooking` function includes file uploads using the `saveDoc` function, implying a document management feature.


## 1:43:13 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the frontend code of an application, primarily focused on a line booking feature.  The changes span several components and Redux slices, demonstrating iterative development.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component displays an overview of line booking data.  Significant changes include:

* **9/15/2025, 11:58:20 AM:** Initial version, fetching line booking count data using a lazy query and displaying it in cards. A modal for `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup` is implemented.
* **9/15/2025, 12:08:52 PM:** The `useLazyGetLineBookingCardDataQuery` is replaced with `useGetLineBookingCardDataQuery`. The query parameters are now conditionally set based on the date filter.
* **9/15/2025, 12:18:24 PM:**  The fetched data is processed to access the `data` property (`countsObj = lineBookingCountData?.data || {};`).
* **9/15/2025, 12:21:12 PM:** Added `console.log("---countsObj---",countsObj);` for debugging purposes.
* **9/15/2025, 12:28:33 PM:** The card display is changed to show specific booking counts ("Confirmed Bookings", "Cancelled Bookings", etc.) from `countsObj`, rather than static data from `lineBookingData`.
* **9/15/2025, 12:29:50 PM:** Minor formatting and structural changes to the code.  The order of counts in the `counts` array is adjusted.
* **9/15/2025, 12:33:05 PM & 12:33:10 PM:**  Further minor adjustments, primarily code cleanup and styling. The `useEffect` hook is removed.


**`lineBookingApi.ts`:** This file defines the API slices for interacting with the line booking backend.  It includes mutations for saving, updating, confirming, and canceling line bookings, as well as queries for fetching dashboard data and details.  The API endpoints suggest a RESTful architecture.  The timestamp of the single revision (9/15/2025, 11:59:45 AM) indicates a complete definition of the API calls at this stage.


**`line-booking.types.ts`:**  This file defines TypeScript interfaces for various line booking related data structures, including `LineBookingData`, `FilterState`, `Column`, `LineBooking`, `LineBookingEqup`, `BookingPayload`, `LineBookingDashboardDates`, and `LineBookingState`. The creation timestamp (9/15/2025, 12:20:12 PM) shows a comprehensive type definition for the line booking feature.


**`lineBookingDashboardSlice.ts`:** A Redux slice managing the state for the line booking dashboard.  It includes reducers for pagination, filters, and sorting. The timestamp (9/15/2025, 12:20:44 PM) signifies the creation of the Redux slice and its actions.


**`config/data.ts`:** This file contains sample data for various dashboard components, including line booking overviews.  The timestamp of the single revision (9/15/2025, 12:27:36 PM) suggests this is the data source used for initial UI. The data is structured as an array of `OverviewItem` objects, each with a title, value, changes, background color, icon color, and icon component.


**`optionService.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This service handles fetching and normalizing options for dropdown selections or autocomplete components.  The multiple revisions show a focus on refining the normalization of "vessel-voyage" options, ultimately concatenating `vessel_name` and `voyage` with a tilde (~) separator in the value and label fields. The revisions all fall between 12:38 PM and 12:45 PM.


**`vesselVoyagePopup.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component is a popup for selecting vessel voyage details.  Initial versions lacked validation and error handling. Revisions included adding validation, error handling, and the `enableReinitialize`, `validateOnChange`, and `validateOnBlur` properties to `useFormik`. The changes were made between 12:47 PM and 1:05 PM.

In summary, the log demonstrates a focused effort to build and refine a line booking feature in a React application using Redux and Formik for state management and form handling.  The changes showcase iterative improvement, adding features like validation, error handling, and enhanced UI elements over time.  The `optionService` demonstrates careful attention to data normalization for consistent handling of API responses.


## 3:52:52 PM
The `linebookingService.ts` file underwent modifications on September 15, 2025.  The first update at 3:28:47 PM focused primarily on creating and retrieving line bookings.  The code included functions for creating (`create`), retrieving all (`getAll`), retrieving by vessel voyage ID (`getByVesselVoyageId`), updating (`update`), confirming (`confirmLineBooking`), and changing the status (`changeStatus`) of line bookings.  These functions extensively use SQL queries to interact with a database, managing transactions with `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` (and `ROLLBACK` for error handling).  Data is fetched and presented with pagination and error handling throughout.

The second update at 3:52:05 PM significantly enhanced the `getAll` function.  The most notable change is the addition of new filtering and sorting capabilities.  The `getAll` function now accepts parameters for `fromDate`, `toDate`, `pol`, `pod`, `line_name`, and `orderBy`, allowing for more refined queries based on date ranges, port of loading (POL), port of discharge (POD), line name, and custom sorting.  The `moment` library was added to handle date formatting for these filters. The query itself was updated to include additional fields and the ability to join with the `voyage` table to retrieve `vessel_name` and `voyage` information.  The `QueryBuilder` is used for query construction and now incorporates sorting capabilities.


## 3:53:03 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the frontend code of an Envosys application focused on line booking management.  Several files were updated between 1:59 PM and 3:49 PM on September 15, 2025.

`lineBookingDashboardSlice.ts`: This file, updated at 1:59 PM, is a Redux slice managing the state of a line booking dashboard.  It includes reducers for pagination, filtering (by date, status, name, etc.), sorting, and date range selection.

`vessel.types.ts`: Updated at 2:00 PM, this file defines TypeScript interfaces for vessel details, filters, pagination, table columns, and filter configurations.  It establishes data structures used throughout the application for handling vessel-related information.

`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`: This component, underwent multiple revisions (2:56 PM, 2:59 PM (twice), 3:03 PM, 3:08 PM, 3:11 PM, and 3:27 PM).  The main changes revolve around the form's functionality, particularly its handling of edit mode and the `enableReinitialize` option in `useFormik`. The initial values are now consistently defined outside of the useFormik call for better readability.  The code also refactors how edit mode is detected and improves how the form handles form submission and redirects the user after submission. The `count` field in `equipments` was also adjusted to handle numbers correctly.

`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This component also experienced multiple updates (3:02 PM, 3:05 PM, 3:14 PM, 3:21 PM, 3:23 PM, 3:25 PM, 3:31 PM (twice), and 3:49 PM). The major changes include enhancing the handling of add/edit modes, including a dedicated state management for new booking sessions using `initializeNewBookingSession` in the `lineBookingSlice`.  The  `resetLineBooking` action is used more consistently to clear the Redux store on various actions.  The use of API mutations (`useSaveLineBookingMutation`, `useUpdateLineBookingMutation`) for saving and updating line bookings was introduced. The code also includes more robust error handling and user feedback using `react-hot-toast`. Finally, there are UI improvements and the addition of a cancel button.


`line-booking.types.ts`: This file, modified at 3:08 PM and 3:10 PM, defines interfaces related to line booking data, including `LineBooking`, `LineBookingEqup`, and `BookingPayload`.  A key change is the alteration of the `count` field within `LineBookingEqup` from `number` to `number | string` for improved flexibility.


`data\coulms\line-booking-columns.tsx`: Updated at 3:34 PM, this file defines the columns for the line booking tables and dashboard. This update includes the introduction of  `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_STATUS` which aids in improving the status display.


A recurring pattern is the extensive use of Redux for state management and Formik for handling forms.  The updates consistently focus on improving user experience (UX) through clearer error handling and feedback, more streamlined data flow, and enhanced UI elements.  There's a clear progression of changes in `AddLineBookingForm.tsx` and `LineBookingForm.tsx` improving error handling, initial value setting, and state management with Redux. The changes to `lineBookingSlice.ts` directly support these improvements.


## 5:52:51 PM
The codebase reflects a backend service for providing search options.  Significant changes occurred on September 15th, 2025, between 5:33 PM and 5:34 PM.

`searchOptions.ts` (5:33:36 PM): This file implements an API endpoint (`getAll`) that retrieves search options based on a provided `endpointKey` and `keyword`.  The endpoint handles various search types:  sales data (import/export, air/sea), customer names, ports, users, and vessel voyages.  It uses a `fieldMap` to consolidate common field names for sales data searches.  Error handling is included for missing parameters and invalid endpoint keys. The implementation uses a helper class `OptionQuery` to build the database queries.  The response is a JSON array of objects with `value` and `label` properties.

`optionQuery.ts` (5:34:34 PM): This file contains utility functions for constructing database queries. The `OptionQuery` class defines methods for generating SQL queries based on different search criteria (ports, GST locations, users, vessel voyages, customer names).  All queries utilize parameterized SQL for better security against SQL injection.  The `buildOptionQuery` and `buildQueryOptions` functions provide generic query building capabilities with pagination and sorting support but are not used in the `searchOptions.ts` file, suggesting potential future use or extensibility.  Queries consistently apply lowercasing to keywords for case-insensitive searches and limit results to 10.


In summary, the changes introduce a new search API endpoint with robust error handling and different search types supported. The supporting utility file provides reusable SQL query generation functions for improved maintainability and extensibility.  A recurring pattern is the use of `ILIKE` for case-insensitive searches and consistent 10-record result limits.


## 5:53:06 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the frontend code of an application managing line bookings.  Changes span several files across multiple timestamps between 3:54 PM and 5:52 PM on September 15th, 2025.

`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx`:  This component initially fetched line booking details and displayed them in a form. A key update (around 3:55 PM) added the `vessel_name` field to the displayed data.  Later (around 4:26 PM), the `voyage` field was also added to the fetched and displayed data.

`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This form component underwent significant revisions.  Initially (3:57 PM), it handled saving and updating line bookings. Subsequent changes (around 4:04 PM - 5:06 PM) focused on improving the display of vessel name and voyage information, using data from either the initial values or from the Redux store. The method of accessing `vessel_name` was refined to correctly pull from the `line_bookings` array. The logic for obtaining the `vesselName` and `voyage` variables was improved to prioritize values from `firstBooking` and then fall back to `vesselData`.  Finally, the way `fromLineBookingPage` was passed in the navigation state was made more consistent.

`line-booking.types.ts`: The type definitions for line booking data were updated several times, primarily (3:58 PM, 3:59 PM, 4:05 PM, 4:06 PM, and 5:40 PM) to consistently include the `vessel_name` and later the `voyage` field in the `LineBooking` interface, reflecting the changes in data handling in other components.  A new `FilterType` interface was added (5:40 PM).

`action.tsx`: This file, containing functions for line booking actions (around 4:22 PM and 5:11 PM), initially passed `vessel_voyage_id` and `vessel_name` for editing.  A later update (5:11 PM) changed the edit navigation to pass only the `serial_id`, streamlining the process and making it more consistent with the ID-based system in the Redux store.


`AddLineBookingForm.tsx`: This form for adding/editing line bookings was created (4:33 PM) and underwent minor revisions. The main change between the initial version and the final version (4:38 PM and 4:52 PM) is the improvement of the page title to show "Edit" when appropriate. Navigation in this component was also adjusted (4:52 PM) to remove the passing of vessel data to the next page, resulting in a leaner state management.


`lineBookingSlice.ts`: The Redux slice managing line booking state was modified (4:47 PM and 5:31 PM).  The `setVesselData` action was added and the `vesselData` field was removed from the `LineBookingState` interface.  This indicates a change in how vessel data is managed within the application state.

`optionService.ts`: This file (5:28 PM), responsible for fetching and normalizing options for UI components like the auto-complete search, was added. It defines a `normalizeOption` function to handle different option types.

`LineBookingDashboard.tsx`: This component displays a dashboard for line bookings (5:42 PM - 5:52 PM). The primary change made to this component involved changing the way filters and sorting are handled to use the Redux store for management.  Also, the `filterConfig` was changed to remove unnecessary filter options.


Overall, the code changes reflect a progression towards better data consistency and more efficient state management, particularly through the use of Redux. The focus was on improving the handling and display of vessel and voyage data, and refining the overall user experience.
