# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 10:38:15 AM
The provided log shows two entries for the same file, `customerBookingService.ts`,  both at 9/12/2025 but with a slight time difference (8:06:06 PM and 8:11:29 PM).  The code within the file is identical in both entries, suggesting that the second entry might be a redundant or accidental duplicate rather than a meaningful code change.

The `customerBookingService.ts` file contains functions for managing customer bookings.  These functions interact with a database (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`), handle request and response objects (`IReq`, `IRes`), generate booking IDs, and perform various operations related to bookings including:

* **Retrieving new booking IDs:** `getNewBookingId`
* **Getting all bookings:** `getAll` (includes pagination and filtering) fetching related equipment data.
* **Creating/assigning a new customer booking:** `newCustomerBooking`  This function performs validation and updates the database.
* **Updating customer booking containers:** `updateCustomerBooking`.  This function handles database transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), deletes old container data, inserts new data, and manages file uploads associated with containers.
* **Getting customer booking details by ID:** `getCustomerBookingById` This function retrieves booking container details and associated image URLs.

The code extensively uses SQL queries to interact with a database with tables including `line_booking_master`, `line_booking_equipments`, `customer_booking_containers`, and `document_upload`.  Error handling is implemented consistently across all functions, usually returning a 500 status code with an error message.  The functions also utilize logging (`logger`) for debugging and monitoring purposes.


## 10:38:22 AM
The log shows multiple updates across several files related to a customer booking system frontend.  Significant changes occurred between 8:02 PM and 8:53 PM on September 12th, 2025.

**`NewCustomerBookingPage.tsx`:** This component underwent several iterations.  Initially, it used `FormData` for API calls to `saveNewCustomerBooking`. This was changed to send a JSON payload instead, improving data handling.  The final version also added pagination to the `AppGrid` component.  Several console.log statements were present throughout the development process.  Changes to this file focused primarily on improving the submission of data to the backend API and adding pagination to enhance the user experience.


**`customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`:**  This file defines columns for data grids related to customer and customer booking dashboards.  Notable updates include:

*   Changes to how status badges are displayed (color updates and status mapping).
*   Addition of a shipping icon (`MdLocalShipping`) to the "Other Service" column in `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`.
*   Addition of a checkmark icon (`MdFactCheck`) to represent other services (`custom_clearance` and `transportation`)  in  `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`.
*   The most significant change involved refining the status display within the `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` to utilize a color mapping system from the `LINE_BOOKING_STATUS` object within the `common.ts` file. This improves consistency and clarity.



**`customerBookingApi.ts`:** This file contains API slices for interacting with the customer booking backend. A major revision involved changing the `saveNewCustomerBooking` mutation's body parameter type from `FormData` to `FormData`. This likely reflects a change in how the backend handles data submissions.  The `cancelLineBooking` mutation was removed in a later update.


**`common.ts`:** This file houses various option lists, including `LINE_BOOKING_STATUS`, which was updated to improve the visual representation of booking statuses in the data grid by mapping status to colours.


**`actions.tsx`:** This file contains helper functions for generating action items in data grids. The `getCustomerBookingActions` function was simplified by removing unnecessary elements, and the `TrashIcon` was removed.


**`CustomerBookingDashboard.tsx`:** This component displays customer booking data.  The most notable changes were related to the UI. The filter and sort functionality was initially present but later commented out. This suggests a possible change in design or functionality, possibly moving these features elsewhere within the application.



**`App.tsx`:** This file defines the application routing. It shows the addition of routes for `UpdateCustomerBooking` component and related navigation paths.

In summary, the log indicates a focused development effort on improving data handling in the API calls, refining the visual presentation of data, and enhancing user interaction. The removal of some UI elements and refactoring of certain components might indicate a shift in design or prioritization during the development process.


## 1:42:39 PM
The log shows modifications to the `envosys-backend` project between 11:47 AM and 12:13 PM on September 15, 2025.  The most significant changes are related to configuration and the `linebookingService`.

**`config/config.ts`**: This file underwent multiple revisions focusing on how environment variables are loaded using the `dotenv` package. Initially, the path to the `.env` files was adjusted.  Logging statements were added and then removed in subsequent commits, to debug the loading process. Finally, the path resolution was changed from `path.join` to `path.resolve`, likely to ensure consistent loading across different environments.

**`package.json`**:  The `dev` script was modified by removing the `dotenv` command.  This suggests a shift in how environment variables are managed, likely relying entirely on the system's environment variables or a different method.

**`src/services/linebookingService.ts`**: This file contains the code for managing line bookings.  There were several commits with no apparent code changes to the file itself, suggesting that the focus might have been on testing or debugging the service.  The code shows robust error handling with transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`), indicating a concern for data integrity. The service handles creation, retrieval (including pagination), updating, and confirmation of line bookings.  The `confirmLineBooking` function includes file uploads using the `saveDoc` function, implying a document management feature.


## 1:43:13 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the frontend code of an application, primarily focused on a line booking feature.  The changes span several components and Redux slices, demonstrating iterative development.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component displays an overview of line booking data.  Significant changes include:

* **9/15/2025, 11:58:20 AM:** Initial version, fetching line booking count data using a lazy query and displaying it in cards. A modal for `VesselVoyageDetailsPopup` is implemented.
* **9/15/2025, 12:08:52 PM:** The `useLazyGetLineBookingCardDataQuery` is replaced with `useGetLineBookingCardDataQuery`. The query parameters are now conditionally set based on the date filter.
* **9/15/2025, 12:18:24 PM:**  The fetched data is processed to access the `data` property (`countsObj = lineBookingCountData?.data || {};`).
* **9/15/2025, 12:21:12 PM:** Added `console.log("---countsObj---",countsObj);` for debugging purposes.
* **9/15/2025, 12:28:33 PM:** The card display is changed to show specific booking counts ("Confirmed Bookings", "Cancelled Bookings", etc.) from `countsObj`, rather than static data from `lineBookingData`.
* **9/15/2025, 12:29:50 PM:** Minor formatting and structural changes to the code.  The order of counts in the `counts` array is adjusted.
* **9/15/2025, 12:33:05 PM & 12:33:10 PM:**  Further minor adjustments, primarily code cleanup and styling. The `useEffect` hook is removed.
