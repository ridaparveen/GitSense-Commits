# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\enquiryService.ts`**
**Timestamp:** 10/21/2025, 11:02:05 AM

This file, responsible for enquiry-related services, received significant updates:

1.  **`getAll` function enhancements:**
    *   The function for retrieving all enquiries was updated to support advanced features including pagination (`page`, `perPage`), dynamic sorting (`orderBy` with `created_at` as default), and filtering by `enq_no`.
    *   It leverages a `QueryBuilder` for constructing dynamic SQL queries.
    *   A key performance improvement was implemented: nominated agents are now fetched once in a single query and then mapped by their `serial_id` to efficiently enrich each enquiry record with an `agent_details` array.
    *   Standardized error handling with logging and `HttpStatusCodes` is present.

2.  **New `getEnquiryCardInfo` function:**
    *   A new endpoint was introduced to fetch summary card information.
    *   This function specifically queries `vendor` data (aliased as `vs`) to count active, inactive, and total vendors.
    *   It supports flexible date-based filtering: by a specific `fromDate` and `toDate`, or by predefined `weekly` or `monthly` intervals.
    *   *Note:* While named `getEnquiryCardInfo`, its current implementation focuses on `vendor` statistics.
    *   Includes basic error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   Consistent use of utility functions for database interactions (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`) from `../common/util/database`.
*   Reliance on a `QueryBuilder` for constructing complex and dynamic SQL queries, promoting modularity and readability.
*   Structured error handling with `try...catch` blocks, logging (using `logger` and `console.error`), and returning appropriate `HttpStatusCodes` (e.g., `OK`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`).
*   Data enrichment patterns, specifically pre-fetching related data (like nominated agents) and then mapping it to the primary data set to reduce redundant queries.
*   Clear parameter handling for pagination, sorting, and filtering.

The provided log details recent development on the `envosys-frontend` application, primarily focusing on the integration and display of enquiry data.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\enquiryDataApi.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:06:39 PM)**: An API slice `enquiryDataApi` was initialized using Redux Toolkit Query. It defined endpoints for fetching dashboard data (initially pointed to `/api/vendor/getall`), saving/updating vendor data, fetching vendor details (incorrectly pointing to `/api/vessel/vessel-details`), and fetching vendor card data. The `tagTypes` were set up for `add`, `update`, `vendorDashboardData`, and `Details`.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:07:07 PM)**: The `fetchEnquiryDashboardData` endpoint's URL was corrected from `/api/vendor/getall` to `/api/enquiry/getall`, aligning its function with the `enquiryDataApi`'s name.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\store.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:08:12 PM)**: The `enquiryDataApi` reducer and middleware were integrated into the Redux store, making its API functionalities accessible throughout the application.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\enquiry\EnquiryDashboard.tsx`**:
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:09:40 PM)**: The `EnquiryPanel` component was created, utilizing `useFetchEnquiryDashboardDataQuery`. Initially, it rendered a `CollapsibleTable` with local dummy data (`enqueryData`). It included features like search, filter sidebar, Excel export, and a modal for agent information. Column definitions for "Enquiry" (as `Enquiry`) and "Remark" were set up.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:11:50 PM)**: The `CollapsibleTable` was updated to display live data from the API (`enquriDashboardData`) instead of the local dummy data.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:12:17 PM)**: The column field for "Enquiry No." and its corresponding search logic were changed from `"Enquiry"` to `"enquiry_no"`.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:19:50 PM)**: The "action" column (containing a "Place Booking" button) was commented out from the `detailColumns` array, removing it from the nested rows.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:24:32 PM)**: A significant rollback occurred, reverting the `CollapsibleTable` data source to use local state/search filtered data, changing the "Enquiry No." column field back to `"Enquiry"`, adjusting search logic accordingly, and re-enabling the "Place Booking" action button in `detailColumns`.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:25:04 PM)**: The `CollapsibleTable` data source was again updated to use API data, specifically `enquriDashboardData?.data || []`, to correctly access the data array from the API response.
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:27:22 PM)**: The column field for "Remarks" was changed from `"Remark"` to `"remarks"`. A potential bug was introduced as the `onChange` handler for this column still referenced the old `"Remark"` field.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\enquiry.types.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:21:19 PM)**: The `EnquiryData` interface was updated to use `enquiry_no` instead of `Enquiry`, aligning with API changes. A comprehensive `EnquiryFormValues` interface was also defined, indicating future form development for enquiry creation or modification.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\common\CollapsibleTable.tsx`**:
    *   **Timestamp (10/21/2025, 5:23:42 PM)**: Minor styling adjustments were made to icon buttons and box margins. The expansion/collapse icons were updated. A custom pagination component (`CustomNewPagination`) was implemented, replacing the standard Material UI `TablePagination`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/21/2025, 5:07:07 PM**: `enquiryDataApi.ts` endpoint correction to fetch actual enquiry data.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:08:12 PM**: `enquiryDataApi` successfully integrated into the Redux store.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:11:50 PM**: `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` started fetching and displaying live API data.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:12:17 PM**: Column field name `Enquiry` changed to `enquiry_no` in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx`.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:21:19 PM**: Type definition for `EnquiryData` updated (`enquiry_no`) and `EnquiryFormValues` introduced.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:24:32 PM**: A notable temporary rollback of `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` changes, indicating active debugging or feature adjustments.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:25:04 PM**: Final adjustment to `CollapsibleTable` data source in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` to handle API response structure.
*   **10/21/2025, 5:27:22 PM**: Column field `Remark` changed to `remarks` in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx`, with an associated inconsistency in the update handler.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development of `EnquiryDashboard.tsx`**: The `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` component saw multiple rapid changes, indicating active development, testing, and refinement of its features, especially concerning data display, column definitions, and UI interactions (search, filter, export).
*   **API Integration**: There's a clear pattern of transitioning from static, dummy data to dynamic data fetched from a backend API using Redux Toolkit Query.
*   **Refinement of Data Structure and Naming**: Changes like `Enquiry` to `enquiry_no` in both component columns and type definitions, and `Remark` to `remarks`, suggest a move towards standardized data keys.
*   **Rollbacks and Re-implementations**: The temporary rollback in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` (5:24:32 PM) followed by re-implementations highlights a trial-and-error process or immediate corrections during development.
*   **Consistent UI Component Usage**: The `CollapsibleTable` component is central to displaying tabular data across these changes, suggesting it's a reusable and integral part of the application's UI.
*   **Potential Naming Inconsistency**: Despite the `enquiryDataApi`'s name, it still retains endpoints related to `vendor` and `vessel` data throughout the log, hinting at a broader or initially misnamed API context.
