This file, responsible for enquiry-related services, received significant updates:

1.  **`getAll` function enhancements:**
    *   The function for retrieving all enquiries was updated to support advanced features including pagination (`page`, `perPage`), dynamic sorting (`orderBy` with `created_at` as default), and filtering by `enq_no`.
    *   It leverages a `QueryBuilder` for constructing dynamic SQL queries.
    *   A key performance improvement was implemented: nominated agents are now fetched once in a single query and then mapped by their `serial_id` to efficiently enrich each enquiry record with an `agent_details` array.
    *   Standardized error handling with logging and `HttpStatusCodes` is present.

2.  **New `getEnquiryCardInfo` function:**
    *   A new endpoint was introduced to fetch summary card information.
    *   This function specifically queries `vendor` data (aliased as `vs`) to count active, inactive, and total vendors.
    *   It supports flexible date-based filtering: by a specific `fromDate` and `toDate`, or by predefined `weekly` or `monthly` intervals.
    *   *Note:* While named `getEnquiryCardInfo`, its current implementation focuses on `vendor` statistics.
    *   Includes basic error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   Consistent use of utility functions for database interactions (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`) from `../common/util/database`.
*   Reliance on a `QueryBuilder` for constructing complex and dynamic SQL queries, promoting modularity and readability.
*   Structured error handling with `try...catch` blocks, logging (using `logger` and `console.error`), and returning appropriate `HttpStatusCodes` (e.g., `OK`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`).
*   Data enrichment patterns, specifically pre-fetching related data (like nominated agents) and then mapping it to the primary data set to reduce redundant queries.
*   Clear parameter handling for pagination, sorting, and filtering.
