# Activity Summary for 10/23/2025

## 10:31:45 AM
The provided log details changes to the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` file, with the last recorded update on **October 22, 2025, at 11:01:53 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates (`analytics.route.ts`):**

This file is responsible for defining the API routes for the analytics module within the `t360-backend` application. The changes indicate a comprehensive setup for analytics functionalities, including:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are exposed for dashboards via `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests to `/dashboards`. These operations are handled by the `core.view.controller`.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Listing:** Routes are provided to fetch lists of dashboard endpoints (`/dashboardEndPoints`) and available metrics (`/metricsList`), using `GET` requests and handled by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **Data Export:** An endpoint `/excelExport` is available for exporting data via a `GET` request, managed by `core.export.controller`.
*   **User Preferences:** Functionality to save user preferences, specifically `saveSequence` and `saveSize`, is exposed through `POST` requests to `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` respectively, also managed by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **Reporting:** A variety of specific data reports are exposed via `GET` requests, each handled by its dedicated controller:
    *   `/cbm` for CBM reports (`cbm.controller`)
    *   `/kgs` for KGS reports (`kgs.controller`)
    *   `/teu` for TEU reports (`teu.controller`)
    *   `/containers` for Container reports (`container.controller`)
    *   `/transit` for Transit reports (`transit.controller`)
    *   `/Tables/tableData` for general table data reports (`others.controller`)

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

A clear pattern observed is the modular organization of analytics functionalities. Different aspects of analytics (view management, metric management, CBM, KGS, TEU, container, transit reports, and export) are separated into distinct controller files. This `analytics.route.ts` file then acts as an aggregator, importing functions from these controllers and mapping them to specific API endpoints. The majority of the routes are `GET` requests for retrieving data and reports, while `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are used for managing dashboard resources and saving user preferences.

## 10:32:27 AM
A series of rapid updates occurred on October 22, 2025, primarily focused on developing and refining an "Analytics" feature within the T360-V2 backend.

**Key Information by File:**

*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/22/2025, 12:19:46 PM):** The core routing constants were significantly expanded to introduce a new `Analytics` module. This module defines numerous endpoints for dashboard management, metric retrieval, data export, and layout configuration, including `/dashboards`, `/create`, `/update`, `/delete-view`, `/dashboardEndPoints`, `/metricsList`, `/excelExport`, `/save-sequence`, `/save_size`, and various data-specific endpoints like `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and `/Tables/tableData`.

*   **`src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 12:20:38 PM to 4:38:37 PM):**
    *   Initially (12:20:38 PM), the `AnalyticsRoutes` were created, but mistakenly mapped dashboard service functions (`getDashboardCardInfo`, `getDeliveryData`) to `Paths.Dashboard` endpoints.
    *   By 12:33:26 PM, these incorrect mappings were removed, and the routes began correctly referencing `getAll` from `coreViewService` for `Paths.Analytics.Get`.
    *   Further updates (12:34:42 PM) integrated the full CRUD functionality for dashboard views by mapping `create`, `update`, and `deleteView` from `coreViewService` to their respective `Paths.Analytics` endpoints.
    *   Later, `dashboardEndPointList` and `getMetricList` from the newly introduced `coreMetricService` were mapped to `Paths.Analytics.DashboardEndPoints` and `Paths.Analytics.MetricsList` respectively (4:13:43 PM, 4:22:31 PM).
    *   Finally (4:38:37 PM), `saveSequence` and `saveSize` from `coreMetricService` were correctly mapped to `Paths.Analytics.SaveSequence` and `Paths.Analytics.SaveSize` (both as POST requests), and `getExportData` from `analyticsExportService` was mapped to `Paths.Analytics.GetExcelReport` (4:40:33 PM).

*   **`src\routes\index.ts` (10/22/2025, 12:21:23 PM):** The main API router was updated to include the new `AnalyticsRoutes` under the `Paths.Analytics.Base` path, marking the integration of the analytics feature into the application's routing.

*   **`src\services\coreViewService.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 12:26:53 PM to 12:46:12 PM):** This new service was created to manage user-defined dashboard views.
    *   It defines `getAll`, `create`, `update`, and `deleteView` functions, which interact with a `dashboards` table to store and retrieve view configurations (menu titles and associated metrics). An `analytics_view_log` table is used for auditing these actions.
    *   Early changes improved type safety by switching request types to `IAuthReq` and `Response`.
    *   A significant change (12:46:12 PM) improved SQL query security for `CREATE` and `UPDATE` operations by implementing parameterized queries for `dashboard_metrics` and `user_id`, reducing SQL injection risks, though `DELETE` operations continued to use string interpolation for user-provided values.

*   **`src\models\common\types\analytics.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 12:27:34 PM to 4:36:01 PM):** This file saw a gradual evolution of interfaces to support the analytics feature's data structures:
    *   `CheckBoxDetails` was introduced (12:27:34 PM).
    *   `MenuRow` was added, initially with `menu_title`, then expanded to include `metricsId`, `dashboard_metrics`, and `size` (12:37:00 PM, 4:05:10 PM).
    *   `DashboardItem` was added to define dashboard report items, later gaining `dashboard_name` (4:11:25 PM, 4:19:45 PM).
    *   `MetricListDataI` and `MetricRow` were added to type metric list data and individual metric rows respectively (4:14:47 PM, 4:36:01 PM).

*   **`src\services\coreMetricService.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 4:11:45 PM to 4:38:20 PM):** This new service handles metric-specific operations:
    *   `dashboardEndPointList` (4:11:45 PM) retrieves metric endpoints and layout information (`rowSpan`, `columnSpan`) for a given dashboard view, sorting them by a stored sequence.
    *   `getMetricList` (4:17:27 PM) fetches all available metrics, categorizes them (Container_Wise, MBL_Wise), and supports preloading a dashboard's selected metrics. This function also contained string interpolation in SQL queries, which was partially addressed.
    *   `saveSequence` and `saveSize` (4:27:44 PM) were added to allow users to customize the order and size of metrics in their dashboards. These functions extensively use string interpolation for constructing SQL queries, which is a potential security concern. Type guards and nullish coalescing were introduced for safer handling of user data in `saveSequence` (4:32:09 PM).

*   **`src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 4:40:11 PM to 6:08:54 PM):** This new service provides functionality for exporting analytics data.
    *   `getExportData` (4:40:11 PM) dynamically constructs SQL queries based on various report parameters (date ranges, report name, booking status, columns, display type). It uses helper functions like `columnsQuery`, `saveColumns`, `dateFilterOnExport`, and `replaceColumnHandler` to prepare the data for export.
    *   Imports were updated to use `@src` aliases (4:47:46 PM).
    *   A notable change (6:08:54 PM) was the removal of the explicit import for `nonBookingQuery`, while the function is still referenced in the code, suggesting a possible oversight or implicit dependency.

*   **`src\utils\analytics.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 4:43:56 PM to 5:11:25 PM):** A new utility file containing helper functions for analytics:
    *   `defaultDateRange`: Provides a default date range (last 365 days).
    *   `replaceValueInQuery`: Utility to dynamically replace values in SQL queries (e.g., 'LONG BEACH' with 'LOS ANGELES').
    *   `getUserObject`: Retrieves user and company information, handling 'ADMIN' access. This function was later refined with explicit TypeScript interfaces and parameterized queries for better type safety and security (5:09:52 PM).
    *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses based on display preferences (month, week, quarter).
    *   `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Selects specific columns for Excel exports based on report name and booking status.
    *   `dateFilterOnExport`: Filters out invalid dates and formats valid dates for export.
    *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A constant array defining the structure for exported columns.

*   **`src\common\util\export.query.ts` (Multiple updates from 10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM to 6:05:51 PM):** This new utility file contains complex, hardcoded SQL query fragments for various booking-related reports.
    *   `getMonthValue`: A helper to convert month names to numeric values.
    *   `bookingQuery`: Generates dynamic SQL `WHERE` clauses and additional `SELECT` columns based on report name, company name, and time-based filtering (month, week, quarter). This function heavily relies on string interpolation, making it a potential area for SQL injection if input parameters are not thoroughly sanitized.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics Feature Development:** The overwhelming majority of changes are dedicated to building a comprehensive analytics module, covering custom dashboard creation, metric selection, layout, and data export.
*   **Timestamp Concentration:** All recorded changes occurred on the same day (October 22, 2025), indicating a focused development effort or a single commit representing a large feature implementation.
*   **SQL Query Construction:** A recurring pattern is the dynamic construction of SQL queries using string interpolation in many service and utility files (`coreViewService`, `coreMetricService`, `analyticsExportService`, `export.query.ts`). While some efforts were made towards parameterized queries in `coreViewService` and `getUserObject`, several critical areas (like `DELETE` in `coreViewService`, `saveSequence`, `saveSize` in `coreMetricService`, and the entirety of `bookingQuery`) still rely on direct string concatenation with user-supplied values, presenting potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Modeling Evolution:** New TypeScript interfaces (`CheckBoxDetails`, `MenuRow`, `DashboardItem`, `MetricListDataI`, `MetricRow`) were progressively introduced and refined, reflecting a growing and more defined data model for analytics entities.
*   **Route Centralization:** The `Paths.ts` constant serves as a central registry for all API endpoints, ensuring consistency and ease of management.
*   **Logging:** `logger.info` and `logger.error` calls are prevalent across new service files, suggesting an emphasis on monitoring and debugging.
*   **Date Handling:** Utility functions for date range defaults and formatting show a consistent approach to date-related data processing.
*   **Value Normalization:** Functions like `replaceColumnHandler` in `analyticsExportService` and `replaceValueInQuery` in `analytics.ts` indicate a need to standardize or adjust specific string values (e.g., location names like "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES").

The overall pattern indicates a centralized analytics routing file that aggregates various data visualization, reporting, configuration, and user preference functionalities, drawing from multiple specialized analytics controllers.

## 11:32:02 AM
The changes primarily revolve around the enhancement and expansion of the analytics and reporting functionalities within the `t360-backend-v2` project. A new `Analytics` module has been introduced, covering dashboard views, metrics, and data export.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 12:19:46 PM):**
    *   Significant expansion of the `Analytics` base path with new endpoints.
    *   New analytics endpoints include `/dashboards` (Get), `/create`, `/update`, `/delete-view`, `/dashboardEndPoints`, `/metricsList`, `/excelExport`, `/save-sequence`, `/save_size`, `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, and `/Tables/tableData`.
    *   Other modules like `Users`, `Auth`, `Dashboard`, `Shipment`, `Autocom`, `Booking`, `Reports`, `User`, and `Notification` also see minor additions or updates to their respective paths, indicating continued development across the application.

*   **`src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 12:20:38 PM to 4:38:37 PM):**
    *   **Initial setup (12:20:38 PM):** The `AnalyticsRoutes` were initially configured to use `getDashboardCardInfo` and `getDeliveryData` from `dashboardService`, suggesting an initial overlap or placeholder.
    *   **Refactoring and integration (12:33:16 PM - 12:34:42 PM):** The route definitions were progressively refined.
        *   `getDashboardCardInfo` was removed.
        *   `getAll` from `coreViewService` was integrated for `Paths.Analytics.Get`.
        *   Routes for creating, updating, and deleting analytics views (`create`, `update`, `deleteView` from `coreViewService`) were added.
    *   **Integration of CoreMetricService (4:13:43 PM - 4:38:37 PM):**
        *   `dashboardEndPointList` from `coreMetricService` was added to `Paths.Analytics.DashboardEndPoints`.
        *   `getMetricList` from `coreMetricService` was assigned to `Paths.Analytics.MetricsList`.
        *   `saveSequence` and `saveSize` from `coreMetricService` were added as POST routes for `Paths.Analytics.SaveSequence` and `Paths.Analytics.SaveSize`, respectively.
        *   `getExportData` from `analyticsExportService` was introduced for `Paths.Analytics.GetExcelReport`.
    *   **Pattern:** Multiple endpoints (`GetExcelReport`, `Get`, `Get`) were assigned the `getAll` handler, which might indicate temporary assignments or a design where `getAll` serves as a generic fallback or initial handler.

*   **`src\routes\index.ts` (Timestamp: 10/22/2025, 12:21:23 PM):**
    *   The main API router (`apiRouter`) was updated to include `AnalyticsRoutes` under `Paths.Analytics.Base`, formally integrating the new analytics module into the application's routing structure.

*   **`src\models\common\types\analytics.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 12:27:34 PM to 4:36:01 PM):**
    *   Introduction and iterative expansion of analytics-related TypeScript interfaces.
    *   **`CheckBoxDetails`:** Defines `checked` and `metricsId`.
    *   **`MenuRow`:** Initially `menu_title`, then expanded to include `metricsId`, `dashboard_metrics`, and `size`. This suggests storing details about dashboard configuration and layout.
    *   **`DashboardItem`:** Added to define structure for dashboard elements with `id`, `name`, `end_point`, and `dashboard_name`.
    *   **`MetricListDataI`:** Added for metric list data, including `id`, `name`, `group`, `filter_by`, and an optional `checked` status.
    *   **`MetricRow`:** A simple interface for `id` and `name` of a metric.
    *   **Pattern:** Consistent evolution of types to support increasingly complex dashboard and metric management, including display properties and data filtering.

*   **`src\services\coreViewService.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 12:26:53 PM to 12:46:12 PM):**
    *   **Initial implementation (12:26:53 PM):** Introduced `getAll`, `create`, `update`, `deleteView` functions for managing user dashboards (`dashboards` table). It also included a `logAudit` function to record changes to analytics views in `analytics_view_log`.
    *   **Type refinement and database parameterization (12:31:11 PM - 12:46:12 PM):**
        *   Improved type annotations, e.g., using `IAuthReq` for requests and `Response, NextFunction` for Express handlers.
        *   Added imports for `CheckBoxDetails` and `MenuRow`.
        *   Database queries for `create` and `update` were refactored to use parameterized queries (`$1, $2, $3::int[]`) instead of direct string interpolation for better security and type handling (e.g., `ARRAY[${metricsIdsArray}]` became `$3::int[]`).
        *   Nullish coalescing operator (`user?.usercode`) was consistently applied for user-related properties.

*   **`src\services\coreMetricService.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 4:11:45 PM to 4:38:20 PM):**
    *   **Introduction of metric-related services:**
        *   **`dashboardEndPointList`:** Fetches dashboard metrics, their order, and size from the `dashboards` table for a given user and menu title, then queries `metrics` table to retrieve details. It also sorts the results based on `dashboard_metrics` order and formats them with `rowSpan` and `columnSpan`.
        *   **`getMetricList`:** Retrieves a list of all available metrics from the `metrics` table, categorizes them into `Container_Wise` and `MBL_Wise` groups, and optionally preloads checked states based on an existing dashboard's configuration.
        *   **`saveSequence`:** Saves the order of reports (metrics) for a specific user and dashboard (`menu_title`). Handles "Default" dashboard creation if it doesn't exist and updates `dashboard_metrics`.
        *   **`saveSize`:** Allows users to save `columnSpan` and `rowSpan` properties for individual metrics within a dashboard. It fetches existing size data, updates it for a specific metric, and persists it back to the `dashboards` table.
    *   **Pattern:** Heavy reliance on the `metrics` and `dashboards` database tables for configuration and retrieval of analytics data. Robust error handling and logging are consistently applied. Type definitions from `analytics.ts` are actively used for data structures.

*   **`src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 4:40:11 PM to 10/23/2025, 11:04:38 AM):**
    *   **Introduction of `getExportData`:** This function is responsible for generating data for Excel export.
    *   It takes various query parameters (`fromDate`, `toDate`, `reportName`, `columns`, `booking`, etc.) to construct dynamic SQL queries.
    *   It uses `getUserObject` to get company-specific user info.
    *   It dynamically selects columns using `columnsQuery` and attempts to save the selected columns using `saveColumns`.
    *   It distinguishes between `booking` and `nonBooking` reports, calling `bookingQuery` or `nonBookingQuery` accordingly.
    *   Includes specific logic for "TEU MBLwise" reports to handle duplicate container entries.
    *   **`replaceColumnHandler`:** A utility function introduced to replace specific values (e.g., "LONG BEACH" with "LOS ANGELES") in the exported data for `pod` and `place_of_delivery` columns.
    *   **Pattern:** Focus on dynamic SQL query construction for reporting, data transformation, and date handling. Error handling and logging are present.

*   **`src\common\util\export.query.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM to 10/22/2025, 6:05:51 PM):**
    *   Introduced `getMonthValue` helper for converting month names/numbers.
    *   Defines `bookingQuery` function, which generates complex SQL query fragments based on `reportName`, `CompanyName`, and various filters (month, week, quarter, stacked group, display by). This function builds parts of the main query used by `analyticsExportService`.
    *   **Pattern:** Contains extensive, hardcoded SQL query strings for specific report types, indicating a report-driven database interaction model.

*   **`src\utils\analytics.ts` (Multiple Timestamps: 10/22/2025, 4:43:56 PM to 10/22/2025, 5:11:25 PM):**
    *   **`defaultDateRange`:** Utility to provide a default date range (current date to 365 days prior).
    *   **`replaceValueInQuery`:** Helper to generate SQL `CASE` statements for column value replacement (e.g., `pod` from 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES').
    *   **`getUserObject`:** Retrieves user information, potentially adjusting `usercode` and `companyname` based on `access` rights (e.g., for ADMINs).
    *   **`getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`:** Generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `dateTrunc`, and `SELECT` clauses based on how data should be displayed (month, week, quarter).
    *   **`getExcelSelectedColumns`:** Selects appropriate columns for Excel export based on `reportName` and `isBooking` flag. It includes common, booking-specific, and other detailed columns.
    *   **`isValidDate` and `dateFilterOnExport`:** Utilities for validating date strings and formatting date fields within data objects for export.
    *   **`EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`:** A large array defining the columns and their display names for Excel exports.
    *   **Pattern:** Contains a collection of helper functions and constants crucial for analytics processing, data manipulation, date handling, and SQL query generation. There's a strong focus on ensuring data quality and appropriate formatting for reporting.

*   **10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM:** First commit of `export.query.ts` containing complex, report-specific SQL query fragments.
*   **10/22/2025, 5:09:52 PM:** `analytics.ts` (utils) receives significant type and utility function improvements, including robust date handling and user object processing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Analytics-Centric Development:** The overwhelming majority of changes are dedicated to building out a robust analytics system, including custom dashboards, metric management, and data export.
2.  **Modular Structure:** The use of `Paths.ts` for constants, dedicated route files, service layers (`coreViewService`, `coreMetricService`, `analyticsExportService`), and utility files (`analytics.ts`, `export.query.ts`) indicates a clear attempt at modular and organized code.
3.  **Database Interaction:** There's a strong pattern of direct database querying (using a `query` utility) for all analytics operations, including fetching, creating, updating, and deleting dashboards/metrics, and generating reports. SQL queries are often dynamic, constructed from multiple parameters.
4.  **Type Safety (TypeScript):** Progressive addition and refinement of TypeScript interfaces (`CheckBoxDetails`, `MenuRow`, `DashboardItem`, `MetricListDataI`, `MetricRow`, `User`, `UserRow`, `AnalyticsControllerQuery`, `saveSeqI`, `SizeData`, `DataItem`) throughout the changes, particularly in service files and models, highlight an effort to improve code maintainability and reduce runtime errors.
5.  **Logging and Error Handling:** `logger.info(error)` and `res.status(500).json({ message: "Internal Server Error" })` are consistently present in `try-catch` blocks across all service functions, indicating a focus on operational stability and debugging.
6.  **User-Specific Customization:** Features like saving dashboard view sequences, metric sizes, and fetching user-specific dashboard data indicate a strong emphasis on personalized analytics experiences.
7.  **Dynamic Query Generation:** Several utilities (`columnsQuery`, `bookingQuery`, `nonBookingQuery`, `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`) are designed to construct SQL queries dynamically based on user input or report type.
8.  **Data Transformation:** Functions like `dateFilterOnExport` and `replaceColumnHandler` are used to clean, format, and transform data before it's sent to the client, especially for exports.
9.  **Auditing:** The `logAudit` function in `coreViewService` indicates that changes to user-defined dashboards are being tracked for accountability.

## 3:14:26 PM
The `analytics.route.ts` file, updated on 10/22/2025 at 11:01:53 AM, defines a comprehensive set of API routes for an analytics module.

**File-Specific Updates:**
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts`**: This file acts as a central router for analytics functionalities. It imports a wide array of controllers from the `analytics` directory, including `core.view.controller`, `core.metric.controller`, `cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`, `teu.controller`, `container.controller`, `transit.controller`, `others.controller`, and `core.export.controller`.
*   The routes cover:
    *   **Dashboard Management**: Full CRUD operations (GET all, POST create, PUT update, DELETE) are exposed under `/dashboards`.
    *   **Metric and Endpoint Discovery**: Endpoints like `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are available to retrieve lists of available analytics endpoints and metrics.
    *   **Data Export**: A route `/excelExport` is defined for exporting data.
    *   **User Preferences**: Routes `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` allow users to save their preferences related to display sequence and size.
    *   **Specific Reports**: Dedicated GET routes are provided for various reports, including `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and a general `/Tables/tableData` endpoint, each handled by its respective controller.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The API design follows a RESTful pattern, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations on resources like `dashboards`.
*   There's a clear modularity, with different analytics concerns (views, metrics, CBM, KGS, etc.) being handled by separate, dedicated controllers and then aggregated into this single router file.
*   Many routes are specifically for retrieving analytical reports (e.g., `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`), indicating a strong focus on data reporting.
*   The timestamps consistently show changes happening on 10/22/2025, suggesting a single session or a concentrated period of development activity for these changes.

## 3:15:30 PM
The core of these changes centers around the development and refinement of a new "Analytics" feature set within the T360-V2 backend, predominantly occurring on **October 22, 2025**.

**Key Information by File:**

*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/22/2025, 12:19:46 PM
    *   A significant expansion of API endpoints was introduced under a new `Analytics` section.

The provided log details a significant update to the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` file, timestamped 10/22/2025, 11:01:53 AM.

This update introduces a comprehensive set of API routes for an analytics module. Key aspects include:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for `/dashboards` are defined, utilizing a `core.view.controller`.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Listing:** Routes `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are added to fetch lists of available analytics endpoints and metrics, respectively.
*   **Data Export:** A new route `/excelExport` is included, pointing to `core.export.controller` for exporting data.
*   **User Preferences:** Routes `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` are implemented, likely for persisting user display preferences within the analytics interface.
*   **Specific Report Endpoints:** A variety of specialized GET routes are introduced for different types of reports, including `/cbm` (CBM reports), `/kgs` (KGS reports), `/teu` (TEU reports), `/containers` (Container reports), `/transit` (Transit reports), and `/Tables/tableData` (general table data reports). Each of these points to a dedicated controller (e.g., `cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`).

The overall pattern indicates a major expansion of the backend's analytics capabilities, consolidating various reporting, dashboard management, and user preference functionalities into a single, well-structured routing file. The extensive list of imported controllers for `cbm`, `kgs`, `teu`, `container`, `transit`, `others`, `core.view`, `core.metric`, and `core.export` highlights the module's broad scope and specialized reporting functions.

## 4:14:32 PM
The `AnalyticsScreen.jsx` file received a significant update on **10/23/2025, 3:18:36 PM**. This file serves as the main analytics dashboard screen, heavily relying on Redux for state management and Redux Toolkit Query for data fetching.

Key updates and features in this file include:

*   **Imports and Dependencies**: Expanded imports to include `moment` for date handling, several Redux Toolkit Query hooks (`useFetchDashboardsQuery`, `useLazyFetchEndpointsQuery`, `useLazyFetchReportQuery`), and various Redux actions (`setAllMetric`, `setCustomer`, `setDashboard`, `setEndpoints`, `setLoading`) for managing analytics-related state. UI components from `@mui/material` and local common/screen components are also utilized.
*   **Data Fetching Logic**:
    *   It fetches available dashboards using `useFetchDashboardsQuery` based on the user's company and role.
    *   A complex `useEffect` handles the dynamic fetching of analytics endpoints (either `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` for 'Default' dashboard or custom ones via `fetchEndpoints`) and subsequently fetches reports for all determined endpoints in parallel using `Promise.all` and `fetchReport`.
    *   Report queries include parameters like `apiKey` (hardcoded as "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"), `reportName`, `userid`, date range (initialized with `dateFilterHandle("year_2_date")`), `displayBy`, `viewBy`, `companyname`, and `access`.
    *   Loading states are managed using `setLoading` actions around the data fetching.
    *   Fetched report data is processed using `metricsPackageHandler` before being dispatched to the Redux store via `setAllMetric`.
*   **State Management**: Extensive use of `useSelector` to access `mainState` (analytics slice), `settingsState`, and `user` authentication details. `useDispatch` is used to update various parts of the analytics state.
*   **User Role-Based Logic**:
    *   Dashboard fetching is conditioned by `user.role`.
    *   An `useEffect` automatically sets the customer if the `user.role` is 'CUSTOMER'.
    *   The UI conditionally renders an `Alert` if the `user.role` is 'ADMIN' and no customer is selected, prompting the user to select one.
*   **UI Structure**: The component renders a `ScreenToolbar` with a `ThemedBreadcrumb` and an `AnalyticsToolbar`. The main content area conditionally displays an alert, a `Loader`, or the `AnalyticsContainer` based on user role, selected customer, and loading status.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   **Redux-centric Data Flow**: The component heavily relies on Redux for managing global state and orchestrating data fetching and updates.
*   **Redux Toolkit Query**: Consistent use of RTK Query for declarative and efficient API interaction.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: Logic for rendering UI elements often depends on `user.role`, `mainState` properties, and loading indicators.
*   **Hardcoded API Key**: The `apiKey: "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"` within the `fetchReport` query is a recurring detail, suggesting it might be a development placeholder or a key shared across multiple report requests.
*   **Date Handling with Moment**: `moment` is utilized for consistent date formatting in API requests.
