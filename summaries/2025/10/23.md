# Activity Summary for 10/23/2025

## 10:31:45 AM
The provided log details changes to the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` file, with the last recorded update on **October 22, 2025, at 11:01:53 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates (`analytics.route.ts`):**

This file is responsible for defining the API routes for the analytics module within the `t360-backend` application. The changes indicate a comprehensive setup for analytics functionalities, including:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are exposed for dashboards via `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests to `/dashboards`. These operations are handled by the `core.view.controller`.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Listing:** Routes are provided to fetch lists of dashboard endpoints (`/dashboardEndPoints`) and available metrics (`/metricsList`), using `GET` requests and handled by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **Data Export:** An endpoint `/excelExport` is available for exporting data via a `GET` request, managed by `core.export.controller`.
*   **User Preferences:** Functionality to save user preferences, specifically `saveSequence` and `saveSize`, is exposed through `POST` requests to `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` respectively, also managed by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **Reporting:** A variety of specific data reports are exposed via `GET` requests, each handled by its dedicated controller:
    *   `/cbm` for CBM reports (`cbm.controller`)
    *   `/kgs` for KGS reports (`kgs.controller`)
    *   `/teu` for TEU reports (`teu.controller`)
    *   `/containers` for Container reports (`container.controller`)
    *   `/transit` for Transit reports (`transit.controller`)
    *   `/Tables/tableData` for general table data reports (`others.controller`)

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

A clear pattern observed is the modular organization of analytics functionalities. Different aspects of analytics (view management, metric management, CBM, KGS, TEU, container, transit reports, and export) are separated into distinct controller files. This `analytics.route.ts` file then acts as an aggregator, importing functions from these controllers and mapping them to specific API endpoints. The majority of the routes are `GET` requests for retrieving data and reports, while `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are used for managing dashboard resources and saving user preferences.
