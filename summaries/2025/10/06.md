# Activity Summary for 10/6/2025

## 10:42:08 AM
The provided log details a series of rapid changes made to a single file, `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`, all occurring within a few minutes on 10/6/2025, specifically between 9:45:19 AM and 9:47:19 AM.

**File-Specific Updates (`customerService.ts`):**

The modifications are concentrated within the `CreateCustomer` asynchronous function, specifically targeting how the `status` of a customer is handled during an update operation.

*   **Initial State (9:45:19 AM):** The `CreateCustomer` function updates the `customer` table's `status` directly using the provided `status` from the request body. A commented line suggested a potential `toUpperCase()` conversion.
*   **9:45:35 AM:** The `status` value for the `customer` update query was explicitly converted to uppercase using `toUpperCase()`. A minor typo (`cons`) was inadvertently introduced before the `if (status)` block.
*   **9:45:46 AM:** The `cons` typo was removed, and debugging `console.log` statements were added to inspect `documentsRaw` and `status` values, indicating active debugging. The `toUpperCase()` conversion for `status` remained in effect.
*   **9:46:23 AM:** The entire `if (status)` conditional block responsible for updating the customer status was commented out, and the `status` value was reverted to being used directly without any case conversion (`toUpperCase()` was removed from the update line). This likely represents a temporary test or rollback during development.
*   **9:47:19 AM:** The `if (status)` block was uncommented and re-enabled. The `status` value is now explicitly converted to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` before being used in the `UPDATE` query, signifying a change in the desired case for status values in the database.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a focused iteration on the `CreateCustomer` function, particularly around the `status` field. The recurring elements include:

*   **Status Case Conversion:** Repeated modifications involve toggling, adding, or changing the case conversion (uppercase, then no conversion, then lowercase) applied to the `status` field before persisting it to the database.
*   **Debugging Statements:** The presence and removal of `console.log` statements across different timestamps suggest active debugging and testing during this development phase.
*   **Transaction Management:** The `CreateCustomer` function consistently uses `await query("BEGIN")` and intends to `await query("COMMIT")` on success or `await query("ROLLBACK")` on error, ensuring data integrity for the complex multi-table inserts.
*   **Auditing:** `simpleAudit` is consistently used after inserting `customer_gst_location` entries, indicating a structured approach to logging changes.
