# Activity Summary for 10/12/2025

## 10:43:33 PM
The `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` file underwent a series of focused updates around the timestamp of December 10, 2025, specifically concerning the handling of the `type` field within the customer's GST location information.

**File-specific updates for `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`:**
The modifications primarily target the `onSubmit` handler of the Formik form, specifically how the `type` property is assigned to the `gstRow` object, which represents `CustomerInfo`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
*   **10/12/2025, 6:08:40 PM:** The initial state showed the `type` field for `gstRow` being directly assigned from `values.type`.
*   **10/12/2025, 6:24:57 PM:** A change was introduced to ensure the `type` field defaults to "direct" if `values.type` is null or undefined, using the nullish coalescing operator (`values.type ?? "direct"`).
*   **10/12/2025, 6:25:29 PM:** The assignment of the `type` field was further simplified and made explicit, hardcoding its value to `"direct"`, irrespective of `values.type`.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The recurring pattern is the progressive refinement of the `type` field's assignment logic in the `onSubmit` function. It evolves from a direct value assignment to including a fallback default, and finally to a fixed, hardcoded value. All changes are concentrated on this single property within the `CustomerInfo` object before dispatching the `addOrUpdateGST` action.
