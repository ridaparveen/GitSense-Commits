# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-thirdparty\src\routes\external.routes.ts` was updated on 10/30/2025, 3:40:26 PM. This file establishes external API routes using Express.js. It imports and utilizes controllers from `v1` of `shipments`, `bookings`, `7501_duties`, `invoice`, and `isf` modules.

The defined routes are:
*   `/test`: A GET endpoint that returns a protected message including `req.companyname`.
*   `/tracking`: A GET endpoint handled by `shipments.getAll`.
*   `/booking`: A GET endpoint handled by `bookings.getAll`.
*   `/7501_duties`: A GET endpoint handled by `duties.getAll`.
*   `/invoice`: A GET endpoint handled by `invoice.getAll`.
*   `/isf`: A GET endpoint handled by `isf.getAll`.

A clear pattern emerges where most external data retrieval routes (tracking, booking, duties, invoice, isf) consistently call a `getAll` method from their respective controllers, all residing under a `v1` directory, suggesting API versioning.
