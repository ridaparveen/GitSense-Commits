# Activity Summary for 10/28/2025

## 11:33:51 AM
The provided log details two rapid consecutive updates to the `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` file, a frontend component responsible for managing analytics dashboard functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**
    *   This component serves as a toolbar for an analytics dashboard, integrating with Redux for state management (e.g., `analyticSlice` for selected dashboard, filters, operation type).
    *   It handles various user interactions such as changing global filters, selecting dashboard views, and switching between 'move' and 'resize' operations for dashboard elements.
    *   It includes a `SelectCustomerPanel` that is conditionally rendered based on user permissions (`permission?.selectCustomer`).
    *   A `ChipsTabView` allows users to select different dashboard views, including a "New" button to create custom views via an `AppDrawer` containing a `ViewContainer`.
    *   Filtering capabilities are provided through `SelectBox` for predefined date options (`DATE_FILTER_OPTIONS`) and a `PopoverPanel` for custom date range selection.
    *   The core functionality updated in these logs revolves around the **PDF export feature**. The component provides a "Global PDF Export" button to download the dashboard content.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/28/2025, 11:30:32 AM:** This entry shows a comprehensive `AnalyticsToolbar` component. The `downloadDashboardPDF` function is present, utilizing `jspdf` and `html2canvas` to capture the `#metric-board` element, add a logo (`logo-v2.svg`), and export it as a landscape A4 PDF. Notably, there are several commented-out versions of this function, suggesting previous iterations or alternative approaches were explored. The active version attempts to add the logo with `logoImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";` and includes a comment "Convert to base64", implying a `getBase64Image` helper function is intended to be used or was recently removed/moved.
*   **10/28/2025, 11:32:09 AM:** Approximately 1.5 minutes after the first log, a specific helper function named `getBase64Image` was added to the file. This function takes an `HTMLImageElement` as input, draws it onto a canvas, and returns its content as a base64 encoded PNG data URL. This addition directly addresses the "Convert to base64" comment from the previous version of `downloadDashboardPDF` by providing the missing implementation, which is then immediately used to convert the logo before adding it to the PDF.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Refinement of PDF Export Logic:** The most prominent pattern is the iterative refinement of the `downloadDashboardPDF` function. The commented-out code blocks in the first log entry indicate active development, testing, and debugging related to PDF generation, specifically concerning image loading and placement (like the logo). The subsequent addition of `getBase64Image` shows a direct resolution to a potential issue or improvement in handling embedded images within the PDF, likely to ensure the logo loads correctly and avoids cross-origin restrictions in the final PDF.
*   **Redux and UI Component Integration:** The component consistently uses Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for managing application state related to analytics filters and dashboard configurations, and it heavily relies on `@mui/material` and custom common components (e.g., `SelectBox`, `SwitchTab`, `ChipsTabView`, `AppDrawer`) for its user interface.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Permissions:** The use of `permission?.selectCustomer` demonstrates a pattern of implementing access control and dynamic UI based on user roles or permissions.

## 12:34:15 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancements and refactorings within the analytics section of the application, spanning across toolbar functionality, metric box rendering, chart components, and application navigation.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 11:30:32 AM:** The `downloadDashboardPDF` function was updated to include a mechanism for embedding a logo (from `logo-v2.svg`) into the exported PDF, with initial error handling for image loading. It introduced `logoImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";` and used a `getBase64Image` function (though `getBase64Image` itself wasn't explicitly shown in this initial entry, its call for logo conversion was).
    *   **10/28/2025, 11:32:09 AM:** An explicit `getBase64Image` helper function was added to convert an `HTMLImageElement` to a base64 string, which is then used by `downloadDashboardPDF` for the logo.
    *   **10/28/2025, 11:35:22 AM & 10/28/2025, 11:35:46 AM:** There was a brief attempt to directly add `logoImg` to PDF without prior base64 conversion, but this was quickly reverted, reaffirming the `getBase64Image` approach.
    *   **10/28/2025, 11:36:52 AM:** The `logoImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";` property was commented out, potentially for testing its necessity for local assets.
    *   **10/28/2025, 11:40:13 AM:** A significant update to the PDF export logic was introduced. `html2canvas` options were configured for higher resolution (`scale: 2`), `useCORS`, and a `backgroundColor`. Crucially, multi-page PDF generation was implemented to handle content overflow, and a dynamic footer with the generation timestamp was added. `logoImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";` was uncommented again.
    *   **10/28/2025, 11:40:57 AM:** The extensive multi-page PDF generation logic introduced at 11:40:13 AM was reverted, simplifying the `downloadDashboardPDF` function back to a single-page export similar to previous versions, with `logoImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";` remaining commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:09:19 PM:** This file, defining the `MetricsBox` component, was present in its stable form. It conditionally renders various chart types (`BarChart`, `PieChart`, `LineChart`, `StackedBarChart`, `GaugeChart`) based on `chartType` and `chartView`. It includes functionality for displaying a subset of data (first 9 items) for the main view and full data for an "enlarged" modal view.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\BarChart.tsx`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:10:42 PM:** The initial version of the `BarChart` component was present, utilizing `ReactApexChart` to render horizontal bar charts. It handles data formatting using `applyFormatting`, disables tooltips, and conditionally enables animations for smaller datasets or when not exporting to PDF.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:11:26 AM:** A minor syntax correction was made to import `ApexOptions` as a named import: `import { ApexOptions } from "apexcharts";`.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:11:38 AM:** The component was refactored from a `React.FC` type declaration to an `export default function` syntax, removing `ApexOptions` import and potentially introducing a bug in the `dataLabels` formatter.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:12:12 PM:** The changes from 12:11:38 AM were reverted, restoring the `React.FC` syntax and `ApexOptions` import.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:12:47 PM:** The component reverted again to the `export default function` syntax (like 12:11:38 AM).
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:15:55 PM & 10/28/2025, 12:16:42 PM:** Attempts to modify the component declaration introduced syntax errors, indicating a struggle with the correct component definition syntax.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:17:07 PM:** The syntax errors were corrected, and the component reverted to the `export default function` syntax, similar to 12:12:47 PM.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:18:24 PM:** The component signature was finally stabilized to `export default function BarChart({ item, sizeInfo, exportPdf=false }: BarChartProps) { ... }`, providing explicit typing for props.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:19:56 PM & 10/28/2025, 12:20:08 PM:** Type annotations for `formatter` parameters in `dataLabels` were briefly added then removed, and `parseFloat(String(value))` was added to ensure value parsing robustness.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:20:18 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\config\menu.ts`**
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:24:58 PM:** The sidebar menu configuration was present, defining various navigation items grouped under headings like "Dashboard", "Operations", "Analytics", and "Settings". A "Dev" section was included, conditionally rendered based on `import.meta.env.VITE_MODE`.
    *   **10/28/2025, 12:27:00 PM:** The `href` for the "Analytics" menu item under the "Analytics" heading was updated from `/app/reports` to `/app/analytics`, creating a distinct route for this specific navigation item.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative PDF Export Refinement:** The `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` file shows a consistent effort to enhance the dashboard PDF export feature. This included adding a logo, improving image quality (via `html2canvas` scale), handling multi-page content, and adding footers. There was also some back-and-forth experimentation with how the logo image should be processed (e.g., direct image vs. base64 conversion) and whether `crossOrigin` is required.
*   **Chart Component Typing and Syntax Refinement:** `BarChart.tsx` underwent several rapid changes related to its component declaration and TypeScript typing. This indicates an ongoing process to standardize or correct the component's structure and prop handling.
*   **Analytics Feature Development:** All the modified JavaScript/TypeScript files are located within the `analytics` screen components (`AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, `metricBox.tsx`, `BarChart.tsx`), highlighting active development and improvements to the analytics dashboard features, including data visualization and export capabilities.
*   **Configuration for Navigation:** The `menu.ts` file demonstrates the application's structured approach to defining navigation, including conditional menu items for different environments.

## 12:34:38 PM
The provided log details changes across two service files, primarily focusing on database interactions and auditing.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\coreViewService.ts`

This file manages CRUD operations for user dashboards (`dashboards` table) and their associated audit logs (`analytics_view_log`).

*   **Initial State (10/28/2025, 11:44:58 AM)**:
    *   The service implements `getAll`, `create`, `update`, and `deleteView` functions for managing dashboards.
    *   A `logAudit` helper function is defined to record actions (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) on dashboards.
    *   Crucially, calls to `logAudit` within the `create`, `update`, and `deleteView` functions are initially *commented out*.
    *   The `create` function includes a check for existing dashboards before insertion.
    *   `update` retrieves `dashboard_metrics` before updating to potentially capture previous values.

*   **Minor Adjustment (10/28/2025, 11:48:01 AM)**:
    *   A `console.log` statement (`console.log("===reqbody===09",req.body);`) was added within the `update` function's `try` block for debugging purposes. Audit log calls remained commented out.

*   **Audit Logging Enabled for Update (10/28/2025, 11:52:08 AM)**:
    *   The `logAudit` call within the `update` function was *uncommented*. This enabled auditing for dashboard update operations, capturing `previousValue` and `newValue` of `dashboard_metrics`.

*   **No Change (10/28/2025, 12:00:36 PM)**:
    *   The content of the file is identical to the previous timestamp, indicating a save without further modifications at this point.

*   **Audit Logging Enabled for Delete (10/28/2025, 12:07:49 PM)**:
    *   The `logAudit` call within the `deleteView` function was *uncommented*. This activated auditing for dashboard deletion.
    *   Audit logging for the `create` function, however, remains commented out throughout the observed log entries.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\transitService.ts`

This file provides functionality to generate transit reports by querying a database.

*   **Initial Implementation (10/28/2025, 12:03:52 PM)**:
    *   Introduced the `getTransitReports` function, which fetches analytics data based on various query parameters (e.g., `group_by_column`, `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`, `viewBy`, `type`, `reportName`).
    *   Defined a specific `TransitReportQuery` interface to strongly type the expected request query parameters.
    *   Includes logic to set default date ranges if not provided.
    *   Dynamically builds SQL queries using `transitQueryBuilder` based on user input and `mblwiseCondition`.
    *   Utilized `logger.info` to log the constructed SQL query.
    *   The `getTransitReports` function signature was explicit about the `TransitReportQuery` interface.

*   **Refactoring and Simplification (10/28/2025, 12:06:29 PM)**:
    *   The explicit `TransitReportQuery` interface definition was removed.
    *   The `getTransitReports` function signature was simplified to `(req: IAuthReq, res: Response)`, relying on `IAuthReq` for request typing, making query parameters less explicitly typed.
    *   Detailed comments within the function were removed.
    *   The `logger.info` call for the main query was changed to `logger.error`, potentially indicating a debugging step or a change in logging strategy.
    *   A minor typo was introduced in the response object's key: `analyticsData` was changed to `analysticsData`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Database Interaction**: Both services heavily rely on a `query` utility function for all database operations, indicating a centralized database access layer.
*   **User Context**: User information (`req.user`, `user?.usercode`, `user.firstname`, `userObj`) is consistently extracted and used for database queries, auditing, and report generation, highlighting a user-centric design.
*   **Error Handling**: Both services implement `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during asynchronous operations, logging errors with a `logger` utility and returning a 500 "Internal Server Error" status.
*   **Logging**: A `logger` utility is used for both informational messages and errors, though its usage and level changed in `transitService.ts`.
*   **Progressive Auditing**: In `coreViewService.ts`, there's a clear pattern of progressively enabling `logAudit` calls, suggesting a phased approach to implementing or activating audit trails. The `create` audit log remaining commented out is a notable inconsistency in this pattern.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation**: `transitService.ts` specifically shows dynamic SQL query construction based on various input parameters, which is a common pattern for flexible reporting features.

## 3:13:37 PM
The provided log details changes to the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.view.controller.ts` at `10/28/2025, 1:58:56 PM`.

This file, `core.view.controller.ts`, is responsible for managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to analytics dashboard views.

**File-Specific Updates and Functionalities:**

*   **`getAll`**: This function retrieves all dashboard titles (`menu_title`) associated with the authenticated user (`user_id`) from the `dashboards` table. It returns an array of these titles.
*   **`create`**: Allows for the creation of a new dashboard view. It takes a `dashboardName` and `checkBoxManager` (which provides `metricsId`s). Before creation, it checks for existing views with the same name for the user. If the view doesn't exist, it inserts the new dashboard's details, including `user_id`, `menu_title`, and an array of `dashboard_metrics`, into the `dashboards` table.
*   **`update`**: Facilitates the modification of an existing dashboard. It updates both the `dashboard_metrics` and `menu_title` for a specific dashboard identified by its `currentDashboardPath` and the `user_id`. It also fetches the old data before updating for audit purposes.
*   **`deleteView`**: Handles the removal of a dashboard view based on its `menu_title` and the `user_id`.
*   **`logAudit`**: A dedicated helper function `logAudit` has been introduced and integrated into the `create`, `update`, and `deleteView` operations. This function records audit trails in an `analytics_view_log` table, detailing the `user_id`, `action` (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE), `menu_title`, `previous_value`, `new_value`, and `created_by` (user's first name).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **User Authentication**: All controller functions rely on an `AuthenticatedRequest` and utilize `req.user.usercode` to identify the user for all database operations, ensuring data segregation per user.
*   **Database Interaction**: The `query` function from `../../config/database` is consistently used for all database interactions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
*   **Data Structure**: Dashboard configurations (metrics) are stored as an array of IDs (`dashboard_metrics`) within the `dashboards` table.
*   **Error Handling**: Each asynchronous operation includes a `try...catch` block, consistently returning a `500 Internal Server Error` JSON response on failure.
*   **Audit Logging**: The pattern of logging all significant dashboard modifications (create, update, delete) via the `logAudit` function is a prominent recurring element, enhancing traceability and accountability.
*   **Request Body Usage**: `req.body` is extensively used to extract dashboard names, current paths, and checkbox manager details for creating and updating views.

## 3:13:42 PM
The provided log details changes across two interconnected React components related to managing custom analytics views in the `t360-frontend` application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/28/2025, 2:02:33 PM
    *   This component serves as the primary interface for creating, editing, and deleting custom analytics dashboards.
    *   It imports a wide array of UI components (Material UI, custom common components), Redux for state management, RTK Query for API interactions, and `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.
    *   Key functionalities include:
        *   Fetching available dashboard options and metrics (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`).
        *   Saving (POST/PUT) and deleting (`DELETE`) custom dashboards (`useSaveDasboardMutation`).
        *   Managing selected metrics using a `checkBoxManager` state, with a hard limit of 9 metrics per view.
        *   Validations for dashboard name and metric selection before saving.
        *   Integration with Redux to dispatch actions (`setDashboard`, `setRefetchAll`) upon successful operations.
        *   Conditional rendering for audit trail functionality and delete options when in "edit" mode.
        *   Uses `PopupAlert` for confirmation messages (e.g., before deletion) and an `AuditViewDrawer` for viewing audit logs.
        *   Dynamically pre-populates selected metrics when editing an existing view.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/28/2025, 2:04:34 PM
    *   This component is a reusable UI element that displays metrics in a hierarchical tree structure, integrated into `ViewContainer.jsx`.
    *   It utilizes `@mui/x-tree-view` components (`SimpleTreeView`, `TreeItem`) along with Material UI `Checkbox`.
    *   It receives `data` (the metrics), `handleCheckBoxClicked` (a callback function), and `checkBoxManager` (to determine checked state) as props from its parent.
    *   The component renders groups of metrics, and each individual metric includes a checkbox whose state and change events are managed by the parent component.
    *   It implements basic styling for scrolling within the tree view.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
Both changes occurred on **October 28, 2025**, within minutes of each other (2:02:33 PM and 2:04:34 PM). This close proximity suggests they are part of a single development effort, likely related to implementing or refining the custom analytics view feature.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Interdependence:** `ViewContainer.jsx` is the orchestrator, consuming and rendering two instances of `TreeViewContianer.jsx` to display "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" metrics.
*   **API Key Usage:** The `apiKey: "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"` and user-specific identifiers (`userid`, `companyname`, `access`) are consistently used across all RTK Query API calls in `ViewContainer.jsx`.
*   **Redux Integration:** `useSelector` and `useDispatch` are standard patterns for global state management in `ViewContainer.jsx`.
*   **Material UI Reliance:** Both components heavily leverage Material UI (MUI) components for their UI elements, contributing to a consistent design language.
*   **Callback Props:** The pattern of passing event handlers (like `handleCheckBoxClicked`) and state (`checkBoxManager`) down to child components (`TreeViewContianer`) is evident for managing interactivity.
*   **Toasting and Alerts:** `react-hot-toast` and a custom `PopupAlert` component are used for consistent user feedback on success, error, and confirmation messages.
*   **Feature Focus:** Both files are specifically located within and contribute to the "analytics custom-view" functionality.

## 4:13:49 PM
The provided log details significant updates across three core analytics files within the `t360-backend` project, focusing on dashboard management, query generation, and metric customization.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.view.controller.ts`**
**Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 1:58:56 PM**
This file, responsible for dashboard view management, was extensively updated to include full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
*   The `getAll` function retrieves a user's dashboard `menu_title`s.
*   The `create` function allows users to save new dashboards, ensuring unique titles per user and storing selected `metricsIdsArray`. It includes audit logging.
*   The `update` function modifies existing dashboards, updating both `menu_title` and `dashboard_metrics`. Audit logs are generated, capturing both `previousValue` and `newValue` of metrics.
*   The `deleteView` function removes a specified dashboard and also logs the action.
*   A new `logAudit` helper function was introduced to standardize the logging of these actions into an `analytics_view_log` table, recording `user_id`, `action`, `menu_title`, `previous_value`, `new_value`, and `created_by`.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\export.query.ts`**
**Timestamps: 10/28/2025, 3:38:52 PM and 10/28/2025, 3:40:05 PM**
This file defines `bookingQuery`, a function that dynamically generates complex SQL query snippets for various analytics reports.
*   A `getMonthValue` utility function was added to convert textual month names (e.g., "Jan") to numerical month values for database queries.
*   The `bookingQuery` object contains a mapping of report names (e.g., "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)") to their respective SQL fragments.
*   These SQL fragments frequently calculate `day_diff` between dates and include extensive conditional logic (`stackedExport`, `displayBy`, `stackedGroup`) to tailor the queries based on user selections.
*   Common filters include `CompanyName`, MBL numbers, and checks for valid/non-null dates.
*   A specific change noted in the earlier timestamp was the addition of `AND m.t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date IS NOT NULL` to the "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)" query.
*   The second timestamp for this file indicates no functional changes, suggesting a minor save operation.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.metric.controller.ts`**
**Timestamps: 10/28/2025, 3:49:50 PM and 10/28/2025, 3:50:57 PM**
This controller was enhanced to provide more granular control and customization over how metrics are displayed on dashboards.
*   The `getMetricList` function now fetches all available metrics, organizes them into `containerWise` and `mblWise` groups based on their `filter_by` property, and supports preloading the `checked` status of metrics for a given dashboard.
*   The `dashboardEndPointList` function retrieves and sorts the specific metrics associated with a dashboard's `menuTitle`, also fetching their `rowSpan` and `columnSpan` display properties.
*   A new `saveSequence` function allows users to define and save the display order of reports (metrics) on their dashboards, updating the `dashboard_metrics` array. It includes special handling for a 'Default' dashboard, creating it if it doesn't exist.
*   Another new function, `saveSize`, was added to enable users to customize the grid layout of individual reports by setting their `columnSpan` and `rowSpan` properties. This data is stored in a `size` JSONB column in the `dashboards` table.
*   The later timestamp for this file includes a minor debugging `console.log` statement in `getMetricList` but no other functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **User-Centric Customization:** A strong recurring theme is the emphasis on user-specific dashboard customization, including the creation/deletion of personalized views, ordering of metrics, and setting display sizes, all linked to `user_id`.
*   **Database Interaction:** All changes heavily involve interactions with a PostgreSQL database, particularly the `dashboards` and `metrics` tables, using direct SQL queries. Array fields (`dashboard_metrics`) and JSONB fields (`size`) are utilized for flexible data storage.
*   **Audit Logging:** The introduction of explicit audit logging for dashboard view changes indicates a focus on accountability and tracking user actions.
*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** The `export.query.ts` file exemplifies a pattern of building flexible SQL queries programmatically based on multiple input parameters, which is essential for varied reporting needs.
*   **Error Handling:** All API endpoints consistently wrap their logic in `try...catch` blocks to handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP error responses.

## 4:13:55 PM
The log entries detail recent development activities focusing on analytics custom views and planboard functionalities within a frontend application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 2:02:33 PM and 3:48:07 PM)**
    *   This component, `ViewContainer.jsx`, is central to managing custom analytics dashboards. It enables users to create, edit, save, and delete views.
    *   Key features include: state management for checkbox selections (allowing a maximum of 9 metrics), view name input, toast notifications for success/error, and confirmation alerts for deletion.
    *   It integrates with Redux for state management (e.g., `setDashboard`, `setRefetchAll`) and utilizes RTK Query for fetching dashboard options (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`) and performing save/delete operations (`useSaveDasboardMutation`).
    *   During an "edit" action, existing checked metrics are pre-selected using an `useEffect` hook.
    *   An "Audit" functionality is exposed through a drawer, `AuditViewDrawer`.
    *   The update at 3:48:07 PM included the addition of a `console.log("===jhhjkk",viewOptions);` statement, indicating debugging efforts.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 2:04:34 PM, 3:46:33 PM, and 3:46:51 PM)**
    *   This component, `TreeViewContianer.jsx`, is a helper for `ViewContainer`, responsible for rendering a hierarchical list of analytics metrics (Container Wise, MBL Wise) using `@mui/x-tree-view`.
    *   It displays checkboxes next to each metric, reflecting their selection status via `checkBoxManager` and triggering `handleCheckBoxClicked` on change.
    *   A temporary change at 3:46:33 PM introduced "kk" into a metric label (`innerItem.name}kk`), which was immediately reverted at 3:46:51 PM, suggesting quick UI testing or a momentary debug artifact.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\config\analytics.js` (Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 3:35:37 PM, 3:37:47 PM, and 3:38:11 PM)**
    *   This configuration file defines several arrays and objects crucial for analytics reports:
        *   `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`: Lists default analytics report names with their corresponding API URLs, typically grouped by a specific column (e.g., `scac_code`, `pol`).
        *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A comprehensive list of column definitions (key and display name) for Excel exports, covering various shipping details like file number, MBL, container details, dates, etc.
        *   `CargoReadyToETD10Days`: A smaller set of column definitions for a specific report.
        *   `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`: A large object mapping various report names (e.g., CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit Time, Chassis metrics, categorized by Container Wise and MBL Wise) to arrays representing their table headers.
    *   Between 3:35:37 PM and 3:37:47 PM, the `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` object was updated. Specifically, the "Containers Shipped " entry was removed, and new entries like "Container by Ocean Freight Carrier (SCAC)" and "Container by Port of Loading" were added or completed, indicating a refinement of report header definitions.
    *   The entry at 3:38:11 PM shows identical content to 3:37:47 PM, likely a non-functional save.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\planboard\PlanboardCardView.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 4:05:26 PM and 4:08:24 PM)**
    *   This component, `PlanboardCardView.jsx`, handles the display of planboard data in either a yearly or monthly card view.
    *   It fetches planboard data (`useFetchPlanboardQuery`), applies filters based on user selections (`cardFilters` from Redux), and prepares filter objects for external use.
    *   It conditionally renders `YearViewItem` or `MonthViewItem` components.
    *   Includes a `NoDataAvailable` component which displays a message "No Data Available123" when there's no data, where "123" might be a temporary test string.
    *   The update at 4:08:24 PM included the addition of a `console.log("===planboardData",planboardData);` statement, indicating debugging.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/28/2025, 2:02:33 PM:** Initial significant commit for `ViewContainer.jsx`, introducing core custom dashboard management logic.

    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 2:04:34 PM:** This entry shows a React component designed to display hierarchical data (analytics metrics) in a tree view. It renders groups of items, each with a checkbox to manage selection, and communicates these selections back to its parent component via `handleCheckBoxClicked`. It also includes a `console.log` for debugging the `data` prop.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 3:46:33 PM:** A minor, likely temporary, cosmetic change was made by appending "kk" to the displayed `innerItem.name` within the tree view.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 3:46:51 PM:** The "kk" suffix added in the previous change was removed, reverting the label back to its original state.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\config\analytics.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 3:35:37 PM:** This file defines various constants crucial for analytics functionality, including default API endpoints for different CBM/TEU reports, a comprehensive list of columns for Excel exports, a specific set of columns for "Cargo Ready to ETD 10 Days," and a large `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` object mapping numerous report names to their corresponding table headers, categorized by metric (CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit, Chassis) and scope (Container Wise, MBL Wise).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 3:37:47 PM:** The `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` object was updated. A commented-out "Containers Shipped" entry was removed, and two new "Container Wise" metrics (`"Container by Ocean Freight Carrier (SCAC)"` and `"Container by Port of Loading"`) were added at the end of the object.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 3:38:11 PM:** This entry appears to be a resave or an identical commit to the previous one, showing no functional changes from `3:37:47 PM`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\planboard\PlanboardCardView.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 4:05:26 PM:** This React component is responsible for displaying planboard data in either a monthly or yearly card view. It fetches data, applies filters based on Redux state, and conditionally renders `MonthViewItem` or `YearViewItem` sub-components. It also includes a `NoDataAvailable` component with a distinct text suffix "123".
    *   **Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 4:08:24 PM:** A `console.log` statement was added to debug the `planboardData` after it's fetched.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The most significant changes occurred on **10/28/2025** between **2:02:33 PM** and **4:08:24 PM**. This timeframe indicates a focused development session on analytics view management and planboard display features, including:
*   Initial setup or major updates to `ViewContainer.jsx` and `TreeViewContianer.jsx` for analytics customization.
*   Refinement of analytics configuration (API endpoints, Excel columns, report headers) in `analytics.js`.
*   Development or debugging of `PlanboardCardView.jsx`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Activities:** A prominent pattern is the repeated addition of `console.log` statements (e.g., `console.log("===jhhjkk",viewOptions);`, `console.log("===tree",data);`, `console.log("===planboardData",planboardData);`) across multiple components. This suggests active development, testing, and troubleshooting of data flow and component states.
*   **MUI Component Usage:** All React components (ViewContainer, TreeViewContianer, PlanboardCardView) extensively use Material-UI (MUI) components for building the user interface, indicating a consistent frontend design system.
*   **Redux & RTK Query:** Both `ViewContainer` and `PlanboardCardView` rely on Redux for state management and RTK Query for interacting with backend APIs, demonstrating a standard approach to data handling in the application.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The analytics feature is broken down into `ViewContainer` (parent for view management) and `TreeViewContianer` (child for metric selection), showcasing a modular component structure.
*   **Configuration Management:** The `analytics.js` file serves as a central place for defining application-wide constants related to analytics reports, endpoints, and column mappings, promoting maintainability.
*   **Minor UI Tweaks/Reversions:** The temporary "kk" addition and removal in `TreeViewContianer.jsx` highlights typical iterative development where small UI changes are tested and then refined or reverted.

## 5:14:13 PM
The code changes detail significant updates across the analytics backend, focusing on dashboard management, metric configuration, and report generation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.view.controller.ts` (10/28/2025, 1:58:56 PM):** This file received comprehensive updates for managing user-defined dashboards.
    *   `getAll`: A new function to retrieve `menu_title`s for a user's dashboards.
    *   `create`: Allows creation of new dashboards, associating them with a `user_id`, `menu_title`, and an array of `dashboard_metrics`. It includes a check to prevent duplicate view names and integrates an audit logging mechanism.
    *   `update`: Enables modification of existing dashboards, updating both `dashboard_metrics` and `menu_title`. It logs the previous and new metric values for auditing purposes.
    *   `deleteView`: Implements the functionality to remove a dashboard and logs the deletion.
    *   `logAudit`: A new, centralized helper function was introduced to record all CRUD operations on dashboards in the `analytics_view_log` table, capturing `userId`, `action`, `menuTitle`, `previousValue`, `newValue`, and `user`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\export.query.ts` (10/28/2025, 3:38:52 PM and 3:40:05 PM):** This file contains SQL query definitions for various exportable analytics reports.
    *   `getMonthValue`: A utility function to convert month names (e.g., 'Jan') to numerical values.
    *   `bookingQuery`: A core function that dynamically constructs SQL queries based on a `reportName`. It supports numerous report types, including "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to Estimated Departure", and "Booking Date to POD Arrival", with variations for "MBL Wise" and "Stacked Bar" visualizations.
    *   The queries frequently join `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry` tables and apply filters based on `CompanyName` and valid date checks.
    *   "Stacked Bar" queries include complex conditional logic to filter data by month, week, or quarter and group results into predefined time difference categories (e.g., 'Less than 1 week', '1 - 2 weeks').
    *   The two entries at 3:38:52 PM and 3:40:05 PM show identical code, indicating no functional changes between those timestamps, likely just a save operation.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.metric.controller.ts` (10/28/2025, 3:49:50 PM and 3:50:57 PM):** This controller manages metric listings and dashboard layout configuration.
    *   `getMetricList`: Fetches all available metrics, categorizes them into 'Container_Wise' and 'MBL_Wise' groups, and further groups them by a generic `group` property. It includes a `preload` feature to mark metrics as 'checked' if they are already part of a specified dashboard.
    *   `dashboardEndPointList`: Retrieves the ordered list of reports (metric names and corresponding API endpoints) for a given dashboard, along with their `rowSpan` and `columnSpan` for layout.
    *   `saveSequence`: Allows users to reorder the metrics displayed on a dashboard. It maps report names to metric IDs and updates the `dashboard_metrics` array. A special case is handled for a 'Default' dashboard, creating it if it doesn't exist.
    *   `saveSize`: Persists the `columnSpan` and `rowSpan` properties for individual metrics on a dashboard, storing this layout information in a JSONB `size` column in the `dashboards` table.
    *   A minor debugging `console.log` was added to `getMetricList` at 3:50:57 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\mbls.query.ts` (Multiple timestamps from 4:22:21 PM to 5:12:38 PM):** This file underwent significant evolution, primarily affecting the `mblQueryBuilder` function.
    *   **Initial (4:22:21 PM):** `mblQueryBuilder` supported `ContainerShippedMblWise` (counting shipments and containers) and `TotalShipmentsMblWise` (counting shipments and MBLs), directly processing data and calculating percentages.
    *   **Subsequent Refinements (5:05:54 PM onwards):**
        *   The logic for `ContainerShippedMblWise` was entirely revamped. It now constructs a complex SQL query using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `completed_shipments`. This query calculates `container_count` grouped into 'Current Quarter', 'Last Quarter', and 'Other' based on dynamically determined quarter dates from `deliverd_date`.
        *   The `TotalShipmentsMblWise` type was renamed to `TotalShipments` and moved/removed, leaving `mblQueryBuilder` focused on the `ContainerShippedMblWise` report.
        *   The `customizer.selectedColumns.must` list was expanded with numerous tracking data fields for `ContainerShippedMblWise`.
        *   The `codeCustomization` flag, which initially indicated in-function data processing, was explicitly set to `true` but later commented out within the function itself (5:12:32 PM), suggesting a change in how `codeCustomization` is determined or handled by the calling controller. The core SQL query for `ContainerShippedMblWise` remained stable in the later timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts` (10/28/2025, 5:09:46 PM and 5:12:24 PM):** This file serves as a central dispatcher for analytics reports.
    *   It imports a suite of query builder functions (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`, `mblQueryBuilder`).
    *   The `getTableDataReports` function parses request parameters like `fromDate`, `toDate`, and `type` to determine which query builder to invoke.
    *   Initially, `generalQueryBuilder` handled `TotalShipments` and `TotalShipmentsMblWise`, and `mblQueryBuilder` handled `ContainerShippedMblWise`, both with `codeCustomization` set to `true` locally. This meant these builders processed data and returned rows directly.
    *   A key change at 5:12:24 PM updated the call to `mblQueryBuilder` for `ContainerShippedMblWise` to no longer explicitly set `codeCustomization = true`. This aligns with the `mbls.query.ts` change, suggesting `mblQueryBuilder` now implicitly performs custom data processing for this report type.
    *   Reports are conditionally dispatched, and if `codeCustomization` is false, a raw SQL query `mainQuery` is executed. Otherwise, the data processed by the builder is used directly.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database-Centric Operations:** The entire log demonstrates a heavy reliance on a `query` function for PostgreSQL database interactions across all functionalities (CRUD, data retrieval for reports).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A consistent `try-catch` block pattern is employed in controllers, logging errors using a `logger` and returning `500 Internal Server Error` responses.
*   **User and Company Context:** User details (`req.user`, `user.usercode`, `companyname`) are fundamental for data access, filtering, and personalization of dashboards and reports.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation:** SQL queries are frequently constructed dynamically using string interpolation, allowing for flexible filtering and data retrieval based on request parameters and user-specific data.
*   **Date and Time Management:** Extensive use of date parameters (`fromDate`, `toDate`) and specific date validation (`!= '0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'`) in SQL queries is prominent, indicating time-series analytics. Dynamic calculation of quarters (e.g., current, last) for reporting periods is also seen.
*   **Audit Logging:** The introduction of a dedicated `logAudit` function signals an increased focus on traceability and accountability for user actions within the analytics module.
*   **Conditional Code Execution (`codeCustomization`):** A recurring pattern is the `codeCustomization` flag, which determines whether a query builder directly processes and returns data or provides a raw SQL query string for the calling controller to execute. This pattern evolved, particularly for MBL-related queries.
