# Activity Summary for 10/25/2025

The `analytics.route.ts` file, last updated on 10/22/2025 at 11:01:53 AM, defines a comprehensive set of API routes for an analytics module within the `t360-backend` project.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for dashboards are exposed via `/dashboards` endpoints, managed by `core.view.controller`.
*   **Core Analytics Data:** Routes like `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are available to fetch lists of dashboard endpoints and metrics, respectively. An `/excelExport` endpoint is also provided for data export.
*   **User Preferences:** Endpoints `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` allow users to save preferences related to data display or layout.
*   **Specific Analytical Reports:** Dedicated routes are established for various report types, including `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and `/Tables/tableData`. Each of these points to a specific controller (e.g., `cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`) for fetching the relevant reports.

A clear pattern observed is the modular organization of controllers within the `src/controllers/analytics/` directory, with each specific report type or core functionality having its own dedicated controller file, and the routes directly mapping to these functionalities.
