# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 11:49:02 AM
The changes log details significant updates across several core functionalities, primarily focusing on expanded analytics and settings management.

In `src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM), numerous new API endpoints were introduced. The `Analytics` module saw a substantial expansion with paths for dashboard management (`/dashboards`, `/create`, `/update`, `/delete-view`, `/dashboardEndPoints`), metrics (`/metricsList`), and various report exports and data points (`/excelExport`, `/save-sequence`, `/save_size`, `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, `/Tables/tableData`). The `Settings` module also gained new paths for managing formats (`/format` with GET, POST, PUT) and grid configurations (`/grid-config` with GET, POST). Other modules like `User`, `Booking`, `Reports`, `Shipment`, and `Autocom` also received new, more granular endpoints, indicating a broad feature enhancement.

The `src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts` file (10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM) was updated to define routes for settings, including `Get`, `Post`, `Put` for format settings and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for grid configurations, based on the newly defined `Paths`. However, all these routes are currently incorrectly mapped to `getAll` from the `bookingService`, indicating an incomplete implementation or a placeholder error that needs correction.

The `src\services\setting-service.ts` file underwent several updates:
- The initial version (10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM) introduced a new service with functions to `getFormat`, `addFormat`, `updateFormat` for managing `format_settings` in the database, and `updateGridSettings`, `getGridSettings` for managing user-specific grid configurations in `grid_settings`. The `updateGridSettings` function includes logic to either insert a new setting or update an existing one based on `userid` and `screen`.
- A subsequent entry (10/27/2025, 11:00:20 AM) shows no functional changes, likely a re-save.
- A final update (10/27/2025, 11:01:18 AM) refactored the `addFormat` function to consistently use `IAuthReq` for authenticated requests, aligning it with other functions in the service, and removed unused imports like `AuthenticatedRequest` and `HttpError`.

In `src\utils\analytics.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM), a comprehensive set of utility functions for analytics and reporting was added. These include:
- `defaultDateRange`: Provides a default 365-day date range.
- `replaceValueInQuery`: A function to dynamically modify SQL query clauses, specifically for normalizing location data (e.g., transforming 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES').
- `getUserObject`: Fetches extended user information based on company and access level.
- `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for time-series aggregation by month, week, or quarter.
- `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Dynamically selects database columns for Excel reports based on report name and booking status, including specific logic for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI" reports.
- `isValidDate`: A helper to validate date strings.
- `dateFilterOnExport`: Processes data rows to replace invalid date values with `null` and optionally formats valid dates to "MM/DD/YYYY".
- `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A large array defining the display names and keys for columns intended for Excel exports, covering extensive shipment and booking details.

Finally, `src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM) introduced a new service responsible for handling analytics data exports. Its `getExportData` function:
- Processes various query parameters (date ranges, report names, display types, columns).
- Utilizes `defaultDateRange`, `getUserObject`, and `dateFilterOnExport` from the `analytics` utilities.
- Dynamically constructs complex SQL queries using external `bookingQuery` and `nonBookingQuery` functions, including `DISTINCT ON` clauses for specific report types.
- Post-processes the fetched data with `dateFilterOnExport` and `replaceColumnHandler`.
- Implements specific logic for "TEU" and "MBL" reports to handle container uniqueness.
- The `replaceColumnHandler` function explicitly transforms `pod` and `place_of_delivery` values from 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' in the final dataset, reinforcing the data normalization pattern seen in `analytics.ts`.

**Key patterns and recurring elements:**
- **Extensive Analytics and Reporting:** A major theme is the development of robust analytics features, including dynamic query building, date-based filtering, and highly customizable Excel exports.
- **Settings Management:** New capabilities for user-specific and general application settings.
- **Data Normalization:** A consistent pattern of transforming 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' for location fields (`pod`, `place_of_delivery`) appears in both utility and service layers, suggesting a business requirement for unifying these locations.
- **Database Utilities:** Heavy reliance on common `query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery` database utilities across new services.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of `logger.info` and `logger.error` and standard `res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" })` for error responses across services.
- **Modular API Design:** The expansion of `Paths.ts` into granular endpoints for various modules indicates a structured approach to API design.

## 11:49:29 AM
The recent code changes primarily focus on integrating a new "settings" feature into the frontend application, particularly impacting the analytics module, alongside general improvements in Redux state management, API interactions, and user interface components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\store\api\settings-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM):** A new RTK Query API, `settingsApi`, was introduced to manage format settings. It includes `fetchFormat` (GET) and `updateFormat` (PUT) endpoints for `/settings/format`, using Redux Toolkit Query's caching mechanisms with `Format` tag types.
*   **`src\store\fretures\setting-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:51:05 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:02:34 AM):** A Redux slice named `settingsSlice` was created to store and manage `format` data. It features a `setFormat` reducer for direct updates and an `extraReducer` that processes data from `fetchFormat.matchFulfilled` to populate the `format` state, ensuring unique key assignments. The second timestamp shows no functional changes, likely a re-save.
*   **`src\store\store.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:53:12 AM):** The main Redux store was updated to incorporate the new `settingsApi` and `settingSlice`, making their reducers and middleware available globally across the application.
*   **`src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM, 11:20:20 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:28:42 AM):** This page saw significant changes. It began importing and utilizing `settingSlice` to access format settings. The `metricsPackageHandler` now receives `settingsState.format` to apply formatting to analytics data. Subsequent updates removed console logs, introduced guard clauses (`if (!user?.userid || !mainState.selectedDashobard) return;`) for safer execution, and refined `useEffect` dependency arrays for improved performance and stability.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM):** This component was enhanced to dynamically render various chart types (Bar, Pie, Line, Stacked Bar, Gauge) based on `item.chartType` and `chartView`, significantly improving analytics visualization capabilities.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:04:34 AM):** A minor update was made to import `RootState` and explicitly type the `toolState` selector for better TypeScript type safety.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:06:11 AM):** This component underwent major enhancements for report exporting. Dedicated "Excel" and "PDF" buttons were introduced, replacing a generic menu. Functions for selecting columns for Excel export (`selectColumnsForExportExcel`, `handleExcel`) and applying format settings to displayed calculated values using `applyFormatting` were added. `ThemedModal` was integrated for column selection. The later timestamp again shows a minor type safety improvement by adding `RootState` import and typing.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:08:29 AM):** The `AnalyticsContainer` was updated to also import `settingSlice` and pass `settingsState.format` to `metricsPackageHandler` for individual report processing. New functionality was added using `useSaveMetricSizeMutation` and a `saveSize` function to persist the size (column and row span) of metric components, indicating support for customizable layouts.
*   **`src\services\ApiManager.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM):** An `analyticsExport` method was added to the `ApiManager` for handling analytics data exports. Notably, previous `getDateFormat` related code and the `UserSettingsResponse` interface were commented out, suggesting a shift in how user settings are fetched, likely to the new `settings-api.ts`.
*   **`src\services\Endpoints.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:33:07 AM):** A new `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` endpoint definition was added, supporting detailed query parameters including `columns`. Concurrently, the `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out, aligning with changes in `ApiManager.ts`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM - 10:53:12 AM:** Core integration of the new format settings API and slice into the Redux store.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM:** Initial consumption of format settings within the analytics page.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM:** Major enhancement to analytics chart rendering capabilities.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM:** Significant update to analytics report export functionality and formatting.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:28:42 AM:** Refactoring of the analytics page for robustness and performance.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM - 11:33:07 AM:** Introduction of dedicated analytics export API functionality and removal/migration of older user settings API.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query and Slices:** There's a strong pattern of using RTK Query for API data fetching and Redux slices for managing local state. This modular approach is central to handling data for new features like `settings` and existing ones like `analytics`.
*   **Analytics Module Expansion:** The analytics section (pages, components, APIs) is undergoing continuous development, with recurring changes focused on data visualization (new chart types), interactivity (resizable grids), and data export functionalities (Excel, PDF with column selection).
*   **Integration of Settings:** A new `settings` feature, specifically for "format" settings, is being consistently integrated into the analytics module, allowing users to apply custom formatting to displayed data and exports.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** Frequent addition of explicit type imports (`RootState`) and typings for Redux selectors indicates a concerted effort to improve type safety across the frontend.
*   **Performance and Robustness:** Repeated refinements to `useEffect` dependencies, the introduction of guard conditions, and removal of debugging logs highlight a focus on optimizing application performance and stability.
*   **API Specialization:** The `ApiManager` and `Endpoints` files show a trend towards more specialized API methods, such as a dedicated endpoint for analytics exports, while moving away from generic user settings endpoints (or re-implementing them via RTK Query).

## 12:46:42 PM
In the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts`, last updated on **October 27, 2025, at 12:35:46 PM**, significant changes were made to the analytics data export functionality.

This file primarily manages the `getExportData` endpoint, responsible for generating various analytics reports for export.

**Key Updates:**

*   **Enhanced Query Parameter Handling**: The controller now supports a wider range of query parameters for analytics reports, including `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`, `booking`, `reportName`, `filterBy`, `stackedExport`, `displayBy`, `month`, `startWeek`, `endWeek`, `quarter`, `group`, and `columns`. Default date ranges are applied if not explicitly provided.
*   **Dynamic Column Management**: The system dynamically fetches and saves user-selected columns using `columnsQuery` and `saveColumns` utilities, indicating personalized report views.
*   **Conditional Query Generation**: The main SQL query (`mainQuery`) is constructed conditionally based on whether the report is `booking` or `nonBooking`.
    *   For **booking reports**, it applies `DISTINCT ON` logic, either `mblno`-wise or based on `voyage`, `contno`, and container type, and integrates custom queries from `bookingQuery`.
    *   For **non-booking reports**, it leverages `nonBookingQuery` to build the custom query.
*   **Specific TEU MBL-wise Report Logic**: A new filtering mechanism was introduced for reports containing "teu" and "mbl" in their name. This logic identifies and marks duplicate `voyage`, `contno`, and `contType` combinations by setting their `teu` value to `'-'`, suggesting an attempt to de-duplicate or highlight specific entries in such reports.
*   **Data Standardization with `replaceColumnHandler`**: A new helper function, `replaceColumnHandler`, was added and integrated into both booking and non-booking export paths. This function standardizes location names by changing 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' (case-insensitive) for both `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` fields. This indicates a data cleansing or normalization requirement for consistency in report output.
*   **Utility Integration**: The controller heavily relies on external utility functions from `../../utils/analytics` for tasks like date handling, user object retrieval, and specific query constructions, promoting code reusability.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Query Construction**: The code consistently separates concerns by using dedicated functions (`bookingQuery`, `nonBookingQuery`, `columnsQuery`) to build parts of the SQL queries, improving readability and maintainability.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Each export attempt is wrapped in a `try-catch` block, logging errors and returning a `500 Internal Server Error` response, indicating a standard approach to error management.
*   **Data Transformation Post-Query**: The pattern of fetching raw data from the database and then applying additional transformations (e.g., `dateFilterOnExport`, `replaceColumnHandler`, and the TEU MBL-wise specific logic) before sending the response is evident.

## 12:49:09 PM
The changes log details a concentrated development effort on October 27, 2025, focusing on expanding the application's API endpoints, introducing a new settings management module, and significantly enhancing analytics data export capabilities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM)**: This file received a major update, defining new API paths.
    *   **Analytics:** A substantial set of new endpoints were added under `/analytics` for `Get`, `Create`, `Update`, `DeleteView` dashboards, fetching `MetricsList`, `GetExcelReport`, `SaveSequence`, `SaveSize`, and various data metrics like `Cbm`, `Kgs`, `Teu`, `Containers`, `Transit`, and `TablesData`.
    *   **Settings:** New paths were introduced under `/settings` for `Get`, `Post`, `Put` operations on `/format` settings, and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for `/grid-config`.
    *   **Company:** An empty base path for `/company` was also added.

*   **`src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM)**: This file establishes the Express.js routes for the new settings functionality.
    *   It defines GET routes for all newly introduced `Paths.Settings` endpoints (`/format` and `/grid-config`).
    *   Notably, all these routes (`Get`, `Post`, `Put` for `/format`, and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for `/grid-config`) are initially pointed to a generic `getAll` handler imported from `bookingService`, suggesting a placeholder or an initial setup that might be refined later.

*   **`src\services\setting-service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM, 11:00:20 AM, 11:01:18 AM)**: This file introduces and refines the core logic for managing settings.
    *   **11:00:09 AM**: Initial implementation of functions `getFormat`, `addFormat`, `updateFormat` (for `format_settings` table), `updateGridSettings`, and `getGridSettings` (for user-specific `grid_settings` table). `updateGridSettings` includes logic to either insert a new grid configuration or update an existing one based on `userid` and `screen`.
    *   **11:00:20 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous entry.
    *   **11:01:18 AM**: Refactored to remove unused imports (`AuthenticatedRequest`, `HttpError`) and standardize the `req` parameter type in `addFormat` to `IAuthReq`, aligning with other functions in the service.

*   **`src\utils\analytics.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM)**: This utility file saw significant expansion to support complex analytics and reporting needs.
    *   **Date Handling**: Added `defaultDateRange` to provide a 365-day period and `isValidDate` to validate date strings.
    *   **Query Utilities**: Introduced `replaceValueInQuery` for dynamic SQL column value replacement (e.g., `pod` or `place_of_delivery`). `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` was added to generate SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses based on display periods (month, week, quarter).
    *   **User Management**: `getUserObject` was enhanced to retrieve `usercode` for admin users based on `companyname`.
    *   **Excel Export**: `getExcelSelectedColumns` was implemented to dynamically select specific columns for Excel reports, with special logic for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI" reports.
    *   **Data Transformation**: `dateFilterOnExport` was added to filter out invalid dates and format valid ones for export. A comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array was defined to map internal keys to display names for various data fields.

*   **`src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM - 12:39:31 PM)**: This file introduces and iteratively refines the `getExportData` function responsible for generating analytics export data.
    *   **11:48:28 AM**: Initial implementation of `getExportData`. It dynamically constructs SQL queries based on report type (`booking` vs. non-booking), user-specific company and access, date ranges, and selected columns. It includes logic for `DISTINCT ON` clauses for MBL-wise or container-wise data, date filtering using `dateFilterOnExport`, and a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize 'LONG BEACH' values to 'LOS ANGELES' in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields. An additional filter for MBL-wise TEU reports ensures unique container entries.
    *   **11:50:55 AM - 11:57:07 AM**: Multiple minor changes were made, primarily adding `console.log` statements for debugging `req.query`, `userCode`, `mainQuery`, and `excelExportData.rows` at various stages of data processing. These do not introduce functional changes but indicate active development and debugging.
    *   **12:38:23 PM**: The `getExportData` function underwent a minor refactoring, wrapping more logic within its `try...catch` block and slightly adjusting variable declarations and `userCode` retrieval. The TEU filter logic also saw a minor, functionally equivalent, change in how `contType` is determined.
    *   **12:39:31 PM**: Appears to be a partial revert or correction of the 12:38:23 PM refactoring, restoring the explicit `Promise<Response>` return type for `getExportData` and moving some variable declarations outside the `try` block.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development:** All changes occurred on the same day (10/27/2025), indicating a dedicated work session on new features.
*   **New Modules:** Introduction of a `Settings` module with CRUD operations for format settings and user-specific grid configurations, demonstrating an effort to enhance user customization.
*   **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:** A significant focus on exporting analytics data, evidenced by new utility functions for dynamic query construction, date handling, and column selection, and the main `analyticsExportService` for orchestrating these exports.
*   **Data Normalization/Transformation:** A consistent pattern of data transformation, specifically converting 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields, is implemented in both utility functions and the export service.
*   **Database Interaction:** Regular use of `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` across services for data persistence and retrieval.
*   **Error Handling:** All service functions consistently implement `try...catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully, typically returning a 500 status code with a generic error message.
*   **Debugging/Logging:** Frequent addition of `console.log` and `logger.info` statements in `analyticsExportService.ts` across multiple timestamps suggests active debugging and logging during development.

## 12:49:38 PM
The changes primarily introduce and integrate a new "settings" feature, focusing on data formatting within the analytics section of the application, alongside general refactoring and export enhancements.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\api\settings-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM)**: A new Redux Toolkit Query API slice named `settingsApi` was created. It includes `fetchFormat` (GET) and `updateFormat` (PUT) endpoints for managing application-wide data formatting settings. This API uses `getAppHeaders()` for authorization and `API_BASE_URL`, with `Format` as a `tagType` for caching.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\fretures\setting-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:51:05 AM and 10/27/2025, 11:02:34 AM)**: A new Redux slice named `settingsSlice` was introduced to manage the `format` state. It includes a `setFormat` reducer and an `extraReducer` that populates the `format` state with data fetched from `settingsApi.endpoints.fetchFormat`. The second entry at 11:02:34 AM appears to be a re-save with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\store.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:53:12 AM)**: The central Redux store was updated to integrate the new `settingsApi` (reducer and middleware) and `settingSlice` into the application's state management.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM, 11:20:20 AM, and 11:28:42 AM)**:
    *   **11:02:14 AM**: The `AnalyticsScreen` component was significantly updated to import and use `settingsState` from the new `settingSlice`. The `metricsPackageHandler` function, responsible for processing analytics data, now receives `settingsState.format` to apply formatting. Debugging `console.log` statements were added.
    *   **11:20:20 AM**: A minor debugging `console.log` for `fetchReport` was added.
    *   **11:28:42 AM**: The `useEffect` hooks were refactored to improve dependency management and stability. Guards were added to prevent unnecessary data fetches, and `console.log` statements were removed.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM)**: This component, responsible for rendering individual metric charts, appears to have minor non-functional changes in the provided log, mainly related to imports (`ThemedModal`).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:04:34 AM)**: A `RootState` type import was added for `useSelector` for better type safety, with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM, 11:06:11 AM, and 12:41:05 PM)**:
    *   **11:05:20 AM**: The component was updated to use the new `applyFormatting` utility for displaying calculated values (`calValue`) using a `Chip`. It also introduced a `ThemedModal` for selecting columns before exporting data to Excel. The `toolState` useSelector was corrected to use `state.analyticSlice`.
    *   **11:06:11 AM**: Added `RootState` type import, otherwise functionally identical to the previous version.
    *   **12:41:05 PM**: A re-save with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:08:29 AM)**: This component now also imports `settingsState` and passes `settingsState.format` to `metricsPackageHandler` when fetching individual reports or combining initial data, ensuring consistent formatting for displayed metrics.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\services\ApiManager.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM)**: The `analyticsExport` method's `query` parameter type was adjusted. The previously existing `getDateFormat` and `UserSettingsResponse` interface were commented out, indicating a shift away from a separate user settings API.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\services\Endpoints.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:33:07 AM)**: The `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` endpoint definition was expanded to include additional query parameters such as `quarter`, `mblwise`, `booking`, `companyname`, `access`, and `columns`. The `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out, aligning with changes in `ApiManager.ts`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **New Settings Feature:** The most significant pattern is the introduction of a dedicated settings management system (`settings-api.ts`, `setting-slice.ts`) for data formatting.
*   **Analytics Integration:** This new settings feature is deeply integrated into the analytics module, with `settingsState.format` being passed to data processing functions (`metricsPackageHandler`) and used in UI components (`MetricFooter.tsx`) to display formatted values.
*   **Export Enhancements:** There's a clear effort to improve data export capabilities for analytics reports, including the introduction of column selection for Excel exports and expanded parameters for the analytics export API.
*   **Refactoring and Type Safety:** Consistent updates across several files include adding explicit `RootState` types for Redux selectors and refining `useEffect` dependencies, indicating a move towards more robust, predictable, and type-safe frontend code.
*   **API Consolidation/Deprecation:** The removal of `USER_SETTINGS` related code in `ApiManager.ts` and `Endpoints.ts` suggests that the new `settingsApi` is designed to handle or centralize user/application settings, replacing older, separate implementations.
*   **Timestamps:** Most functional changes occurred within a concentrated period between 10:50 AM and 11:33 AM on October 27, 2025, suggesting a focused development effort. Subsequent entries are mainly minor fixes or re-saves.

## 1:46:42 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts` was last modified on `10/27/2025, 12:35:46 PM`.

This file primarily manages the export of analytics data, differentiating between booking and non-booking reports. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** The `getExportData` function dynamically constructs SQL queries based on numerous request parameters defined in the `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface, such as `fromDate`, `toDate`, `reportName`, `displayBy`, `filterBy`, and `booking` status.
*   **User and Column Management:** It integrates with utility functions to retrieve user and company details (`getUserObject`), and saves selected columns for reports (`saveColumns`).
*   **Booking vs. Non-Booking Logic:** Separate query generation paths exist for booking-related exports (`bookingQuery`) and non-booking exports (`nonBookingQuery`), including distinct handling for MBL-wise reports.
*   **TEU MBLwise Report Special Handling:** A specific logic block is present for "TEU MBLwise" reports to deduplicate container entries based on `voyage`, `contno`, and `cont_type`, setting `teu` to `'-'` for duplicates.
*   **Data Post-Processing:** All exported data undergoes two consistent post-processing steps:
    1.  `dateFilterOnExport`: Filters the data based on date criteria.
    2.  `replaceColumnHandler`: Standardizes port names, specifically mapping 'LONG BEACH' (case-insensitive) to 'LOS ANGELES' for both `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` fields. An older, commented-out version of this handler suggests an evolution of this standardization logic.
*   **Error Handling:** The function includes robust `try...catch` blocks for error management, logging errors and returning a 500 status on failure.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The code consistently uses dynamic SQL generation, conditional logic based on request parameters (e.g., `isBooking`, `mblwise`), and applies a standard set of post-processing functions (`dateFilterOnExport`, `replaceColumnHandler`) to the results before sending the response. There's also a pattern of extensive logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`) throughout the function.
