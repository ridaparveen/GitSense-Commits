# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 11:49:02 AM
The changes log details significant updates across several core functionalities, primarily focusing on expanded analytics and settings management.

In `src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM), numerous new API endpoints were introduced. The `Analytics` module saw a substantial expansion with paths for dashboard management (`/dashboards`, `/create`, `/update`, `/delete-view`, `/dashboardEndPoints`), metrics (`/metricsList`), and various report exports and data points (`/excelExport`, `/save-sequence`, `/save_size`, `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, `/Tables/tableData`). The `Settings` module also gained new paths for managing formats (`/format` with GET, POST, PUT) and grid configurations (`/grid-config` with GET, POST). Other modules like `User`, `Booking`, `Reports`, `Shipment`, and `Autocom` also received new, more granular endpoints, indicating a broad feature enhancement.

The `src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts` file (10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM) was updated to define routes for settings, including `Get`, `Post`, `Put` for format settings and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for grid configurations, based on the newly defined `Paths`. However, all these routes are currently incorrectly mapped to `getAll` from the `bookingService`, indicating an incomplete implementation or a placeholder error that needs correction.

The `src\services\setting-service.ts` file underwent several updates:
- The initial version (10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM) introduced a new service with functions to `getFormat`, `addFormat`, `updateFormat` for managing `format_settings` in the database, and `updateGridSettings`, `getGridSettings` for managing user-specific grid configurations in `grid_settings`. The `updateGridSettings` function includes logic to either insert a new setting or update an existing one based on `userid` and `screen`.
- A subsequent entry (10/27/2025, 11:00:20 AM) shows no functional changes, likely a re-save.
- A final update (10/27/2025, 11:01:18 AM) refactored the `addFormat` function to consistently use `IAuthReq` for authenticated requests, aligning it with other functions in the service, and removed unused imports like `AuthenticatedRequest` and `HttpError`.

In `src\utils\analytics.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM), a comprehensive set of utility functions for analytics and reporting was added. These include:
- `defaultDateRange`: Provides a default 365-day date range.
- `replaceValueInQuery`: A function to dynamically modify SQL query clauses, specifically for normalizing location data (e.g., transforming 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES').
- `getUserObject`: Fetches extended user information based on company and access level.
- `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for time-series aggregation by month, week, or quarter.
- `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Dynamically selects database columns for Excel reports based on report name and booking status, including specific logic for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI" reports.
- `isValidDate`: A helper to validate date strings.
- `dateFilterOnExport`: Processes data rows to replace invalid date values with `null` and optionally formats valid dates to "MM/DD/YYYY".
- `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A large array defining the display names and keys for columns intended for Excel exports, covering extensive shipment and booking details.

Finally, `src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM) introduced a new service responsible for handling analytics data exports. Its `getExportData` function:
- Processes various query parameters (date ranges, report names, display types, columns).
- Utilizes `defaultDateRange`, `getUserObject`, and `dateFilterOnExport` from the `analytics` utilities.
- Dynamically constructs complex SQL queries using external `bookingQuery` and `nonBookingQuery` functions, including `DISTINCT ON` clauses for specific report types.
- Post-processes the fetched data with `dateFilterOnExport` and `replaceColumnHandler`.
- Implements specific logic for "TEU" and "MBL" reports to handle container uniqueness.
- The `replaceColumnHandler` function explicitly transforms `pod` and `place_of_delivery` values from 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' in the final dataset, reinforcing the data normalization pattern seen in `analytics.ts`.

**Key patterns and recurring elements:**
- **Extensive Analytics and Reporting:** A major theme is the development of robust analytics features, including dynamic query building, date-based filtering, and highly customizable Excel exports.
- **Settings Management:** New capabilities for user-specific and general application settings.
- **Data Normalization:** A consistent pattern of transforming 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' for location fields (`pod`, `place_of_delivery`) appears in both utility and service layers, suggesting a business requirement for unifying these locations.
- **Database Utilities:** Heavy reliance on common `query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery` database utilities across new services.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of `logger.info` and `logger.error` and standard `res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" })` for error responses across services.
- **Modular API Design:** The expansion of `Paths.ts` into granular endpoints for various modules indicates a structured approach to API design.

## 11:49:29 AM
The recent code changes primarily focus on integrating a new "settings" feature into the frontend application, particularly impacting the analytics module, alongside general improvements in Redux state management, API interactions, and user interface components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\store\api\settings-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM):** A new RTK Query API, `settingsApi`, was introduced to manage format settings. It includes `fetchFormat` (GET) and `updateFormat` (PUT) endpoints for `/settings/format`, using Redux Toolkit Query's caching mechanisms with `Format` tag types.
*   **`src\store\fretures\setting-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:51:05 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:02:34 AM):** A Redux slice named `settingsSlice` was created to store and manage `format` data. It features a `setFormat` reducer for direct updates and an `extraReducer` that processes data from `fetchFormat.matchFulfilled` to populate the `format` state, ensuring unique key assignments. The second timestamp shows no functional changes, likely a re-save.
*   **`src\store\store.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:53:12 AM):** The main Redux store was updated to incorporate the new `settingsApi` and `settingSlice`, making their reducers and middleware available globally across the application.
*   **`src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM, 11:20:20 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:28:42 AM):** This page saw significant changes. It began importing and utilizing `settingSlice` to access format settings. The `metricsPackageHandler` now receives `settingsState.format` to apply formatting to analytics data. Subsequent updates removed console logs, introduced guard clauses (`if (!user?.userid || !mainState.selectedDashobard) return;`) for safer execution, and refined `useEffect` dependency arrays for improved performance and stability.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM):** This component was enhanced to dynamically render various chart types (Bar, Pie, Line, Stacked Bar, Gauge) based on `item.chartType` and `chartView`, significantly improving analytics visualization capabilities.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:04:34 AM):** A minor update was made to import `RootState` and explicitly type the `toolState` selector for better TypeScript type safety.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:06:11 AM):** This component underwent major enhancements for report exporting. Dedicated "Excel" and "PDF" buttons were introduced, replacing a generic menu. Functions for selecting columns for Excel export (`selectColumnsForExportExcel`, `handleExcel`) and applying format settings to displayed calculated values using `applyFormatting` were added. `ThemedModal` was integrated for column selection. The later timestamp again shows a minor type safety improvement by adding `RootState` import and typing.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:08:29 AM):** The `AnalyticsContainer` was updated to also import `settingSlice` and pass `settingsState.format` to `metricsPackageHandler` for individual report processing. New functionality was added using `useSaveMetricSizeMutation` and a `saveSize` function to persist the size (column and row span) of metric components, indicating support for customizable layouts.
*   **`src\services\ApiManager.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM):** An `analyticsExport` method was added to the `ApiManager` for handling analytics data exports. Notably, previous `getDateFormat` related code and the `UserSettingsResponse` interface were commented out, suggesting a shift in how user settings are fetched, likely to the new `settings-api.ts`.
*   **`src\services\Endpoints.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:33:07 AM):** A new `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` endpoint definition was added, supporting detailed query parameters including `columns`. Concurrently, the `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out, aligning with changes in `ApiManager.ts`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM - 10:53:12 AM:** Core integration of the new format settings API and slice into the Redux store.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM:** Initial consumption of format settings within the analytics page.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM:** Major enhancement to analytics chart rendering capabilities.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM:** Significant update to analytics report export functionality and formatting.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:28:42 AM:** Refactoring of the analytics page for robustness and performance.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM - 11:33:07 AM:** Introduction of dedicated analytics export API functionality and removal/migration of older user settings API.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query and Slices:** There's a strong pattern of using RTK Query for API data fetching and Redux slices for managing local state. This modular approach is central to handling data for new features like `settings` and existing ones like `analytics`.
*   **Analytics Module Expansion:** The analytics section (pages, components, APIs) is undergoing continuous development, with recurring changes focused on data visualization (new chart types), interactivity (resizable grids), and data export functionalities (Excel, PDF with column selection).
*   **Integration of Settings:** A new `settings` feature, specifically for "format" settings, is being consistently integrated into the analytics module, allowing users to apply custom formatting to displayed data and exports.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** Frequent addition of explicit type imports (`RootState`) and typings for Redux selectors indicates a concerted effort to improve type safety across the frontend.
*   **Performance and Robustness:** Repeated refinements to `useEffect` dependencies, the introduction of guard conditions, and removal of debugging logs highlight a focus on optimizing application performance and stability.
*   **API Specialization:** The `ApiManager` and `Endpoints` files show a trend towards more specialized API methods, such as a dedicated endpoint for analytics exports, while moving away from generic user settings endpoints (or re-implementing them via RTK Query).

## 12:46:42 PM
In the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts`, last updated on **October 27, 2025, at 12:35:46 PM**, significant changes were made to the analytics data export functionality.

This file primarily manages the `getExportData` endpoint, responsible for generating various analytics reports for export.

**Key Updates:**

*   **Enhanced Query Parameter Handling**: The controller now supports a wider range of query parameters for analytics reports, including `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`, `booking`, `reportName`, `filterBy`, `stackedExport`, `displayBy`, `month`, `startWeek`, `endWeek`, `quarter`, `group`, and `columns`. Default date ranges are applied if not explicitly provided.
*   **Dynamic Column Management**: The system dynamically fetches and saves user-selected columns using `columnsQuery` and `saveColumns` utilities, indicating personalized report views.
*   **Conditional Query Generation**: The main SQL query (`mainQuery`) is constructed conditionally based on whether the report is `booking` or `nonBooking`.
    *   For **booking reports**, it applies `DISTINCT ON` logic, either `mblno`-wise or based on `voyage`, `contno`, and container type, and integrates custom queries from `bookingQuery`.
    *   For **non-booking reports**, it leverages `nonBookingQuery` to build the custom query.
*   **Specific TEU MBL-wise Report Logic**: A new filtering mechanism was introduced for reports containing "teu" and "mbl" in their name. This logic identifies and marks duplicate `voyage`, `contno`, and `contType` combinations by setting their `teu` value to `'-'`, suggesting an attempt to de-duplicate or highlight specific entries in such reports.
*   **Data Standardization with `replaceColumnHandler`**: A new helper function, `replaceColumnHandler`, was added and integrated into both booking and non-booking export paths. This function standardizes location names by changing 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' (case-insensitive) for both `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` fields. This indicates a data cleansing or normalization requirement for consistency in report output.
*   **Utility Integration**: The controller heavily relies on external utility functions from `../../utils/analytics` for tasks like date handling, user object retrieval, and specific query constructions, promoting code reusability.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Query Construction**: The code consistently separates concerns by using dedicated functions (`bookingQuery`, `nonBookingQuery`, `columnsQuery`) to build parts of the SQL queries, improving readability and maintainability.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Each export attempt is wrapped in a `try-catch` block, logging errors and returning a `500 Internal Server Error` response, indicating a standard approach to error management.
*   **Data Transformation Post-Query**: The pattern of fetching raw data from the database and then applying additional transformations (e.g., `dateFilterOnExport`, `replaceColumnHandler`, and the TEU MBL-wise specific logic) before sending the response is evident.

## 12:49:09 PM
The changes log details a concentrated development effort on October 27, 2025, focusing on expanding the application's API endpoints, introducing a new settings management module, and significantly enhancing analytics data export capabilities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM)**: This file received a major update, defining new API paths.
    *   **Analytics:** A substantial set of new endpoints were added under `/analytics` for `Get`, `Create`, `Update`, `DeleteView` dashboards, fetching `MetricsList`, `GetExcelReport`, `SaveSequence`, `SaveSize`, and various data metrics like `Cbm`, `Kgs`, `Teu`, `Containers`, `Transit`, and `TablesData`.
    *   **Settings:** New paths were introduced under `/settings` for `Get`, `Post`, `Put` operations on `/format` settings, and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for `/grid-config`.
    *   **Company:** An empty base path for `/company` was also added.

*   **`src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM)**: This file establishes the Express.js routes for the new settings functionality.
    *   It defines GET routes for all newly introduced `Paths.Settings` endpoints (`/format` and `/grid-config`).
    *   Notably, all these routes (`Get`, `Post`, `Put` for `/format`, and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for `/grid-config`) are initially pointed to a generic `getAll` handler imported from `bookingService`, suggesting a placeholder or an initial setup that might be refined later.

*   **`src\services\setting-service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM, 11:00:20 AM, 11:01:18 AM)**: This file introduces and refines the core logic for managing settings.
    *   **11:00:09 AM**: Initial implementation of functions `getFormat`, `addFormat`, `updateFormat` (for `format_settings` table), `updateGridSettings`, and `getGridSettings` (for user-specific `grid_settings` table). `updateGridSettings` includes logic to either insert a new grid configuration or update an existing one based on `userid` and `screen`.
    *   **11:00:20 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous entry.
    *   **11:01:18 AM**: Refactored to remove unused imports (`AuthenticatedRequest`, `HttpError`) and standardize the `req` parameter type in `addFormat` to `IAuthReq`, aligning with other functions in the service.

*   **`src\utils\analytics.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM)**: This utility file saw significant expansion to support complex analytics and reporting needs.
    *   **Date Handling**: Added `defaultDateRange` to provide a 365-day period and `isValidDate` to validate date strings.
    *   **Query Utilities**: Introduced `replaceValueInQuery` for dynamic SQL column value replacement (e.g., `pod` or `place_of_delivery`). `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` was added to generate SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses based on display periods (month, week, quarter).
    *   **User Management**: `getUserObject` was enhanced to retrieve `usercode` for admin users based on `companyname`.
    *   **Excel Export**: `getExcelSelectedColumns` was implemented to dynamically select specific columns for Excel reports, with special logic for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI" reports.
    *   **Data Transformation**: `dateFilterOnExport` was added to filter out invalid dates and format valid ones for export. A comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array was defined to map internal keys to display names for various data fields.

*   **`src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM - 12:39:31 PM)**: This file introduces and iteratively refines the `getExportData` function responsible for generating analytics export data.
    *   **11:48:28 AM**: Initial implementation of `getExportData`. It dynamically constructs SQL queries based on report type (`booking` vs. non-booking), user-specific company and access, date ranges, and selected columns. It includes logic for `DISTINCT ON` clauses for MBL-wise or container-wise data, date filtering using `dateFilterOnExport`, and a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize 'LONG BEACH' values to 'LOS ANGELES' in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields. An additional filter for MBL-wise TEU reports ensures unique container entries.
    *   **11:50:55 AM - 11:57:07 AM**: Multiple minor changes were made, primarily adding `console.log` statements for debugging `req.query`, `userCode`, `mainQuery`, and `excelExportData.rows` at various stages of data processing. These do not introduce functional changes but indicate active development and debugging.
    *   **12:38:23 PM**: The `getExportData` function underwent a minor refactoring, wrapping more logic within its `try...catch` block and slightly adjusting variable declarations and `userCode` retrieval. The TEU filter logic also saw a minor, functionally equivalent, change in how `contType` is determined.
    *   **12:39:31 PM**: Appears to be a partial revert or correction of the 12:38:23 PM refactoring, restoring the explicit `Promise<Response>` return type for `getExportData` and moving some variable declarations outside the `try` block.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development:** All changes occurred on the same day (10/27/2025), indicating a dedicated work session on new features.
*   **New Modules:** Introduction of a `Settings` module with CRUD operations for format settings and user-specific grid configurations, demonstrating an effort to enhance user customization.
*   **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:** A significant focus on exporting analytics data, evidenced by new utility functions for dynamic query construction, date handling, and column selection, and the main `analyticsExportService` for orchestrating these exports.
*   **Data Normalization/Transformation:** A consistent pattern of data transformation, specifically converting 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields, is implemented in both utility functions and the export service.
*   **Database Interaction:** Regular use of `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` across services for data persistence and retrieval.
*   **Error Handling:** All service functions consistently implement `try...catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully, typically returning a 500 status code with a generic error message.
*   **Debugging/Logging:** Frequent addition of `console.log` and `logger.info` statements in `analyticsExportService.ts` across multiple timestamps suggests active debugging and logging during development.

## 12:49:38 PM
The changes primarily introduce and integrate a new "settings" feature, focusing on data formatting within the analytics section of the application, alongside general refactoring and export enhancements.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\api\settings-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM)**: A new Redux Toolkit Query API slice named `settingsApi` was created. It includes `fetchFormat` (GET) and `updateFormat` (PUT) endpoints for managing application-wide data formatting settings. This API uses `getAppHeaders()` for authorization and `API_BASE_URL`, with `Format` as a `tagType` for caching.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\fretures\setting-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:51:05 AM and 10/27/2025, 11:02:34 AM)**: A new Redux slice named `settingsSlice` was introduced to manage the `format` state. It includes a `setFormat` reducer and an `extraReducer` that populates the `format` state with data fetched from `settingsApi.endpoints.fetchFormat`. The second entry at 11:02:34 AM appears to be a re-save with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\store.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:53:12 AM)**: The central Redux store was updated to integrate the new `settingsApi` (reducer and middleware) and `settingSlice` into the application's state management.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM, 11:20:20 AM, and 11:28:42 AM)**:
    *   **11:02:14 AM**: The `AnalyticsScreen` component was significantly updated to import and use `settingsState` from the new `settingSlice`. The `metricsPackageHandler` function, responsible for processing analytics data, now receives `settingsState.format` to apply formatting. Debugging `console.log` statements were added.
    *   **11:20:20 AM**: A minor debugging `console.log` for `fetchReport` was added.
    *   **11:28:42 AM**: The `useEffect` hooks were refactored to improve dependency management and stability. Guards were added to prevent unnecessary data fetches, and `console.log` statements were removed.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM)**: This component, responsible for rendering individual metric charts, appears to have minor non-functional changes in the provided log, mainly related to imports (`ThemedModal`).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:04:34 AM)**: A `RootState` type import was added for `useSelector` for better type safety, with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM, 11:06:11 AM, and 12:41:05 PM)**:
    *   **11:05:20 AM**: The component was updated to use the new `applyFormatting` utility for displaying calculated values (`calValue`) using a `Chip`. It also introduced a `ThemedModal` for selecting columns before exporting data to Excel. The `toolState` useSelector was corrected to use `state.analyticSlice`.
    *   **11:06:11 AM**: Added `RootState` type import, otherwise functionally identical to the previous version.
    *   **12:41:05 PM**: A re-save with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:08:29 AM)**: This component now also imports `settingsState` and passes `settingsState.format` to `metricsPackageHandler` when fetching individual reports or combining initial data, ensuring consistent formatting for displayed metrics.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\services\ApiManager.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM)**: The `analyticsExport` method's `query` parameter type was adjusted. The previously existing `getDateFormat` and `UserSettingsResponse` interface were commented out, indicating a shift away from a separate user settings API.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\services\Endpoints.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:33:07 AM)**: The `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` endpoint definition was expanded to include additional query parameters such as `quarter`, `mblwise`, `booking`, `companyname`, `access`, and `columns`. The `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out, aligning with changes in `ApiManager.ts`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **New Settings Feature:** The most significant pattern is the introduction of a dedicated settings management system (`settings-api.ts`, `setting-slice.ts`) for data formatting.
*   **Analytics Integration:** This new settings feature is deeply integrated into the analytics module, with `settingsState.format` being passed to data processing functions (`metricsPackageHandler`) and used in UI components (`MetricFooter.tsx`) to display formatted values.
*   **Export Enhancements:** There's a clear effort to improve data export capabilities for analytics reports, including the introduction of column selection for Excel exports and expanded parameters for the analytics export API.
*   **Refactoring and Type Safety:** Consistent updates across several files include adding explicit `RootState` types for Redux selectors and refining `useEffect` dependencies, indicating a move towards more robust, predictable, and type-safe frontend code.
*   **API Consolidation/Deprecation:** The removal of `USER_SETTINGS` related code in `ApiManager.ts` and `Endpoints.ts` suggests that the new `settingsApi` is designed to handle or centralize user/application settings, replacing older, separate implementations.
*   **Timestamps:** Most functional changes occurred within a concentrated period between 10:50 AM and 11:33 AM on October 27, 2025, suggesting a focused development effort. Subsequent entries are mainly minor fixes or re-saves.

## 1:46:42 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts` was last modified on `10/27/2025, 12:35:46 PM`.

This file primarily manages the export of analytics data, differentiating between booking and non-booking reports. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** The `getExportData` function dynamically constructs SQL queries based on numerous request parameters defined in the `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface, such as `fromDate`, `toDate`, `reportName`, `displayBy`, `filterBy`, and `booking` status.
*   **User and Column Management:** It integrates with utility functions to retrieve user and company details (`getUserObject`), and saves selected columns for reports (`saveColumns`).
*   **Booking vs. Non-Booking Logic:** Separate query generation paths exist for booking-related exports (`bookingQuery`) and non-booking exports (`nonBookingQuery`), including distinct handling for MBL-wise reports.
*   **TEU MBLwise Report Special Handling:** A specific logic block is present for "TEU MBLwise" reports to deduplicate container entries based on `voyage`, `contno`, and `cont_type`, setting `teu` to `'-'` for duplicates.
*   **Data Post-Processing:** All exported data undergoes two consistent post-processing steps:
    1.  `dateFilterOnExport`: Filters the data based on date criteria.
    2.  `replaceColumnHandler`: Standardizes port names, specifically mapping 'LONG BEACH' (case-insensitive) to 'LOS ANGELES' for both `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` fields. An older, commented-out version of this handler suggests an evolution of this standardization logic.
*   **Error Handling:** The function includes robust `try...catch` blocks for error management, logging errors and returning a 500 status on failure.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The code consistently uses dynamic SQL generation, conditional logic based on request parameters (e.g., `isBooking`, `mblwise`), and applies a standard set of post-processing functions (`dateFilterOnExport`, `replaceColumnHandler`) to the results before sending the response. There's also a pattern of extensive logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`) throughout the function.

## 1:49:09 PM
The provided log details a concentrated period of development activity on October 27, 2025, primarily focused on introducing and refining "Settings" and "Analytics Export" functionalities.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM):**
    *   This file saw a significant expansion of API endpoints.
    *   New `Analytics` routes were added for dashboard management, metrics, Excel reports, and data aggregation (CBM, KGS, TEU, Containers, Transit, TablesData).
    *   New `Settings` routes were introduced for managing format and grid configurations (Get, Post, Put, GetGrid, PostGrid).
    *   A base `Company` path was also added. This suggests the rollout of major new features related to reporting and customizable user interfaces.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM):**
    *   A new Express Router `SettingRoutes` was established.
    *   It defines routes for `Settings.Get`, `Post`, `Put`, `GetGrid`, and `PostGrid`.
    *   Interestingly, all these setting routes are currently mapped to `getAll` from `bookingService`, which might indicate a placeholder or an incorrect initial implementation, as `bookingService` is unlikely to contain setting logic.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\setting-service.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM, 11:00:20 AM, 11:01:18 AM):**
    *   This file was introduced to handle format and grid settings.
    *   **Initial version (11:00:09 AM):** Implemented `getFormat`, `addFormat`, `updateFormat` to manage general format settings in a `format_settings` table, and `updateGridSettings`, `getGridSettings` to manage user-specific grid configurations in a `grid_settings` table, with logic for inserting new settings or updating existing ones.
    *   **Subsequent updates (11:00:20 AM & 11:01:18 AM):** Primarily involved minor refactoring and cleanup. The 11:01:18 AM update removed unused imports (`AuthenticatedRequest`, `HttpError`) and standardized the request type for `addFormat` to `IAuthReq`. The 11:00:20 AM entry appears to be an identical save with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM):**
    *   This new utility file provides helper functions crucial for analytics and reporting.
    *   Key functions include:
        *   `defaultDateRange`: Calculates a default date range (current date minus 365 days).
        *   `replaceValueInQuery`: A flexible function to replace column values based on conditions, specifically noted for standardizing 'pod' and 'place_of_delivery' values.
        *   `getUserObject`: Retrieves user and company details, potentially adjusting `usercode` for ADMIN access.
        *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates dynamic SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for time-based aggregation (month, week, quarter).
        *   `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Dynamically selects columns for Excel reports based on report name and booking status.
        *   `dateFilterOnExport`: Validates and formats date fields within data items for export.
        *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: An array mapping internal keys to display names for Excel export columns.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM to 12:39:31 PM):**
    *   This service was introduced and rapidly iterated upon, serving as the main entry point for exporting analytics data.
    *   **Core functionality:** The `getExportData` function handles various query parameters (date range, report name, booking status, display options, columns).
    *   It utilizes functions from `src/utils/analytics` (e.g., `defaultDateRange`, `getUserObject`, `dateFilterOnExport`).
    *   It dynamically constructs SQL queries (`mainQuery`, `mblWiseQuery`) based on report type and filters, distinguishing between booking and non-booking reports.
    *   Includes a `replaceColumnHandler` function that standardizes "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields, mirroring the `replaceValueInQuery` utility.
    *   Features an "additional MBLwise TEU filter" for specific reports to de-duplicate container data.
    *   **Iteration patterns:** Multiple timestamps show very minor changes, often just adding or moving `console.log` debugging statements, indicating active testing and fine-tuning during this short development window. One specific change (12:38:23 PM) moved the `try...catch` block, which was then largely reverted (12:39:31 PM), suggesting quick experimentation with error handling scope.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development Block:** All changes occurred on the same day within a few hours, pointing to a dedicated effort on a related set of features.
*   **New Feature Introduction:** The log clearly illustrates the introduction of a comprehensive "Settings" and "Analytics Export" module, from defining API routes to implementing backend services and utility functions.
*   **Data Standardization:** A recurring pattern is the explicit handling of data standardization, specifically converting "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for port/delivery locations across utility and service files. This suggests a business requirement for consistent location data.
*   **Dynamic Query Construction:** Both the `analytics.ts` utilities and the `analyticsExportService.ts` extensively use dynamic SQL query generation based on various input parameters (report type, display options, user-specific filters).
*   **Debugging during Development:** The frequent, minor updates to `analyticsExportService.ts` primarily involving `console.log` statements are a strong indicator of active debugging and incremental development of complex logic.
*   **User-Specific Configuration:** The `setting-service.ts` allows for storing and retrieving grid configurations tailored to individual users and screens, emphasizing personalization.
*   **Database Interaction:** Both `setting-service.ts` and `analyticsExportService.ts` make extensive use of database `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` operations.

## 1:49:53 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing the analytics module and integrating a new settings management system within the T360-V2 frontend. All significant updates occurred on October 27, 2025.

It now includes extensive TypeScript typings for analytics data structures. The `metricsPackageHandler` function was typed and updated to incorporate `formatSettings`. The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function was enhanced to use `ExcelJS` for generating complex, formatted Excel reports based on different chart types and time filters. A `reportFormula` function was introduced.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 1:38:37 PM, 1:42:50 PM, 1:43:18 PM & 1:44:49 PM):** This component enables users to create, update, and delete custom analytics dashboards. It fetches available dashboard options, allows selection of up to 9 metrics, and handles saving and deletion. UI button implementations (`Button` vs. `MdOutlineRadioButtonChecked` icons) were in flux across these changes.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 1:40:50 PM):** A new UI component `TreeViewContainer` was added, using `@mui/x-tree-view` to display metric options in a hierarchical manner with checkboxes for selection within `ViewContainer`.
*   **`src\store\fretures\analytics-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 1:46:16 PM):** The `analyticsSlice` was substantially expanded with new state properties and reducers to support global/local date filtering, dashboard selection, customer filtering, metric reordering/resizing, and selected column management for exports.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Redux Toolkit Integration:** A consistent pattern of defining RTK Query API slices and Redux slices, integrating them into the global store, and consuming them throughout the application, particularly within the analytics section.
2.  **Analytics Feature Enhancement:** The vast majority of changes are centered around enriching the analytics dashboard, including dynamic metric display, advanced filtering, custom view creation, and robust data export functionalities (Excel and PDF).
3.  **Type Safety (TypeScript):** Frequent addition of explicit type definitions (`interface`, `type RootState`) across various files (e.g., `analytics-page.tsx`, `methods.ts`, `MetricFooter.tsx`, `MetricToolbar.tsx`, `analyticsContainer.tsx`) indicates a strong emphasis on maintaining type safety.
4.  **Date and Time Handling:** `moment.js` and a `dateFilterHandle` utility are consistently used for managing date ranges and formatting in analytics features.
5.  **Data Export Functionality:** The implementation of both PDF (using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`) and Excel (using `ExcelJS`) export capabilities is a significant, recurring theme, with detailed logic for report generation.
6.  **Custom View Management:** New UI components and Redux state were developed to allow users to personalize their analytics dashboards by creating, managing, and arranging custom sets of metrics.
7.  **`settingsState.format` Integration:** A crucial pattern is the integration of `settingsState.format` from the new settings slice into the `metricsPackageHandler` and `MetricFooter` to ensure that analytics data is displayed with user-defined formatting.
8.  **UI Component Refinements:** There's an iterative process of incorporating and adjusting custom UI components, particularly evident in the `ViewContainer.tsx` changes related to buttons and icons.
9.  **Focused Development:** All changes occurred on the same date within a few hours, suggesting a dedicated development sprint or task batch focused on these intertwined features.

## 2:46:45 PM
The `core.export.controller.ts` file, last modified on 10/27/2025, 12:35:46 PM, outlines a robust system for exporting analytics data. The primary function, `getExportData`, handles requests for various reports, supporting a wide array of query parameters for dynamic data filtering and presentation, including date ranges, MBL-wise grouping, display formats, report names, and column selections.

Key updates and functionalities observed are:

*   **Comprehensive Query Parameters:** The `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface defines an extensive set of parameters, allowing for highly customized reports based on `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`, `viewBy`, `type`, `displayBy`, `booking`, `reportName`, `filterBy`, `stackedExport`, `month`, `startWeek`, `endWeek`, `quarter`, `group`, and `columns`.
*   **Column Saving Mechanism:** A new `saveColumns` utility function is introduced, indicating the ability to persist user-defined column selections for specific reports, enhancing report customization.
*   **Dynamic Booking/Non-Booking Queries:** The logic clearly differentiates between "booking" and "non-booking" reports, generating distinct SQL queries accordingly. The "booking" query includes sophisticated `DISTINCT ON` logic for handling container types (`t49_cont_type` vs `cont_type`).
*   **Specialized TEU MBLwise Report Handling:** A specific post-processing step is implemented for reports containing "teu" and "mbl" in their name. This logic identifies and modifies duplicate entries based on `voyage`, `contno`, and `contType`, setting `teu` values to `'-'` for non-unique combinations.
*   **Expanded Data Transformation (`replaceColumnHandler`):** The `replaceColumnHandler` utility now applies a data normalization rule to two distinct fields. It checks both `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` fields (case-insensitively) and replaces 'LONG BEACH' with 'LOS ANGELES' if found in either, indicating an important data standardization effort.
*   **Logging and Error Handling:** The controller incorporates `logger.info` calls for tracking columns and column-saving operations, along with standard `try...catch` blocks for robust error management.

The overall pattern is one of a flexible analytics export system, capable of handling complex business logic, user-specific customizations, and data normalization routines, all driven by a rich set of request parameters.

## 3:46:46 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts` was updated on **October 27, 2025, at 12:35:46 PM**.

This file defines an analytics controller primarily responsible for exporting data based on a wide array of user-defined parameters.

Key updates and patterns observed:

*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** The `getExportData` function constructs complex SQL queries dynamically based on numerous request parameters like `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`, `booking` (boolean flag), `reportName`, `filterBy`, `displayBy`, `month`, `startWeek`, `endWeek`, `quarter`, `group`, and `columns`. This allows for highly customizable data exports.
*   **Conditional Logic for Booking vs. Non-Booking Data:** The core logic branches significantly based on the `booking` parameter.
    *   For booking reports (`isBooking = true`), the query incorporates `mblWiseQuery` (to select distinct master bill of lading or unique container movements) and uses `bookingQuery` for specific report logic.
    *   For non-booking reports (`isBooking = false`), `nonBookingQuery` is used.
*   **User and Company Context:** The controller uses `getUserObject` to retrieve `CompanyName` and `usercode`, suggesting that data access and potentially report configurations are tailored to the authenticated user and their company.
*   **Column Management:** Functions like `columnsQuery` and `saveColumns` indicate that users can dynamically select and save preferred columns for their reports.
*   **Data Transformation and Cleansing:**
    *   `dateFilterOnExport` is applied to filter the retrieved data.
    *   A `replaceColumnHandler` function standardizes the port name "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for both `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` fields, demonstrating a data cleansing/mapping step.
*   **Special Report Handling:** A specific logic block exists for "TEU MBLwise" reports, where it identifies and marks duplicate TEU entries (based on voyage, container number, and container type) with `'-'` to ensure unique TEU counts.
*   **Default Date Range:** If `fromDate` or `toDate` are not provided, a `defaultDateRange` is applied.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The function includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during data retrieval and processing, returning a 500 status in case of an internal server error.
*   **Logging:** `logger.info` is used extensively for debugging and tracking various stages of query construction and data processing.

## 3:49:14 PM
The provided log details a series of significant code changes, primarily focusing on enhancing analytics capabilities, refining application settings, and introducing a new audit logging system. All modifications occurred on 10/27/2025, clustered into distinct development phases throughout the day.

**Key Information by File:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM (initial structure), 1:50:28 PM, 1:50:44 PM, 1:51:04 PM (analytics path refinement), 2:53:56 PM (audit path addition).
    *   **Updates:** The file initially defined various API endpoint paths. Later, the `Analytics` paths for `Create`, `Update`, and `DeleteView` were standardized to `/dashboards`. A new `Audit` base path with a `/audit` endpoint was introduced in the afternoon.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This route file was configured to handle `Settings` related requests (GET, POST, PUT for `/format` and GET, POST for `/grid-config`). It notably imported `getAll` from `bookingService` and used it for all setting routes, which might indicate a placeholder or an incorrect dependency assignment.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\setting-service.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM, 11:00:20 AM, 11:01:18 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This service manages `format_settings` (get, add, update) and user-specific `grid_settings` (update, get). Initial commits defined these functionalities including database interactions. A subsequent change (11:01:18 AM) refined the code by removing unused imports (`AuthenticatedRequest`, `HttpError`) and standardizing the request object type to `IAuthReq` for consistency.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM.
    *   **Updates:** A significant addition of utility functions to support analytics features. This includes:
        *   `defaultDateRange`: Provides a default date range (current day to 365 days prior).
        *   `replaceValueInQuery`: A function to conditionally replace column values (e.g., `pod`, `place_of_delivery`).
        *   `getUserObject`: Retrieves user information, including `usercode` based on company and access level.
        *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates dynamic SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for various display intervals (month, week, quarter).
        *   `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Selects specific columns for Excel reports based on the report name and whether it's a booking report.
        *   `isValidDate`, `dateFilterOnExport`: Utilities for validating and formatting date values within exported data.
        *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A constant array defining the structure and names of columns for Excel exports.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM, and several subsequent saves until 12:39:31 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This service implements the `getExportData` function, responsible for generating and exporting analytics data.
        *   It handles query parameters, applies default date ranges, retrieves user and company context, and dynamically constructs main SQL queries for both booking and non-booking reports using various helper functions.
        *   It includes logic to save selected columns, perform date filtering and formatting on the exported data (`dateFilterOnExport`), and transform specific location names (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" via `replaceColumnHandler`).
        *   Special handling for "MBLwise TEU" reports is included to aggregate container data.
        *   Numerous `console.log` statements were added across multiple commits, indicating active debugging during its development. Minor refactorings of the `getExportData` function signature and internal variable declarations were also made.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\index.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 2:54:23 PM, 2:57:08 PM.
    *   **Updates:** The main API router was updated to integrate new features. The `Analytics` routes were fully connected. A new `Paths.Audit.Get` route was added; initially, it was mistakenly linked to `getAllCompanyDetails`, but was quickly corrected in a subsequent commit to `getAllAudit` from the new audit service.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\common\types\audit.type.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 2:56:11 PM.
    *   **Updates:** A new enum `AuditQueryType` was defined to categorize various types of audit logs (e.g., `USER`, `EXPANSE_CODE`, `ANALYTICS_VIEW`, `ISF`, `TRACKING_FCL`), standardizing the input for the audit service.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\auditService.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 2:55:41 PM, 2:56:27 PM, 2:57:00 PM.
    *   **Updates:** A new `auditService` was introduced, with a primary function `getAllAudit` (initially `getAll`). This function retrieves audit logs based on a specified `type` and `serial_id`. It uses the `AuditQueryType` enum to determine the correct audit table and reference column. It includes specific logic for `ANALYTICS_VIEW` to fetch metric names associated with changes. The final commit refactored `getAllAudit` to be directly exported.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature-driven Development:** The changes are organized around distinct features: application settings, comprehensive analytics export, and a new audit logging system.
*   **API Endpoint Expansion:** The `Paths.ts` file shows consistent expansion of available API endpoints, particularly for `/analytics` and the introduction of `/audit`.
*   **Database Interaction:** Most new or updated services (`setting-service`, `analytics.ts`, `analyticsExportService.ts`, `auditService.ts`) involve direct interaction with a PostgreSQL database using `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions.
*   **Standardization and Refactoring:** There's a pattern of standardizing interfaces (e.g., `IAuthReq` in `setting-service.ts`) and introducing enums (`AuditQueryType`) to improve code clarity and maintainability.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent use of `logger.info` and `console.log` statements in services like `analyticsExportService.ts` indicates an active development and debugging process.
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Logic for transforming and cleaning data, such as date formatting and port name normalization, is evident in the analytics-related services.

## 3:50:17 PM
The code change log primarily focuses on the development and refinement of an Analytics dashboard within the `t360-frontend-v2` project, with significant updates to Redux state management, API interactions, and UI components, including the introduction of auditing capabilities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\store\api\settings-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM):** A new Redux Toolkit Query API slice, `settingsApi`, was introduced to manage format settings, providing `fetchFormat` (GET) and `updateFormat` (PUT) endpoints. This API uses `getAppHeaders()` for authorization and implements RTK Query's cache invalidation with `tagTypes: ["Format"]`.
*   **`src\store\fretures\setting-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:51:05 AM & 11:02:34 AM):** A `settingsSlice` Redux slice was created to hold format-related UI state. It includes a `setFormat` reducer and `extraReducers` to process data from `settingsApi.endpoints.fetchFormat`, assigning format settings based on a unique key, ensuring each key is assigned only once. The 11:02:34 AM entry appears to be a re-save without functional changes.
*   **`src\store\store.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:53:12 AM, 2:51:27 PM & 2:52:39 PM):** The main Redux store was updated to integrate `settingsApi` and `settingSlice`. Later, a new `auditDataApi` was imported and integrated, correctly adding its reducer and middleware to the store, after an initial incorrect double-inclusion of `settingsApi.reducerPath`.
*   **`src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM, 11:20:20 AM & 11:28:42 AM):** The Analytics screen was significantly updated to utilize format settings from `settingsState.format` when processing metrics via `metricsPackageHandler`. It introduced helper types and refined `useEffect` hooks for better dependency management and safer fetching of dashboard data and reports. Several debugging `console.log` statements were added and subsequently removed.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM, 3:36:30 PM, 3:37:52 PM & 3:38:35 PM):** This component gained more sophisticated chart rendering logic, dynamically setting the initial `chartView` based on the metric's `chartType`. It integrates `MetricToolbar` and `MetricFooter` and introduced `ThemedModal` for full-screen chart views. Later, extensive TypeScript type definitions were added for props and internal states, significantly improving type safety. A debugging `console.log` was temporarily added.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:04:34 AM, 3:27:00 PM, 3:28:25 PM, 3:04:20 PM, 3:07:53 PM & 3:09:46 PM):** This toolbar component was enhanced with local date, period, and view filters. It utilizes Redux actions (`setDateFilter`, `setPeriodFilter`, `setViewFilter`) to manage filter states and triggers `fetchSingleReport` on filter changes. Later updates uncommented and integrated `SelectBoxLight` components for these filters and refined TypeScript types for event handlers. A temporary label change from "Filter" to "Filter1" for the global filter was made.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM, 11:06:11 AM & 12:41:05 PM):** This component gained PDF and Excel export functionalities. It integrates `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for PDF generation (including a company logo), and `ColumnsSelector` for Excel export. It displays calculated values (`calType`, `calValue`) and report formulas using Material UI `Chip` and `Tooltip`. Type definitions for `toolState` were also added. The 11:06:11 AM and 12:41:05 PM entries are mostly type alignment or re-saves.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:08:29 AM, 3:13:28 PM, 3:13:47 PM & 3:14:00 PM):** This component was introduced to manage the layout of analytics metrics. It uses `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop (`DndProvider`, `HTML5Backend`) and `ResizableGridItem` for resizing. Mutations (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`) were added to persist layout changes. It also includes `fetchSingleReport` to update individual metrics. A temporary `<h2>kkkkk</h2>` element was added for debugging and then removed.
*   **`src\services\ApiManager.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM):** A new `analyticsExport` method was added to handle API calls for exporting analytics data. Old `UserSettingsResponse` and `getDateFormat` methods were commented out.
*   **`src\services\Endpoints.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:33:07 AM):** The `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` endpoint was defined, including various query parameters for comprehensive data export. The `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 1:37:08 PM):** Significant enhancements for dashboard management were introduced, including global PDF export (with logo), `SelectCustomerPanel`, `ChipsTabView` for dashboard selection, `SwitchBox` for `operationType` (move/resize), `SwitchTab` for `filterType` (local/global), and `AppDrawer` with `ViewContainer` for creating/managing custom views.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx` (multiple timestamps from 1:38:37 PM to 1:58:49 PM, then 2:48:11 PM, 2:49:11 PM):** This component manages the creation, saving, updating, and deletion of custom analytics views. It features metric selection via `TreeViewContianer`, input for view names, and toast notifications. Initially, buttons were temporarily mapped to `MdOutlineRadioButtonChecked` icons and then progressively replaced with a custom `Button` component. It was later integrated with `AuditViewDrawer` and `PopupAlert` for audit log display and deletion confirmations. A debugging label "Audit1" was temporarily used.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 1:40:50 PM):** This component provides a hierarchical tree view for selecting metrics for custom dashboards, using `@mui/x-tree-view` and `Checkbox` components. Type interfaces were added for structure.
*   **`src\store\fretures\analytics-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 1:46:16 PM):** This slice received extensive updates, adding `periodFilter`, `viewBy`, `refetchAll` to its state. New reducers `setPeriodFilter`, `setViewFilter`, `setRefetchAll`, `setCustomer`, and `setSelectedColumns` were implemented. Logic for `setFilterType` and `setGlobalFilter` was enhanced to synchronize global and local date filters, and `setDashboard` was improved to handle different default view representations.
*   **`src\data\coulmns\audit-view-coulmns.tsx` (10/27/2025, 2:48:02 PM):** A new file defining `ANALYTICS_VIEW_AUDIT_COLUMNS` for displaying audit logs, utilizing `RenderValuePopover` for previous and new values.
*   **`src\components\common\popupAlert.tsx` (10/27/2025, 2:48:57 PM):** A new reusable `PopupAlert` component was created using Material UI for generic confirmation/information dialogs.
*   **`src\store\api\audit-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 2:50:49 PM):** A new RTK Query API slice `auditDataApi` was created for fetching audit logs, including cache management for `Audit` tag.
*   **`src\components\common\audit-view-drawer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 2:51:04 PM):** A new `AuditViewDrawer` component was implemented to display audit logs in a Material UI drawer, using `useFetchAuditQuery` and a `DataGrid` with search functionality.
*   **`src\data\options\global.ts` (10/27/2025, 3:26:14 PM):** This file was extended to include `PERIOD_FILTER_OPTIONS` and `VIEW_BY_FILTER_OPTIONS`, centralizing configuration for analytics filters.
*   **`src\components\common\select-box.tsx` (multiple timestamps from 3:28:12 PM to 3:31:52 PM):** This file was updated to define and refine `SelectBox` and `SelectBoxLight` components. `SelectBoxLight` specifically gained a Material UI-based implementation with dynamic label behavior and received extensive TypeScript typing for improved type safety and consistency.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Redux Toolkit (RTK) Focus:** A strong pattern of utilizing Redux Toolkit, particularly RTK Query, for robust data fetching and state management. New API slices (`settings-api`, `audit-api`) and corresponding Redux slices (`setting-slice`, `analytics-slice`) are consistently integrated into the main `store.ts`.
2.  **Analytics Dashboard Enhancement:** The most prominent theme is the continuous development and improvement of the analytics dashboard, covering data display, interactive filtering (global/local, date, period, view-by), layout management (drag-and-drop, resize), custom view creation/management, and export capabilities (PDF/Excel).
3.  **TypeScript Adoption:** There's a clear and widespread effort to introduce and refine TypeScript interfaces and types across various components, hooks, and Redux slices. This aims to enhance code quality, readability, and maintainability by catching type-related errors early.
4.  **Component-Based Architecture:** The project shows a strong adherence to a component-based architecture, with specialized components for charts (`MetricsBox`), toolbars (`MetricToolbar`), footers (`MetricFooter`), custom view management (`ViewContainer`, `TreeViewContianer`), and common UI elements (`SelectBox`, `PopupAlert`, `AuditViewDrawer`).
5.  **Debugging and Iteration:** The presence of temporary `console.log` statements, UI elements (e.g., `<h2>kkkkk</h2>`), and iterative changes to button implementations (e.g., `MdOutlineRadioButtonChecked` to custom `Button` components) indicates an active development cycle with frequent testing and refinements.
6.  **Centralized Configuration and Utilities:** Utility files like `data/options/global.ts` are used to centralize common options and configurations, and `utils/utils.ts` (implied by `dateFilterHandle`) are leveraged for common helper functions.
