# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 11:49:02 AM
The changes log details significant updates across several core functionalities, primarily focusing on expanded analytics and settings management.

In `src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:56:34 AM), numerous new API endpoints were introduced. The `Analytics` module saw a substantial expansion with paths for dashboard management (`/dashboards`, `/create`, `/update`, `/delete-view`, `/dashboardEndPoints`), metrics (`/metricsList`), and various report exports and data points (`/excelExport`, `/save-sequence`, `/save_size`, `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, `/Tables/tableData`). The `Settings` module also gained new paths for managing formats (`/format` with GET, POST, PUT) and grid configurations (`/grid-config` with GET, POST). Other modules like `User`, `Booking`, `Reports`, `Shipment`, and `Autocom` also received new, more granular endpoints, indicating a broad feature enhancement.

The `src\routes\SettingRoutes.ts` file (10/27/2025, 10:58:29 AM) was updated to define routes for settings, including `Get`, `Post`, `Put` for format settings and `GetGrid`, `PostGrid` for grid configurations, based on the newly defined `Paths`. However, all these routes are currently incorrectly mapped to `getAll` from the `bookingService`, indicating an incomplete implementation or a placeholder error that needs correction.

The `src\services\setting-service.ts` file underwent several updates:
- The initial version (10/27/2025, 11:00:09 AM) introduced a new service with functions to `getFormat`, `addFormat`, `updateFormat` for managing `format_settings` in the database, and `updateGridSettings`, `getGridSettings` for managing user-specific grid configurations in `grid_settings`. The `updateGridSettings` function includes logic to either insert a new setting or update an existing one based on `userid` and `screen`.
- A subsequent entry (10/27/2025, 11:00:20 AM) shows no functional changes, likely a re-save.
- A final update (10/27/2025, 11:01:18 AM) refactored the `addFormat` function to consistently use `IAuthReq` for authenticated requests, aligning it with other functions in the service, and removed unused imports like `AuthenticatedRequest` and `HttpError`.

In `src\utils\analytics.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:47:35 AM), a comprehensive set of utility functions for analytics and reporting was added. These include:
- `defaultDateRange`: Provides a default 365-day date range.
- `replaceValueInQuery`: A function to dynamically modify SQL query clauses, specifically for normalizing location data (e.g., transforming 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES').
- `getUserObject`: Fetches extended user information based on company and access level.
- `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for time-series aggregation by month, week, or quarter.
- `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Dynamically selects database columns for Excel reports based on report name and booking status, including specific logic for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI" reports.
- `isValidDate`: A helper to validate date strings.
- `dateFilterOnExport`: Processes data rows to replace invalid date values with `null` and optionally formats valid dates to "MM/DD/YYYY".
- `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A large array defining the display names and keys for columns intended for Excel exports, covering extensive shipment and booking details.

Finally, `src\services\analyticsExportService.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:48:28 AM) introduced a new service responsible for handling analytics data exports. Its `getExportData` function:
- Processes various query parameters (date ranges, report names, display types, columns).
- Utilizes `defaultDateRange`, `getUserObject`, and `dateFilterOnExport` from the `analytics` utilities.
- Dynamically constructs complex SQL queries using external `bookingQuery` and `nonBookingQuery` functions, including `DISTINCT ON` clauses for specific report types.
- Post-processes the fetched data with `dateFilterOnExport` and `replaceColumnHandler`.
- Implements specific logic for "TEU" and "MBL" reports to handle container uniqueness.
- The `replaceColumnHandler` function explicitly transforms `pod` and `place_of_delivery` values from 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' in the final dataset, reinforcing the data normalization pattern seen in `analytics.ts`.

**Key patterns and recurring elements:**
- **Extensive Analytics and Reporting:** A major theme is the development of robust analytics features, including dynamic query building, date-based filtering, and highly customizable Excel exports.
- **Settings Management:** New capabilities for user-specific and general application settings.
- **Data Normalization:** A consistent pattern of transforming 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' for location fields (`pod`, `place_of_delivery`) appears in both utility and service layers, suggesting a business requirement for unifying these locations.
- **Database Utilities:** Heavy reliance on common `query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery` database utilities across new services.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of `logger.info` and `logger.error` and standard `res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" })` for error responses across services.
- **Modular API Design:** The expansion of `Paths.ts` into granular endpoints for various modules indicates a structured approach to API design.

## 11:49:29 AM
The recent code changes primarily focus on integrating a new "settings" feature into the frontend application, particularly impacting the analytics module, alongside general improvements in Redux state management, API interactions, and user interface components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\store\api\settings-api.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM):** A new RTK Query API, `settingsApi`, was introduced to manage format settings. It includes `fetchFormat` (GET) and `updateFormat` (PUT) endpoints for `/settings/format`, using Redux Toolkit Query's caching mechanisms with `Format` tag types.
*   **`src\store\fretures\setting-slice.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:51:05 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:02:34 AM):** A Redux slice named `settingsSlice` was created to store and manage `format` data. It features a `setFormat` reducer for direct updates and an `extraReducer` that processes data from `fetchFormat.matchFulfilled` to populate the `format` state, ensuring unique key assignments. The second timestamp shows no functional changes, likely a re-save.
*   **`src\store\store.ts` (10/27/2025, 10:53:12 AM):** The main Redux store was updated to incorporate the new `settingsApi` and `settingSlice`, making their reducers and middleware available globally across the application.
*   **`src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM, 11:20:20 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:28:42 AM):** This page saw significant changes. It began importing and utilizing `settingSlice` to access format settings. The `metricsPackageHandler` now receives `settingsState.format` to apply formatting to analytics data. Subsequent updates removed console logs, introduced guard clauses (`if (!user?.userid || !mainState.selectedDashobard) return;`) for safer execution, and refined `useEffect` dependency arrays for improved performance and stability.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM):** This component was enhanced to dynamically render various chart types (Bar, Pie, Line, Stacked Bar, Gauge) based on `item.chartType` and `chartView`, significantly improving analytics visualization capabilities.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:04:34 AM):** A minor update was made to import `RootState` and explicitly type the `toolState` selector for better TypeScript type safety.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM & 10/27/2025, 11:06:11 AM):** This component underwent major enhancements for report exporting. Dedicated "Excel" and "PDF" buttons were introduced, replacing a generic menu. Functions for selecting columns for Excel export (`selectColumnsForExportExcel`, `handleExcel`) and applying format settings to displayed calculated values using `applyFormatting` were added. `ThemedModal` was integrated for column selection. The later timestamp again shows a minor type safety improvement by adding `RootState` import and typing.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (10/27/2025, 11:08:29 AM):** The `AnalyticsContainer` was updated to also import `settingSlice` and pass `settingsState.format` to `metricsPackageHandler` for individual report processing. New functionality was added using `useSaveMetricSizeMutation` and a `saveSize` function to persist the size (column and row span) of metric components, indicating support for customizable layouts.
*   **`src\services\ApiManager.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM):** An `analyticsExport` method was added to the `ApiManager` for handling analytics data exports. Notably, previous `getDateFormat` related code and the `UserSettingsResponse` interface were commented out, suggesting a shift in how user settings are fetched, likely to the new `settings-api.ts`.
*   **`src\services\Endpoints.ts` (10/27/2025, 11:33:07 AM):** A new `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` endpoint definition was added, supporting detailed query parameters including `columns`. Concurrently, the `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out, aligning with changes in `ApiManager.ts`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 10:50:50 AM - 10:53:12 AM:** Core integration of the new format settings API and slice into the Redux store.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:02:14 AM:** Initial consumption of format settings within the analytics page.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:03:51 AM:** Major enhancement to analytics chart rendering capabilities.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:05:20 AM:** Significant update to analytics report export functionality and formatting.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:28:42 AM:** Refactoring of the analytics page for robustness and performance.
*   **10/27/2025, 11:32:07 AM - 11:33:07 AM:** Introduction of dedicated analytics export API functionality and removal/migration of older user settings API.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query and Slices:** There's a strong pattern of using RTK Query for API data fetching and Redux slices for managing local state. This modular approach is central to handling data for new features like `settings` and existing ones like `analytics`.
*   **Analytics Module Expansion:** The analytics section (pages, components, APIs) is undergoing continuous development, with recurring changes focused on data visualization (new chart types), interactivity (resizable grids), and data export functionalities (Excel, PDF with column selection).
*   **Integration of Settings:** A new `settings` feature, specifically for "format" settings, is being consistently integrated into the analytics module, allowing users to apply custom formatting to displayed data and exports.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** Frequent addition of explicit type imports (`RootState`) and typings for Redux selectors indicates a concerted effort to improve type safety across the frontend.
*   **Performance and Robustness:** Repeated refinements to `useEffect` dependencies, the introduction of guard conditions, and removal of debugging logs highlight a focus on optimizing application performance and stability.
*   **API Specialization:** The `ApiManager` and `Endpoints` files show a trend towards more specialized API methods, such as a dedicated endpoint for analytics exports, while moving away from generic user settings endpoints (or re-implementing them via RTK Query).
