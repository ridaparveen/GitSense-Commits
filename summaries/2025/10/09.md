# Activity Summary for 10/9/2025

## 10:38:30 AM
The log details changes across two primary files: `customerService.ts` and `auditModules.ts`, both within the `envosys-backend` project. The changes primarily revolve around customer management functionalities and a refined auditing mechanism.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**1. `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`**
*   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 10/9/2025, 10:06:18 AM to 10/9/2025, 10:37:55 AM.
*   **Key Updates:** The code content remains consistently identical across all provided log entries for this file, suggesting a stable version during this period or that the provided snippets do not capture the minor differences if any.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   **`getAll`:** An asynchronous function to retrieve all customer records with extensive filtering (by page, perPage, status, date range, customer ID, type, location, name) and sorting capabilities using a `QueryBuilder`. It also fetches distinct options for status, location, and customer type for UI dropdowns.
    *   **`getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`:** Fetches aggregated customer statistics (active, inactive, total) with filtering options for date ranges (weekly, monthly, all).
    *   **`saveCustomerDetails`:** Handles the initial saving of customer core details, generating a unique `customer_id`. It utilizes database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.
    *   **`CreateCustomer`:** A comprehensive function for creating a customer, including nested data.
        *   It updates the customer's status if provided.
        *   It processes `gstLocations` and `uploadDocuments`, converting them from stringified JSON if necessary.
        *   For each GST location, it performs multiple insertions into related tables (`customer_gst_location`, `customer_key_personal`, `customer_alerts`, and likely `customer_credit_control` though the snippet is truncated).
        *   Crucially, it integrates `simpleAudit` calls after the creation of each sub-entity (GST location, key personal, alerts), indicating a strong emphasis on detailed activity logging.
        *   This function also uses database transactions.
*   **Dependencies:** Imports various utilities for database interaction, HTTP status codes, customer-specific types, common helpers, logging, error handling, query building, date formatting (`moment`), file uploads (`saveDoc`), and auditing (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`).

**2. `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\modules\auditModules.ts`**
*   **Timestamp:** 10/9/2025, 10:35:19 AM.
*   **Key Updates:** This file defines the core auditing logic.
*   **`insertAudit`:** A flexible auditing function designed to track changes between new and old data states for a given table.
    *   It uses `auditConfigObj` for configuration.
    *   It supports auditing single or multiple records (normalizes input to an array).
    *   It fetches existing data to compare with new data, handling date column formatting for consistent comparison.
    *   It uses `preparePayload` to identify differences and then inserts these differences as audit logs using `insertMany`.
    *   A significant portion of the function is commented out, suggesting a refactoring or an alternative approach that was explored and then replaced with the current implementation.
*   **`simpleAudit`:** A lightweight audit function for logging simple messages directly into an audit table. It's used in `customerService.ts` for tracking specific events like "GST location created".
*   **Helper Functions:**
    *   **`preparePayload`:** Compares a single `newValue` and `oldValue` to identify differences, generating an audit log entry that includes field name, label, old value, new value, and creation details.
    *   **`compareObjectsGeneric`:** (Truncated) Appears to be a more generalized comparison function for arrays of objects, including a `normalizeValue` helper to handle different data types consistently.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database Interactions:** Both files heavily rely on database operations (`query`, `insertQuery`, `insertMany`, `updateQuery`).
*   **Error Handling:** A consistent pattern of `try...catch` blocks is used in service functions, logging errors and returning `HttpStatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.
*   **Auditing Integration:** The `simpleAudit` function from `auditModules.ts` is actively used within `customerService.ts` to log specific events during customer creation, indicating a robust auditing requirement for critical business operations.
*   **Configuration-Driven Auditing:** The `auditModules.ts` utilizes an external `auditConfigObj` to determine how and what to audit, promoting maintainability and flexibility.
*   **Transactional Integrity:** Critical data modification operations in `customerService.ts` (`saveCustomerDetails`, `CreateCustomer`) are wrapped in database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure atomicity and data consistency.
*   **Dynamic Query Building:** `customerService.ts` uses a `QueryBuilder` utility for constructing complex SQL queries for data retrieval and filtering, making the queries more manageable and less prone to SQL injection.
*   **Data Parsing:** `CreateCustomer` explicitly handles parsing `gstLocations` and `uploadDocuments` that might be passed as stringified JSON, indicating flexibility in API request body formats.
