# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:35:11 AM
The provided log entry details the `AnalyticsScreen.jsx` file as of **10/23/2025, 3:18:36 PM**. This file represents the main screen for the analytics feature in the `t360-frontend` application.

**File-Specific Updates (`AnalyticsScreen.jsx`):**

This component serves as the orchestrator for displaying analytics data. Its key functionalities include:

*   **State Management:** It heavily utilizes Redux, accessing global state for `analytics` (`mainState`), `settings` (`settingsState`), and `auth.user`. It dispatches actions to update `analyticsSlice` with fetched data, loading states, and selected customer information.
*   **Data Fetching with RTK Query:** The screen integrates Redux Toolkit Query for efficient data fetching:
    *   `useFetchDashboardsQuery`: Fetches available dashboards based on the user's company and role upon component mount.
    *   `useLazyFetchEndpointsQuery`: Lazily fetches specific analytics endpoints (e.g., list of reports) based on the `selectedDashboard`.
    *   `useLazyFetchReportQuery`: Lazily fetches individual reports based on the determined endpoints.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard and Report Loading:**
    *   An `useEffect` hook initializes the dashboard state with `dashboardViews` once successfully fetched.
    *   A primary `useEffect` handles the core data fetching logic:
        *   It determines whether to use `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` or fetch custom endpoints based on `mainState.selectedDashobard`.
        *   It then proceeds to fetch all associated reports concurrently using `Promise.all`, applying an initial date range (`year_2_date`) and formatting dates with `moment`. Each report query includes parameters like `apiKey`, `reportName`, `userid`, date range, `displayBy`, `viewBy`, `companyname`, and `access`.
        *   Fetched data is processed by `metricsPackageHandler` and dispatched to the Redux store.
        *   Loading states are managed, showing a `Loader` during data fetching.
*   **User Role-Based Logic:**
    *   If the user's `role` is 'CUSTOMER', their `companyname` is automatically set as the `selectedCustomer`.
    *   The UI displays an `Alert` for 'ADMIN' users if no customer is selected.
*   **UI Structure:** The screen incorporates common UI components like `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedBreadcrumb`, and `AnalyticsToolbar`. The core analytics content is rendered within `AnalyticsContainer`, conditional on loading state and customer selection.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux-Centric Architecture:** Frequent use of `useSelector` to retrieve data from the Redux store and `useDispatch` to trigger state updates, demonstrating a strong reliance on Redux for application state management.
*   **API Query Patterns:** API calls through RTK Query consistently include `companyname`, `access`, and `userid` in their query parameters, indicating a pattern of multi-tenancy or role-based access control for analytics data.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The component makes extensive use of conditional rendering based on `isLoading` states, `user.role`, and the presence of `selectedCustomer` to manage the user experience.
*   **Asynchronous Data Flow:** Multiple `useEffect` hooks and `async/await` patterns are employed to manage the sequential and concurrent fetching of different data sets (dashboards, endpoints, reports), ensuring data dependencies are met.
*   **Utility Functions:** Integration of utility functions like `dateFilterHandle` and `metricsPackageHandler` suggests a modular approach to handling common data manipulation and formatting tasks.

## 9:35:14 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` was updated on `10/22/2025, 11:01:53 AM`.

This file, an Express router, defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints for an analytics module. Key updates include:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are exposed for `/dashboards` endpoints, handled by `core.view.controller`.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Discovery:** Endpoints `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are added to retrieve lists of available dashboard endpoints and metrics, respectively, managed by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **User Preferences:** New POST routes `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` are introduced for saving user-specific preferences related to analytics views or data presentation.
*   **Reporting Endpoints:** Multiple dedicated GET endpoints are added for various types of reports, including `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and `/Tables/tableData`, each leveraging specific controllers (`cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`, `teu.controller`, `container.controller`, `transit.controller`, `others.controller`).
*   **Data Export:** An endpoint `/excelExport` is added to facilitate data export functionality, handled by `core.export.controller`.

The changes reflect an expansion of the analytics module, introducing more granular control over dashboards, extensive reporting capabilities, and mechanisms for user preferences and data export. The pattern observed is the modular organization of analytics functionalities, with each major feature area (views, metrics, specific report types, export) managed by its own dedicated controller imported into this central route definition file.

## 9:35:43 AM
The provided log details significant development work on a new "Analytics" feature within the T360-V2 frontend application, primarily occurring on **October 23, 2025**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\App.tsx`**:
    *   Initially (3:20:46 PM), an `/app/analytics` route was present but incorrectly pointed to `ShipmentWithContainersPage`.
    *   By 3:22:00 PM, the application's main routing was updated to correctly import and render the new `AnalyticsScreen` component for the `/app/analytics` path.
*   **`src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx`**:
    *   The core `AnalyticsScreen` component was established (3:21:50 PM). It manages fetching dashboard views and reports using Redux Toolkit Query, handles loading states, and dispatches analytics-related actions.
    *   Throughout subsequent changes (3:51:34 PM, 3:52:16 PM, 4:03:08 PM, 4:03:54 PM), there was extensive refactoring of import paths, transitioning from relative paths to absolute paths or aliases (e.g., `@components`, `config/analytics`, `utils/utils`).
    *   The UI structure was modified (4:03:08 PM) to use a `PageWrapper` component for layout instead of directly combining `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedBreadcrumb`, and `AnalyticsToolbar`.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`**:
    *   This new component (3:24:36 PM) was introduced to display various analytics charts (Bar, Pie, Line, Stacked Bar, Gauge). It features a toolbar for chart controls, a footer, and full-screen modal functionality. A minor cleanup of an unused import happened later (3:33:45 PM).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsContainer.jsx` (later `.tsx`)**:
    *   Introduced as `.jsx` (3:27:17 PM), this component is central to the analytics dashboard layout. It utilizes `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop reordering and `react-resizable` for changing the size of metric boxes. It includes Redux Toolkit Query mutations (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`) to persist layout changes.
    *   The file was renamed to `.tsx` (3:27:30 PM), indicating a move towards TypeScript. Numerous import path corrections followed, culminating in a specific TypeScript type import (`RootState`) and explicit typing for Redux selectors (3:42:56 PM).
    *   A notable change (3:46:41 PM) involved potentially incorrect Redux selector usage (`state.analyticsApi`, `state.setting`).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\ResizableGridItem.jsx`**:
    *   This component (3:30:21 PM) provides the draggable and resizable functionality for individual items within the `AnalyticsContainer`, using `react-resizable` and `react-dnd`.
    *   A minor refactoring changed it to a default export (3:30:28 PM). Subsequent entries (3:31:01 PM, 3:31:28 PM) show identical code, likely representing frequent saves during development.
*   **`src\store\api\analytics-api.ts`**:
    *   This Redux Toolkit Query API slice was created (3:39:04 PM) to handle all analytics-related API interactions (fetching reports, dashboards, saving layouts).
    *   A key improvement (3:40:00 PM) was the addition of `"SEQ"` and `"SIZE"` to `tagTypes` to enable proper cache invalidation for layout-related mutations.
*   **`src\store\store.ts`**:
    *   The main Redux store was updated (3:44:26 PM) to integrate the `analyticsApi` reducer and middleware, making it globally available.
*   **`src\config\analytics.ts`**:
    *   This new configuration file (3:52:59 PM) centralizes constants such as `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`, `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`, and `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`, providing a single source of truth for analytics-specific configurations.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`**:
    *   A new utility file (3:58:24 PM) was introduced to house helper functions for analytics, including `metricsPackageHandler` (data processing), `allChartOptions`, `chartOptionsByType`, `reportFormula`, `weekDateFormater`, and `downloadReportSpreadsheet` (Excel export logic).
*   **`src\store\fretures\analytics-slice.ts`**:
    *   This Redux slice (4:01:14 PM) manages the state specific to the analytics feature, including endpoints, metrics data, date filters, selected dashboards, and loading status.
    *   An import path for `dateFilterHandle` was corrected (4:02:19 PM) to align with utility file reorganization.
*   **`src\utils\utils.ts`**:
    *   This general utility file (4:02:02 PM) was added to consolidate common helper functions such as `appDateFormat`, `parseRawString`, `useDateFormate` (for user-preference-based date formatting), and `dateFilterHandle` (for generating various date ranges).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The development timeline shows concentrated efforts on October 23, 2025, starting with initial routing for analytics (3:20 PM), followed by the creation of core analytics components (`AnalyticsScreen`, `MetricsBox`, `AnalyticsContainer`, `ResizableGridItem`) between 3:21 PM and 3:30 PM. The Redux Toolkit Query API slice for analytics (`analytics-api.ts`) was set up around 3:39 PM, with a crucial update to cache invalidation tags at 3:40 PM. The Redux store (`store.ts`) was updated to include analytics by 3:44 PM. Later, configuration (`config/analytics.ts`, 3:52 PM), analytics-specific utilities (`methods.ts`, 3:58 PM), the Redux analytics state slice (`analytics-slice.ts`, 4:01 PM), and general utilities (`utils.ts`, 4:02 PM) were added, demonstrating a structured rollout of the feature.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature-Driven Development:** The entire log reflects the sequential development and integration of a new "Analytics" feature.

    *   **Refinements (10/22/2025, 12:31:11 PM - 12:46:12 PM):** Imports were updated for better type safety (`IAuthReq`, `Response`, `NextFunction`, `CheckBoxDetails`), function signatures were adjusted, and optional chaining (`user?.usercode`) was added for robustness. A significant security enhancement was made by switching SQL `INSERT` and `UPDATE` queries to use parameterized queries (`$1, $2, $3::int[]`) instead of string interpolation for sensitive data like `dashboard_metrics` and `user_id`, mitigating SQL injection risks.

*   **`src\services\coreMetricService.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:11:45 PM):** Introduced `dashboardEndPointList` to fetch and sort dashboard metrics and their display properties (row/column span).
    *   **Expansion (10/22/2025, 4:17:27 PM - 4:38:20 PM):**
        *   `getMetricList` was added to retrieve and categorize available metrics (`Container_Wise`, `MBL_Wise`) and optionally preload their selection status for a given dashboard.
        *   `saveSequence` was implemented to store the order of reports in a dashboard, including logic for a "Default" dashboard.
        *   `saveSize` was added to store layout information (columnSpan, rowSpan) for individual reports within a dashboard.
        *   Improvements were made to type safety with explicit type guards and nullish coalescing operators.

*   **`src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:40:11 PM):** Introduced `getExportData` for generating report export files. This service dynamically constructs SQL queries based on various parameters (date range, report name, booking status, columns, display options), applies date filtering, and includes specific column value replacements (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES").
    *   **Refactoring (10/22/2025, 4:47:46 PM):** Imports were updated to use `@src` aliases, `IAuthReq` was adopted for request types, and `userCode` handling for `saveColumns` was made more robust.
    *   **Minor Inconsistency (10/22/2025, 6:08:54 PM):** The import for `nonBookingQuery` was removed, despite the function still being called in the service logic, indicating a potential oversight or a related unlogged change in `export.query.ts`.

*   **`src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:43:56 PM):** A utility file for analytics was created, containing helpers such as `defaultDateRange`, `replaceValueInQuery` (for SQL column transformation), `getUserObject` (for user context), `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` (for SQL aggregation), `getExcelSelectedColumns` (for dynamic column selection), `isValidDate`, `dateFilterOnExport` (for date formatting), and `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` (a list of default export columns).
    *   **Type Safety (10/22/2025, 5:09:52 PM):** Type interfaces (`User`, `UserRow`, `DataItem`) and explicit return types were added to functions, enhancing code predictability and error detection.

*   **`src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM):** This utility file was created to house complex, dynamically generated SQL query fragments specific to various analytics reports. It includes `getMonthValue` for date conversion and a large `bookingQuery` function that branches logic based on report names and display parameters.

*   **`src\models\common\types\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Progressive Definition (10/22/2025, 12:27:34 PM - 4:36:01 PM):** This file saw continuous additions and refinements of interfaces to support the analytics module:
        *   `CheckBoxDetails`: For metrics selection.
        *   `MenuRow`: For dashboard titles, later expanded to include `metricsId`, `dashboard_metrics`, and `size`.
        *   `DashboardItem`: For individual metric components within a dashboard, later adding `dashboard_name`.
        *   `MetricListDataI`: For the comprehensive list of metrics with grouping and filtering.
        *   `MetricRow`: For basic metric ID and name.

*   **Modularization:** The code is structured into distinct services (`coreViewService`, `coreMetricService`, `analyticsExportService`) and utilities (`analytics.ts`, `export.query.ts`) reflecting a clear separation of concerns.

## 10:35:06 AM
The `AnalyticsScreen.jsx` file, last modified on `10/23/2025, 3:18:36 PM`, represents a React component central to the application's analytics functionality.

**File-specific updates in `AnalyticsScreen.jsx`:**

*   **Core Functionality**: The component serves as the main analytics screen, orchestrating the fetching and display of various analytics reports.
*   **State Management**: It extensively uses Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) to manage application state. It interacts with the `analytics`, `settings`, and `auth` Redux slices to retrieve selected customer, dashboard, loading status, user details (role, company name, ID), and display formatting.
*   **Data Fetching**: It employs RTK Query for efficient data fetching:
    *   `useFetchDashboardsQuery`: Fetches available dashboards based on the user's role and selected company.
    *   `useLazyFetchEndpointsQuery`: Lazily fetches specific analytics endpoints for a selected custom dashboard.
    *   `useLazyFetchReportQuery`: Lazily fetches individual reports based on a given URL and query parameters.
*   **Data Flow and Effects (`useEffect`)**:
    *   An initial `useEffect` populates the Redux `dashboard` state once dashboard views are successfully fetched and a user ID is available.
    *   A primary `useEffect` handles the core data fetching logic:
        *   It dynamically determines whether to use `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` or fetch custom endpoints based on the `selectedDashobard`.
        *   It then concurrently fetches multiple reports using `Promise.all` based on the determined endpoints.
        *   Report queries include parameters like `apiKey` (hardcoded "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"), `reportName`, `userid`, a date range (defaulting to "year_2_date" using `dateFilterHandle`), `displayBy`, `viewBy`, `companyname`, and `access`.
        *   Fetched data is processed by `metricsPackageHandler` and dispatched to the Redux `allMetric` state.
        *   Loading states are managed using `setLoading` actions.
    *   A separate `useEffect` automatically sets the selected customer if the user's role is 'CUSTOMER'.
*   **User Interface**:
    *   The screen incorporates common UI components like `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedBreadcrumb`, and `AnalyticsToolbar`.
    *   It displays a `Loader` when data is being fetched.
    *   It conditionally renders an `Alert` if an 'ADMIN' user has not selected a customer, or the main `AnalyticsContainer` once data is ready.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:

*   **Redux-centric State Management**: The component is heavily integrated with Redux for managing global application state, reflecting a common pattern in the project for data flow.
*   **RTK Query for API Interactions**: All data fetching is handled through RTK Query hooks, indicating a consistent approach to API calls across the application.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: Extensive use of conditional rendering based on user roles, loading states, and data availability (`user.role`, `mainState.isLoading`, `mainState.selectedCustomer`).
*   **Date Handling**: `moment` and `dateFilterHandle` are used for consistent date range calculations for report queries.
*   **Modular Component Structure**: The use of `AnalyticsContainer`, `AnalyticsToolbar`, `ScreenToolbar`, `Loader`, and `Breadcrumb` suggests a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Hardcoded API Key**: The presence of `apiKey: "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"` directly within the code for `fetchReport` calls is a recurring pattern for API interaction, though this specific instance is hardcoded.

## 10:35:09 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` was updated on 10/22/2025, 11:01:53 AM. This file primarily defines the API routes for various analytics functionalities within the `t360-backend`.

Key updates include:
*   **Dashboard Management:** Routes for retrieving all dashboards (`/dashboards` GET), creating (`/dashboards` POST), updating (`/dashboards` PUT), and deleting (`/dashboards` DELETE) dashboards.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Listing:** Endpoints for fetching dashboard endpoints (`/dashboardEndPoints`) and a list of metrics (`/metricsList`).
*   **Data Export:** A route for exporting data to Excel (`/excelExport`).
*   **User Preferences:** Routes for saving user preferences related to sequence (`/save_sequence`) and size (`/save_size`).
*   **Reporting:** Multiple dedicated routes for various analytical reports, including CBM (`/cbm`), KGS (`/kgs`), TEU (`/teu`), container details (`/containers`), transit information (`/transit`), and general table data (`/Tables/tableData`).

A clear pattern is the consolidation of numerous analytics-specific endpoints into this single route file, leveraging multiple specialized controllers (e.g., `cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`, `teu.controller`, `container.controller`, `transit.controller`, `others.controller`) to handle diverse reporting and dashboard management tasks.

## 10:36:02 AM

    *   **3:21:50 PM**: This file was introduced or significantly updated to define the core `AnalyticsScreen` component. It leverages Redux Toolkit Query to fetch dashboard views, endpoints, and reports, manages loading states, and dispatches analytics-related state updates. A hardcoded API key (`apiKey: "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"`) is present within the report fetch query.
    *   **3:52:16 PM**: The import path for `AnalyticsContainer` was updated to use a path alias (`@components`).
    *   **4:03:08 PM**: Underwent a major refactor, updating numerous import paths from relative paths to aliases for Redux API, slice modules, configuration, and common components. The page's layout also changed significantly, replacing `ScreenToolbar` and `ThemedBreadcrumb` with a `PageWrapper` component for a more structured header.
    *   **4:03:54 PM**: Further refined import paths, specifically for `dateFilterHandle`, to use the `utils/utils` alias, and removed any remaining obsolete imports.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`**
    *   **3:24:36 PM**: This component was introduced to display individual analytics metrics within a box. It dynamically renders various chart types (Bar, Pie, Line, StackedBar, Gauge), manages chart view selections, and provides a full-screen modal for detailed chart inspection.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsContainer.jsx` (and subsequent `.tsx` versions)**
    *   **3:27:17 PM**: Initially created as `AnalyticsContainer.jsx`, this component handles the grid layout for analytics metric boxes. It integrates `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop reordering and `react-resizable` for resizing. It also dispatches actions to save metric sequence and size to the backend via Redux mutations.
    *   **3:27:30 PM**: The file was renamed/copied to `AnalyticsContainer.tsx`, transitioning to TypeScript without functional changes.
    *   **3:32:02 PM**: A previously removed `MetricsBox` import was corrected (re-added with a casing adjustment), and Redux slice imports were updated.
    *   **3:42:56 PM**: TypeScript `RootState` type annotations were added to Redux `useSelector` hooks, enhancing type safety.
    *   **3:46:41 PM**: Introduced potential errors by modifying Redux state selectors (e.g., `state.analytics` to `state.analyticsApi`, `state.settings` to `state.setting`), which might cause runtime issues.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\ResizableGridItem.jsx`**
    *   **3:30:21 PM**: This component was introduced to enable individual grid items to be both resizable and draggable within the `AnalyticsContainer`. It leverages `react-resizable` to adjust column and row spans based on size, and `react-dnd` for reordering.
    *   **3:30:28 PM**: The component's export type was changed from a named export to a default export.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\api\analytics-api.ts`**
    *   **3:39:04 PM**: This file was added to define the `analyticsApi` using Redux Toolkit Query. It includes endpoints for fetching dashboard data and mutations for saving metric order (`saveSequence`) and size (`saveMetricSize`). The initial version had an oversight with undefined `tagTypes`.
    *   **3:40:00 PM**: The `tagTypes` array was corrected by adding `"SEQ"` and `"SIZE"`, ensuring proper cache invalidation for related mutations.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\store.ts`**
    *   **3:44:26 PM**: The `analyticsApi` reducer and its middleware were successfully integrated into the application's global Redux store, making analytics data and functionalities available throughout the application.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\config\analytics.ts`**
    *   **3:52:59 PM**: This new configuration file was added. It defines `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` for various reports (e.g., CBM, TEU metrics), `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` for spreadsheet exports, and a detailed `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` mapping report names to their respective display column headers for both container-wise and MBL-wise reports.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`**
    *   **3:58:24 PM**: This file was added to centralize utility functions for the analytics feature. It includes `metricsPackageHandler` for data transformation, functions for managing chart options (`allChartOptions`, `chartOptionsByType`), `reportFormula` for calculating report-specific metrics, and `downloadReportSpreadsheet` for robust Excel export capabilities, handling different report structures and filters.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\fretures\analytics-slice.ts`**
    *   **4:01:14 PM**: This Redux slice was introduced to manage the state specific to the analytics dashboard. It defines initial states for endpoints, metrics, date filters (global and local), dashboard selections, loading status, and user interaction types (resize/move). It also includes reducers to update these states.
    *   **4:02:19 PM**: The import path for `dateFilterHandle` was updated to `utils/utils`, reflecting a move towards centralized utilities.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\utils\utils.ts`**
    *   **4:02:02 PM**: This utility file was introduced, providing general helper functions such as `appDateFormat` for consistent date formatting, `parseRawString` for data cleaning, `useDateFormate` for dynamic date formatting based on user preferences, and a comprehensive `dateFilterHandle` to calculate date ranges for various common time filters.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a concentrated effort on developing and integrating a new, interactive analytics dashboard. Key patterns include:

*   **Dedicated Feature Development**: The sheer volume of new and modified files within the `analytics` directory structure highlights a focused sprint on this feature.
*   **Redux Toolkit & RTK Query**: These libraries are central to the new analytics feature for both managing global state (`analytics-slice.ts`) and handling all API interactions (`analytics-api.ts`).
*   **Interactive UI**: The use of `react-dnd` and `react-resizable` in `AnalyticsContainer` and `ResizableGridItem` indicates a strong emphasis on user customization and interactivity for dashboard layouts.
*   **Code Standardization and Refactoring**: There is a clear pattern of updating import paths to use path aliases (e.g., `@components`, `config`, `utils`) instead of relative paths, which suggests an ongoing effort to standardize the project's module resolution. The transition from `.jsx` to `.tsx` files also points towards increased adoption of TypeScript.
*   **Centralized Date Handling**: A robust approach to date filtering and formatting is evident, with a dedicated `dateFilterHandle` utility function and consistent use of `moment.js` across analytics components.
*   **Hardcoded API Key**: The presence of a hardcoded `apiKey` in `src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx` is a recurring element, representing a potential security concern.

    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:11:45 PM)** New file created with `dashboardEndPointList`, a function to retrieve ordered dashboard metrics and their display properties (`rowSpan`, `columnSpan`) from the `metrics` and `dashboards` tables.
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:17:27 PM)** Added `getMetricList`, which fetches and categorizes metrics by `filter_by` ("Container_Wise", "MBL_Wise") and `group`, supporting a "preload" feature to mark already selected metrics for a dashboard.
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:21:55 PM)** Enhanced type safety and null checks for `dashboard_name` and `user.usercode` in `getMetricList`.
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:27:44 PM)** Implemented `saveSequence` to update the order of metrics in a dashboard and `saveSize` to store layout (column/row span) properties for individual metrics. These functions interact with the `dashboards` table.
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:32:09 PM - 4:38:20 PM)** Further improved type safety in `saveSequence` and `saveSize`, explicitly handling `undefined` values and ensuring correct type casting. Changed `AuthenticatedRequest` to `IAuthReq`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:40:11 PM)** New file created, introducing `getExportData` for generating detailed Excel exports. This function dynamically constructs complex SQL queries based on numerous parameters (report type, date ranges, columns, booking status, stacking options). It includes logic for date filtering, column replacement (`LONG BEACH` to `LOS ANGELES`), and special handling for "TEU MBLwise" reports.
    *   **(10/22/2025, 6:08:54 PM - 10/23/2025, 11:04:38 AM)** Refined type handling for `userCode` when calling `saveColumns`. A potential issue was introduced or persisted where `nonBookingQuery` is called but not imported explicitly in the latest entries for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:43:56 PM)** New file containing several utility functions: `defaultDateRange` (for date calculations), `replaceValueInQuery` (for dynamic SQL column replacement), `getUserObject` (for user and company context retrieval), `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` (for dynamic date-based SQL grouping/ordering), `getExcelSelectedColumns` (for dynamic column selection in exports), `dateFilterOnExport` (for validating and formatting dates in export data), and `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` (a constant for export column definitions).
    *   **(10/22/2025, 5:09:52 PM)** Enhanced type safety by introducing `User` and `UserRow` interfaces and adding explicit type castings and null checks in relevant functions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **(10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM)** New file created. Contains `getMonthValue` helper and `bookingQuery`, a function responsible for generating detailed SQL `WHERE` clauses for various booking-related analytics reports, including logic for stacked bar charts.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The development activity was highly concentrated on **October 22, 2025**.
*   **Early afternoon (12:19 PM - 12:46 PM):** Initial setup of analytics API paths, core view services (CRUD for dashboards, audit logging), and basic type definitions.
*   **Late afternoon (4:05 PM - 4:47 PM):** Rapid expansion with new types for dashboard items and metrics, creation of `coreMetricService` (for endpoint lists, metric selection, saving sequence/size), and introduction of `analyticsExportService` (for Excel exports) and `utils/analytics.ts` (for helper functions and dynamic SQL generation).
*   **Evening (5:09 PM - 6:08 PM) and next day (10/23/2025, 11:00 AM - 11:04 AM):** Refinement of type safety across `utils/analytics.ts` and `analyticsExportService.ts`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Analytics-Centric Development:** The entire log details the construction of a comprehensive analytics module, covering dashboard view management, metric configuration, and data export.
2.  **Modular Design:** The project adheres to a clear separation of concerns, utilizing `constants` for paths, `routes` for API definitions, `services` for business logic, `models` for data structures, and `utils` for common helpers.
3.  **Extensive Use of TypeScript:** There's a strong pattern of progressively adding and refining interfaces (`CheckBoxDetails`, `MenuRow`, `DashboardItem`, etc.) and type annotations (`IAuthReq`, `Response`, `as string`) to improve code robustness and maintainability, especially apparent in `coreViewService.ts`, `coreMetricService.ts`, and `utils/analytics.ts`.
4.  **Database Interaction:** All services heavily rely on a `query` function (presumably a PostgreSQL client wrapper) for data retrieval and manipulation, interacting with `dashboards`, `metrics`, `mtr_user_master`, `mtr_tracking_data`, and `agent_booking_entry` tables.
5.  **Dynamic SQL Generation:** Complex SQL queries are built dynamically based on user inputs and report parameters, particularly in `analyticsExportService.ts` and `export.query.ts`. Parameterized queries are adopted for security and type correctness.
6.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent implementation of `try...catch` blocks for error management and extensive use of a `logger` for debugging and operational insights across all services.
7.  **Audit Trail:** The `logAudit` function demonstrates a requirement to maintain a record of changes made to dashboard configurations.
8.  **Data Transformation:** Functions like `dateFilterOnExport` and `replaceColumnHandler` are used to standardize and format data before it's presented or exported.
9.  **API Route Definition:** A repetitive pattern of importing service functions and mapping them to specific `Paths.Analytics` endpoints using `express.Router()`.
10. **Refinement and Correction:** An observable pattern of initial implementation followed by quick corrections and refinements, such as fixing misrouted analytics endpoints or enhancing type safety. A potential regression was observed with the `nonBookingQuery` import in `analyticsExportService.ts`.

## 11:35:08 AM
The `AnalyticsScreen.jsx` file, updated on 10/23/2025 at 3:18:36 PM, serves as the main entry point for the analytics dashboard in the `t360-frontend` application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Redux Integration:** The component extensively uses Redux for state management, dispatching actions to `setDashboard`, `setEndpoints`, `setAllMetric`, `setCustomer`, and `setLoading` from the `analyticsSlice`. It also selects `mainState` (analytics), `settingsState`, and `user` (authentication) from the store.
*   **API Interactions (RTK Query):**
    *   `useFetchDashboardsQuery` is used to initially fetch available dashboards based on the user's role and selected company.
    *   `useLazyFetchEndpointsQuery` is employed to dynamically fetch analytics endpoints (menu items) based on the `selectedDashobard`.
    *   `useLazyFetchReportQuery` is used to fetch individual analytics reports.
*   **Data Fetching Logic:**
    *   An initial `useEffect` populates the Redux store with dashboard views once successfully fetched.
    *   A primary `useEffect` orchestrates the fetching of endpoints and subsequent reports:
        *   It first determines whether to use `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` or fetch custom endpoints based on `mainState.selectedDashobard`.
        *   It then calls `fetchAllReports`, which uses `Promise.all` to concurrently fetch data for all determined endpoints. Each report fetch includes parameters like `apiKey`, `reportName`, `userid`, `fromDate`, `toDate`, `displayBy`, `viewBy`, `companyname`, and `access`.
        *   A hardcoded `apiKey: "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"` is present in the report query.
        *   Fetched data is processed by `metricsPackageHandler` and dispatched to the Redux store.
*   **User Role Handling:**
    *   If the user's role is 'CUSTOMER', their `companyname` is automatically set as the `selectedCustomer`.
    *   The UI displays an `Alert` for 'ADMIN' users if no customer is selected, prompting them to choose one.
*   **UI Components:** The screen incorporates common UI elements like `ScreenToolbar` with `ThemedBreadcrumb` and `AnalyticsToolbar`, a `Loader` for loading states, and an `AnalyticsContainer` to display the actual analytics content. Material UI `Box` and `Alert` components are also used.
*   **Date Management:** `moment` and `dateFilterHandle` are utilized to manage date ranges for report queries, specifically setting an `initialDateRange` to "year_2_date".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Chained Data Fetching:** A clear pattern of fetching dashboards, then endpoints based on selection, and finally multiple reports based on those endpoints.
*   **Redux as Central State:** Heavy reliance on Redux for managing loading states, user selections (customer, dashboard), and all fetched analytics data.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The component frequently uses conditional rendering (`isLoading`, `user.role`, `selectedCustomer`) to display appropriate UI elements or loaders.
*   **API Query Parameters:** Consistent use of `companyname`, `access`, and `userid` across multiple API calls, indicating role-based and company-specific data access.
*   **Date Filtering:** All report queries include dynamic `fromDate` and `toDate` parameters, highlighting a standardized date filtering mechanism.

## 11:35:10 AM
The `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` file was updated on 10/22/2025 at 11:01:53 AM.

This file serves as the central routing definition for the analytics module within the `t360-backend`. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Comprehensive Analytics Endpoints:** The route defines a wide array of endpoints for managing and retrieving analytics data.
*   **Dashboard Management:** It includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for dashboards via `/dashboards` endpoints.
*   **Metric and Configuration Retrieval:** Endpoints like `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are provided to fetch available dashboard configurations and metric definitions.
*   **Data Export:** A dedicated endpoint `/excelExport` is available for exporting analytics data.
*   **User Preferences:** Functionality for saving user preferences related to dashboard display, specifically `save_sequence` and `save_size`, is included.
*   **Specific Report Access:** Several dedicated endpoints are defined to fetch various types of reports, including `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and a generic `/Tables/tableData` endpoint for other reports.

The updates consolidate various analytics-related functionalities, ranging from dashboard management and user preferences to specific data reports and export capabilities, all pointing to different controllers under an `analytics` directory.
