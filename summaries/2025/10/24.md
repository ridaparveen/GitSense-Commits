# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:35:11 AM
The provided log entry details the `AnalyticsScreen.jsx` file as of **10/23/2025, 3:18:36 PM**. This file represents the main screen for the analytics feature in the `t360-frontend` application.

**File-Specific Updates (`AnalyticsScreen.jsx`):**

This component serves as the orchestrator for displaying analytics data. Its key functionalities include:

*   **State Management:** It heavily utilizes Redux, accessing global state for `analytics` (`mainState`), `settings` (`settingsState`), and `auth.user`. It dispatches actions to update `analyticsSlice` with fetched data, loading states, and selected customer information.
*   **Data Fetching with RTK Query:** The screen integrates Redux Toolkit Query for efficient data fetching:
    *   `useFetchDashboardsQuery`: Fetches available dashboards based on the user's company and role upon component mount.
    *   `useLazyFetchEndpointsQuery`: Lazily fetches specific analytics endpoints (e.g., list of reports) based on the `selectedDashboard`.
    *   `useLazyFetchReportQuery`: Lazily fetches individual reports based on the determined endpoints.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard and Report Loading:**
    *   An `useEffect` hook initializes the dashboard state with `dashboardViews` once successfully fetched.
    *   A primary `useEffect` handles the core data fetching logic:
        *   It determines whether to use `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` or fetch custom endpoints based on `mainState.selectedDashobard`.
        *   It then proceeds to fetch all associated reports concurrently using `Promise.all`, applying an initial date range (`year_2_date`) and formatting dates with `moment`. Each report query includes parameters like `apiKey`, `reportName`, `userid`, date range, `displayBy`, `viewBy`, `companyname`, and `access`.
        *   Fetched data is processed by `metricsPackageHandler` and dispatched to the Redux store.
        *   Loading states are managed, showing a `Loader` during data fetching.
*   **User Role-Based Logic:**
    *   If the user's `role` is 'CUSTOMER', their `companyname` is automatically set as the `selectedCustomer`.
    *   The UI displays an `Alert` for 'ADMIN' users if no customer is selected.
*   **UI Structure:** The screen incorporates common UI components like `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedBreadcrumb`, and `AnalyticsToolbar`. The core analytics content is rendered within `AnalyticsContainer`, conditional on loading state and customer selection.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux-Centric Architecture:** Frequent use of `useSelector` to retrieve data from the Redux store and `useDispatch` to trigger state updates, demonstrating a strong reliance on Redux for application state management.
*   **API Query Patterns:** API calls through RTK Query consistently include `companyname`, `access`, and `userid` in their query parameters, indicating a pattern of multi-tenancy or role-based access control for analytics data.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The component makes extensive use of conditional rendering based on `isLoading` states, `user.role`, and the presence of `selectedCustomer` to manage the user experience.
*   **Asynchronous Data Flow:** Multiple `useEffect` hooks and `async/await` patterns are employed to manage the sequential and concurrent fetching of different data sets (dashboards, endpoints, reports), ensuring data dependencies are met.
*   **Utility Functions:** Integration of utility functions like `dateFilterHandle` and `metricsPackageHandler` suggests a modular approach to handling common data manipulation and formatting tasks.

## 9:35:14 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` was updated on `10/22/2025, 11:01:53 AM`.

This file, an Express router, defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints for an analytics module. Key updates include:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are exposed for `/dashboards` endpoints, handled by `core.view.controller`.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Discovery:** Endpoints `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are added to retrieve lists of available dashboard endpoints and metrics, respectively, managed by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **User Preferences:** New POST routes `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` are introduced for saving user-specific preferences related to analytics views or data presentation.
*   **Reporting Endpoints:** Multiple dedicated GET endpoints are added for various types of reports, including `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and `/Tables/tableData`, each leveraging specific controllers (`cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`, `teu.controller`, `container.controller`, `transit.controller`, `others.controller`).
*   **Data Export:** An endpoint `/excelExport` is added to facilitate data export functionality, handled by `core.export.controller`.

The changes reflect an expansion of the analytics module, introducing more granular control over dashboards, extensive reporting capabilities, and mechanisms for user preferences and data export. The pattern observed is the modular organization of analytics functionalities, with each major feature area (views, metrics, specific report types, export) managed by its own dedicated controller imported into this central route definition file.

## 9:35:43 AM
The provided log details significant development work on a new "Analytics" feature within the T360-V2 frontend application, primarily occurring on **October 23, 2025**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\App.tsx`**:
    *   Initially (3:20:46 PM), an `/app/analytics` route was present but incorrectly pointed to `ShipmentWithContainersPage`.
    *   By 3:22:00 PM, the application's main routing was updated to correctly import and render the new `AnalyticsScreen` component for the `/app/analytics` path.
*   **`src\pages\analytics\analytics-page.tsx`**:
    *   The core `AnalyticsScreen` component was established (3:21:50 PM). It manages fetching dashboard views and reports using Redux Toolkit Query, handles loading states, and dispatches analytics-related actions.
    *   Throughout subsequent changes (3:51:34 PM, 3:52:16 PM, 4:03:08 PM, 4:03:54 PM), there was extensive refactoring of import paths, transitioning from relative paths to absolute paths or aliases (e.g., `@components`, `config/analytics`, `utils/utils`).
    *   The UI structure was modified (4:03:08 PM) to use a `PageWrapper` component for layout instead of directly combining `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedBreadcrumb`, and `AnalyticsToolbar`.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`**:
    *   This new component (3:24:36 PM) was introduced to display various analytics charts (Bar, Pie, Line, Stacked Bar, Gauge). It features a toolbar for chart controls, a footer, and full-screen modal functionality. A minor cleanup of an unused import happened later (3:33:45 PM).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsContainer.jsx` (later `.tsx`)**:
    *   Introduced as `.jsx` (3:27:17 PM), this component is central to the analytics dashboard layout. It utilizes `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop reordering and `react-resizable` for changing the size of metric boxes. It includes Redux Toolkit Query mutations (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`) to persist layout changes.
    *   The file was renamed to `.tsx` (3:27:30 PM), indicating a move towards TypeScript. Numerous import path corrections followed, culminating in a specific TypeScript type import (`RootState`) and explicit typing for Redux selectors (3:42:56 PM).
    *   A notable change (3:46:41 PM) involved potentially incorrect Redux selector usage (`state.analyticsApi`, `state.setting`).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\ResizableGridItem.jsx`**:
    *   This component (3:30:21 PM) provides the draggable and resizable functionality for individual items within the `AnalyticsContainer`, using `react-resizable` and `react-dnd`.
    *   A minor refactoring changed it to a default export (3:30:28 PM). Subsequent entries (3:31:01 PM, 3:31:28 PM) show identical code, likely representing frequent saves during development.
*   **`src\store\api\analytics-api.ts`**:
    *   This Redux Toolkit Query API slice was created (3:39:04 PM) to handle all analytics-related API interactions (fetching reports, dashboards, saving layouts).
    *   A key improvement (3:40:00 PM) was the addition of `"SEQ"` and `"SIZE"` to `tagTypes` to enable proper cache invalidation for layout-related mutations.
*   **`src\store\store.ts`**:
    *   The main Redux store was updated (3:44:26 PM) to integrate the `analyticsApi` reducer and middleware, making it globally available.
*   **`src\config\analytics.ts`**:
    *   This new configuration file (3:52:59 PM) centralizes constants such as `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`, `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`, and `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`, providing a single source of truth for analytics-specific configurations.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`**:
    *   A new utility file (3:58:24 PM) was introduced to house helper functions for analytics, including `metricsPackageHandler` (data processing), `allChartOptions`, `chartOptionsByType`, `reportFormula`, `weekDateFormater`, and `downloadReportSpreadsheet` (Excel export logic).
*   **`src\store\fretures\analytics-slice.ts`**:
    *   This Redux slice (4:01:14 PM) manages the state specific to the analytics feature, including endpoints, metrics data, date filters, selected dashboards, and loading status.
    *   An import path for `dateFilterHandle` was corrected (4:02:19 PM) to align with utility file reorganization.
*   **`src\utils\utils.ts`**:
    *   This general utility file (4:02:02 PM) was added to consolidate common helper functions such as `appDateFormat`, `parseRawString`, `useDateFormate` (for user-preference-based date formatting), and `dateFilterHandle` (for generating various date ranges).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The development timeline shows concentrated efforts on October 23, 2025, starting with initial routing for analytics (3:20 PM), followed by the creation of core analytics components (`AnalyticsScreen`, `MetricsBox`, `AnalyticsContainer`, `ResizableGridItem`) between 3:21 PM and 3:30 PM. The Redux Toolkit Query API slice for analytics (`analytics-api.ts`) was set up around 3:39 PM, with a crucial update to cache invalidation tags at 3:40 PM. The Redux store (`store.ts`) was updated to include analytics by 3:44 PM. Later, configuration (`config/analytics.ts`, 3:52 PM), analytics-specific utilities (`methods.ts`, 3:58 PM), the Redux analytics state slice (`analytics-slice.ts`, 4:01 PM), and general utilities (`utils.ts`, 4:02 PM) were added, demonstrating a structured rollout of the feature.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature-Driven Development:** The entire log reflects the sequential development and integration of a new "Analytics" feature.
*   **Redux Toolkit & RTK Query:** Redux Toolkit is consistently used for state management, and RTK Query is the chosen method for all API interactions related to analytics, demonstrating a strong adoption of these technologies.
*   **Modular Component Architecture:** The feature is broken down into highly specialized and reusable React components, following a clear hierarchy (e.g., `AnalyticsScreen` > `AnalyticsContainer` > `ResizableGridItem` > `MetricsBox`).
*   **Import Path Refactoring:** A recurring pattern is the adjustment and standardization of import paths, moving from relative to absolute or aliased paths, suggesting an ongoing effort to improve code organization and maintainability.
*   **Interactive Dashboard Elements:** The inclusion of `react-dnd` and `react-resizable` highlights a focus on providing users with a highly interactive and customizable analytics dashboard experience.
*   **Utility Consolidation:** The creation of `methods.ts` and `utils.ts` indicates a strategy to centralize common logic, such as data processing, date handling, and Excel exports, promoting reusability and reducing redundancy.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** The conversion of `.jsx` files to `.tsx` and the addition of explicit type imports show an ongoing commitment to leveraging TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability, despite some potential mis-typings observed.
*   **Frequent Saves:** Multiple entries for the same file with identical content suggest a development workflow that involves frequent saving or minor non-functional changes.

## 9:35:59 AM
The provided log details a concentrated development effort between October 22-23, 2025, focused primarily on building out an analytics module within the `t360-backend-v2` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/22/2025, 12:19:46 PM
    *   **Key Update:** A significant expansion of the `Analytics` section was introduced, adding new base paths and specific endpoints for getting, creating, updating, and deleting dashboards/views, fetching dashboard endpoints, metrics lists, Excel reports, saving sequences, and sizes (`Get`, `Create`, `Update`, `DeleteView`, `DashboardEndPoints`, `MetricsList`, `GetExcelReport`, `SaveSequence`, `SaveSize`, `GetCbm`, `GetKgs`, `GetTeu`, `GetContainers`, `GetTransit`, `GetTablesData`).

*   **`src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **Initial Setup (10/22/2025, 12:20:38 PM):** The `AnalyticsRoutes` were initially configured to serve dashboard card and delivery information from `dashboardService`, which was later changed.
    *   **Major Refactor (10/22/2025, 12:33:16 PM):** The route definitions were significantly revised to use `getAll` from the newly introduced `coreViewService` for the `Paths.Analytics.Get` endpoint.
    *   **Expansion (10/22/2025, 12:34:42 PM - 4:38:37 PM):** Routes for `Create`, `Update`, `DeleteView` (from `coreViewService`), `DashboardEndPoints`, `MetricsList`, `SaveSequence`, and `SaveSize` (from `coreMetricService`) were progressively added and correctly mapped to their respective service functions. The `GetExcelReport` route was also mapped to `getExportData` from `analyticsExportService`. Some `Get` endpoints remained as placeholders for `getAll` from `coreViewService`.

*   **`src\routes\index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/22/2025, 12:21:23 PM
    *   **Key Update:** The `AnalyticsRoutes` were integrated into the main API router, enabling access to the new analytics features.

*   **`src\services\coreViewService.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 12:26:53 PM):** This new service was created to manage user-specific dashboard views, including `getAll`, `create`, `update`, and `deleteView` functionalities. It also introduced `logAudit` for tracking these actions in an `analytics_view_log` table.
    *   **Refinements (10/22/2025, 12:31:11 PM - 12:46:12 PM):** Imports were updated for better type safety (`IAuthReq`, `Response`, `NextFunction`, `CheckBoxDetails`), function signatures were adjusted, and optional chaining (`user?.usercode`) was added for robustness. A significant security enhancement was made by switching SQL `INSERT` and `UPDATE` queries to use parameterized queries (`$1, $2, $3::int[]`) instead of string interpolation for sensitive data like `dashboard_metrics` and `user_id`, mitigating SQL injection risks.

*   **`src\services\coreMetricService.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:11:45 PM):** Introduced `dashboardEndPointList` to fetch and sort dashboard metrics and their display properties (row/column span).
    *   **Expansion (10/22/2025, 4:17:27 PM - 4:38:20 PM):**
        *   `getMetricList` was added to retrieve and categorize available metrics (`Container_Wise`, `MBL_Wise`) and optionally preload their selection status for a given dashboard.
        *   `saveSequence` was implemented to store the order of reports in a dashboard, including logic for a "Default" dashboard.
        *   `saveSize` was added to store layout information (columnSpan, rowSpan) for individual reports within a dashboard.
        *   Improvements were made to type safety with explicit type guards and nullish coalescing operators.

*   **`src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:40:11 PM):** Introduced `getExportData` for generating report export files. This service dynamically constructs SQL queries based on various parameters (date range, report name, booking status, columns, display options), applies date filtering, and includes specific column value replacements (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES").
    *   **Refactoring (10/22/2025, 4:47:46 PM):** Imports were updated to use `@src` aliases, `IAuthReq` was adopted for request types, and `userCode` handling for `saveColumns` was made more robust.
    *   **Minor Inconsistency (10/22/2025, 6:08:54 PM):** The import for `nonBookingQuery` was removed, despite the function still being called in the service logic, indicating a potential oversight or a related unlogged change in `export.query.ts`.

*   **`src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:43:56 PM):** A utility file for analytics was created, containing helpers such as `defaultDateRange`, `replaceValueInQuery` (for SQL column transformation), `getUserObject` (for user context), `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` (for SQL aggregation), `getExcelSelectedColumns` (for dynamic column selection), `isValidDate`, `dateFilterOnExport` (for date formatting), and `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` (a list of default export columns).
    *   **Type Safety (10/22/2025, 5:09:52 PM):** Type interfaces (`User`, `UserRow`, `DataItem`) and explicit return types were added to functions, enhancing code predictability and error detection.

*   **`src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Initial Creation (10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM):** This utility file was created to house complex, dynamically generated SQL query fragments specific to various analytics reports. It includes `getMonthValue` for date conversion and a large `bookingQuery` function that branches logic based on report names and display parameters.

*   **`src\models\common\types\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Progressive Definition (10/22/2025, 12:27:34 PM - 4:36:01 PM):** This file saw continuous additions and refinements of interfaces to support the analytics module:
        *   `CheckBoxDetails`: For metrics selection.
        *   `MenuRow`: For dashboard titles, later expanded to include `metricsId`, `dashboard_metrics`, and `size`.
        *   `DashboardItem`: For individual metric components within a dashboard, later adding `dashboard_name`.
        *   `MetricListDataI`: For the comprehensive list of metrics with grouping and filtering.
        *   `MetricRow`: For basic metric ID and name.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/22/2025, 12:19:46 PM:** Initial definition of analytics paths.
*   **10/22/2025, 12:26:53 PM:** Creation of `coreViewService` for dashboard management.

*   **10/22/2025, 4:11:45 PM:** Creation of `coreMetricService` for dashboard metric endpoints and ordering.
*   **10/22/2025, 4:40:11 PM:** Creation of `analyticsExportService` for report generation.
*   **10/22/2025, 4:43:56 PM:** Creation of `analytics.ts` utility file.
*   **10/22/2025, 4:46:51 PM:** Creation of `export.query.ts` with complex SQL query definitions.
*   **10/22/2025, 5:09:52 PM:** Major type safety improvements in `analytics.ts`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics Module Focus:** The overarching pattern is the rapid development and modularization of an analytics system, including view management, metric configuration, and data export.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** Most significant changes occurred on October 22, 2025, indicating an intensive single-day development push, with minor updates continuing into October 23, 2025.
*   **Database Interactions:** All services heavily rely on a `query` function (likely a PostgreSQL client) to interact with various database tables (`dashboards`, `metrics`, `mtr_tracking_data`, `agent_booking_entry`, `analytics_view_log`, `mtr_user_master`).
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** There's a clear trend towards improving type safety by introducing explicit interfaces for data structures and using type assertions and guards throughout the codebase.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Consistent use of `try-catch` blocks with `logger.error` for robust error management across API endpoints and service functions.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation:** Complex SQL queries are frequently constructed dynamically based on user input, report types, and date ranges, particularly for export functionalities. This pattern initially involved string interpolation but later shifted to parameterized queries for improved security in `coreViewService`.
*   **User Context and Authorization:** The `getUserObject` utility and `IAuthReq` interface highlight the importance of managing user and company-specific data access.
*   **Modularization:** The code is structured into distinct services (`coreViewService`, `coreMetricService`, `analyticsExportService`) and utilities (`analytics.ts`, `export.query.ts`) reflecting a clear separation of concerns.
