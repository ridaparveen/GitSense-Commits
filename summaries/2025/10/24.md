# Activity Summary for 10/24/2025

## 9:35:11 AM
The provided log entry details the `AnalyticsScreen.jsx` file as of **10/23/2025, 3:18:36 PM**. This file represents the main screen for the analytics feature in the `t360-frontend` application.

**File-Specific Updates (`AnalyticsScreen.jsx`):**

This component serves as the orchestrator for displaying analytics data. Its key functionalities include:

*   **State Management:** It heavily utilizes Redux, accessing global state for `analytics` (`mainState`), `settings` (`settingsState`), and `auth.user`. It dispatches actions to update `analyticsSlice` with fetched data, loading states, and selected customer information.
*   **Data Fetching with RTK Query:** The screen integrates Redux Toolkit Query for efficient data fetching:
    *   `useFetchDashboardsQuery`: Fetches available dashboards based on the user's company and role upon component mount.
    *   `useLazyFetchEndpointsQuery`: Lazily fetches specific analytics endpoints (e.g., list of reports) based on the `selectedDashboard`.
    *   `useLazyFetchReportQuery`: Lazily fetches individual reports based on the determined endpoints.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard and Report Loading:**
    *   An `useEffect` hook initializes the dashboard state with `dashboardViews` once successfully fetched.
    *   A primary `useEffect` handles the core data fetching logic:
        *   It determines whether to use `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` or fetch custom endpoints based on `mainState.selectedDashobard`.
        *   It then proceeds to fetch all associated reports concurrently using `Promise.all`, applying an initial date range (`year_2_date`) and formatting dates with `moment`. Each report query includes parameters like `apiKey`, `reportName`, `userid`, date range, `displayBy`, `viewBy`, `companyname`, and `access`.
        *   Fetched data is processed by `metricsPackageHandler` and dispatched to the Redux store.
        *   Loading states are managed, showing a `Loader` during data fetching.
*   **User Role-Based Logic:**
    *   If the user's `role` is 'CUSTOMER', their `companyname` is automatically set as the `selectedCustomer`.
    *   The UI displays an `Alert` for 'ADMIN' users if no customer is selected.
*   **UI Structure:** The screen incorporates common UI components like `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedBreadcrumb`, and `AnalyticsToolbar`. The core analytics content is rendered within `AnalyticsContainer`, conditional on loading state and customer selection.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux-Centric Architecture:** Frequent use of `useSelector` to retrieve data from the Redux store and `useDispatch` to trigger state updates, demonstrating a strong reliance on Redux for application state management.
*   **API Query Patterns:** API calls through RTK Query consistently include `companyname`, `access`, and `userid` in their query parameters, indicating a pattern of multi-tenancy or role-based access control for analytics data.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The component makes extensive use of conditional rendering based on `isLoading` states, `user.role`, and the presence of `selectedCustomer` to manage the user experience.
*   **Asynchronous Data Flow:** Multiple `useEffect` hooks and `async/await` patterns are employed to manage the sequential and concurrent fetching of different data sets (dashboards, endpoints, reports), ensuring data dependencies are met.
*   **Utility Functions:** Integration of utility functions like `dateFilterHandle` and `metricsPackageHandler` suggests a modular approach to handling common data manipulation and formatting tasks.

The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\analytics.route.ts` was updated on `10/22/2025, 11:01:53 AM`.

This file, an Express router, defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints for an analytics module. Key updates include:

*   **Dashboard Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are exposed for `/dashboards` endpoints, handled by `core.view.controller`.
*   **Metric and Endpoint Discovery:** Endpoints `/dashboardEndPoints` and `/metricsList` are added to retrieve lists of available dashboard endpoints and metrics, respectively, managed by `core.metric.controller`.
*   **User Preferences:** New POST routes `/save_sequence` and `/save_size` are introduced for saving user-specific preferences related to analytics views or data presentation.
*   **Reporting Endpoints:** Multiple dedicated GET endpoints are added for various types of reports, including `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and `/Tables/tableData`, each leveraging specific controllers (`cbm.controller`, `kgs.controller`, `teu.controller`, `container.controller`, `transit.controller`, `others.controller`).
*   **Data Export:** An endpoint `/excelExport` is added to facilitate data export functionality, handled by `core.export.controller`.

The changes reflect an expansion of the analytics module, introducing more granular control over dashboards, extensive reporting capabilities, and mechanisms for user preferences and data export. The pattern observed is the modular organization of analytics functionalities, with each major feature area (views, metrics, specific report types, export) managed by its own dedicated controller imported into this central route definition file.
