# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

## 10:46:42 AM
The provided log details a series of focused updates to a frontend application related to an "ISF Dashboard" feature, all occurring on October 7, 2025, between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:43:45 AM)**
    *   This file, which defines the column structure for the ISF Dashboard, underwent significant refactoring and expansion.
    *   Many new Material-UI icons (`AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) were imported, indicating a shift towards more visual status indicators.
    *   `minWidth` properties were added to most columns (`agent_booking_id`, `mbl_bl_no`, `etd`, `importer_name`, `isf_status`, `xml_sent_date`, `batch_created_by`, `transaction_id`, `cbp_status`, `cbp_errors`, `remarks`, `cng_xml_sent_date`, `location`, `lastmodifieddate`).
    *   The `isf_status` column was updated to render a `Chip` component, color-coded based on the status (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`) and displaying an `AdjustOutlinedIcon`.
    *   The `cbp_status` column also adopted a `Chip` renderer, using `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon` for 'Accepted' and `ErrorOutlineIcon` for 'ERROR', with corresponding color-coding.
    *   The `remarks` column, representing 'BOL Status', was enhanced to display a color-coded `Chip` with a `TagOutlinedIcon`, formatting "NO BILL MATCH (NOT ON FILE)" to "NOT MATCHED".
    *   New columns were introduced for 'CNG ISF Sent Date' (`cng_xml_sent_date`), 'Origin Office' (`location`), and 'Last Modified Date' (`lastmodifieddate`), all utilizing `appDateFormat` for display.
    *   The 'Action' column was moved to the end of the column definitions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:45:03 AM)**
    *   A minor but notable change in this subsequent update to the same file.
    *   The `mbl_bl_no` column's `headerName` was changed from '12 #' to 'Bill of Lading #'.
    *   The 'Action' column, which was at the end in the previous version, was moved to the very beginning of the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:46:20 AM)**
    *   This component, responsible for the ISF Dashboard user interface, received functional and UI enhancements.
    *   A `useEffect` hook was added to automatically `refetch` dashboard data if a `redirectState` indicates a 'saved' operation, suggesting integration with a save-and-redirect workflow.
    *   The `renderCell` property for the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` (specifically the 'Action' column, which was moved to the start) was dynamically set to `GridActions`, providing interactive actions defined by `getISFActions`.
    *   A refresh button (`IconButton` with `CachedIcon`) was added to the `CardHeader`, allowing users to manually refresh the dashboard data.
    *   The `ThemedGrid` component now includes `rowHeight={40}` and disables column menu and sorting features (`disableColumnMenu`, `disableColumnSorting`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Unified Development Session:** All changes were logged within a three-minute window on the same date, indicating a concentrated effort on the ISF Dashboard feature.
*   **Emphasis on UI/UX:** Extensive use of Material-UI components (Chips, Icons, Box, Stack, Card) and specific styling properties (`minWidth`, `color`, `variant`) points to a strong focus on improving the visual presentation and user experience of the dashboard.
*   **Visual Status Representation:** A consistent pattern of using `Chip` components with color-coding and relevant icons (e.g., `AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) is applied across multiple columns to clearly convey statuses like ISF status, CBP response, and BOL status.
*   **Date Formatting Consistency:** The `appDateFormat` utility is repeatedly used for displaying date fields across various columns, ensuring a uniform date format throughout the dashboard.
*   **Data Grid Enhancements:** The `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array is central to the data display, and its continuous refinement, along with the `ThemedGrid` props, demonstrates ongoing work on the dashboard's table functionality.
*   **State Management and Data Fetching:** The use of `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and `RTK Query` (`useFetchIsfDashboardQuery`, `refetch`) indicates a modern and centralized approach to application state and data fetching.

## 11:41:58 AM
The `get_auto_complete.controller.ts` file saw multiple updates within a short period, focusing on refining autocomplete search functionality. Initially, at 10/7/2025, 10:56:40 AM, it provided a broad range of autocomplete options for fields like `salesname`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shipper`, `agent`, `port`, `booking-shipper`, `scac`, `customer`, `getsku`, and `getVendor`. A key observation in this initial version was the construction of SQL queries for `booking-shipper`, which used `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '$1%'`, potentially indicating an incorrect parameterized query format or a direct string interpolation leading to a vulnerability. Search keywords for `booking-shipper` and `port` were wrapped with leading and trailing `%` wildcards.

The update at 10/7/2025, 10:59:16 AM, specifically addressed the `booking-shipper` search. The `search` variable's wildcard application was changed from `%${req.query.search}%` to `${req.query.search}%`, meaning the search became prefix-based (`LIKE term%` instead of `LIKE %term%`). Crucially, the corresponding SQL query was corrected to `LOWER(am.cname) ilike $1`, properly utilizing the parameterized query syntax and resolving the earlier potential vulnerability or misuse.

A subsequent change at 10/7/2025, 11:00:37 AM, applied a similar refinement to the `port` autocomplete search. Its `search` variable was also adjusted to use only a trailing wildcard (`${Searchquery.toLowerCase()}%`), shifting its behavior to prefix matching like the `booking-shipper` field. Throughout these changes to `get_auto_complete.controller.ts`, the `getVendor` case consistently appeared incomplete, ending abruptly.

At 10/7/2025, 11:10:26 AM, a new file, `isf.controller.ts`, was introduced, signifying a major new feature related to Importer Security Filing (ISF) management. This controller is responsible for handling ISF-related data. It defines a comprehensive list of fields for the `agent_booking_entry` table, indicating a complex data structure. Key functionalities include:
*   `fetchEdiPayload`: Retrieves detailed ISF data, including vessel, commodity, and routing information, processing dates for validity.
*   `createEdit`: Manages the creation and updating of ISF entries. This function incorporates robust transaction management (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), comprehensive auditing (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`), and handles associated data for vessels, routing, and commodity lists. It also checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` to maintain the correct `isf_status` during updates and supports a `draftFlag`.
*   `createDescXml`: Generates ISF XML descriptions, including checks to prevent re-sending already processed XML and utilizing an `isfXmlGenerator` utility.
*   `uploadDescXml`: Appears to be an incomplete function intended for uploading ISF XML.

Across both files, common patterns observed are extensive database interaction using `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions, and consistent error handling practices leveraging `try...catch` blocks that return `500 Internal server error` responses or utilize an `HttpError` module with `next()` for middleware error handling in the ISF controller. Logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`, `logger.warn`) is also frequently used for debugging and tracking execution flow.

## 11:46:45 AM
The log details changes made to several files related to an "ISF Dashboard" in a frontend application, specifically focusing on filtering and search functionalities. The changes span from `10/7/2025, 10:47:15 AM` to `10/7/2025, 11:41:26 AM`.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx`
- **10/7/2025, 10:47:15 AM**: This update to the `ISFDashboardScreen` component primarily involved the dashboard's query parameters. It expanded the `useFetchIsfDashboardQuery` to include various filtering criteria such as `batch_created_by`, `cbp_status`, `importer_name`, `ship_name`, `origin_office`, and `orderBy` (supporting both `sortModel` and `sortBy`). It also introduced an `useEffect` hook to refetch data when a `redirectState.operation` is 'saved'. The component's rendering of `GridActions` was adjusted to target the last column.
- **10/7/2025, 10:49:32 AM**: A minor but significant change was made here. The `GridActions` rendering was changed from targeting `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS.length - 1]` (the last column) to `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[0]` (the first column).

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashFilter.jsx`
- **10/7/2025, 11:02:59 AM**: This file was updated to define and manage filter categories for the ISF dashboard. It uses `react-redux` to access selected filters and dispatch actions (`toggleISFDashboardFilter`). A `filterConfig` array was introduced to dynamically render `FilterChipGroup` components for various categories like 'CBP Status', 'Office Origin', 'Fillers', 'Importers', and 'Shippers', mapping their options from `filterInfo`. It also imports and renders `ISFSearchForm`.

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`
This file saw the most frequent changes, primarily focused on enhancing the search form's input fields and dynamic option handling.
- **10/7/2025, 11:03:17 AM**: Initial setup of `ISFSearchForm` using `formik` for state management and `react-redux` for dispatching updates to `ISFDashboardInput`. It includes input boxes for 'MBL#12', 'BL#', 'SCAC', 'HTS#', along with 'reset' and 'apply' buttons.
- **10/7/2025, 11:03:27 AM**: Corrected a typo in an `InputBox` label from "MBL#12" to "MBL#".
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:24 AM**: Introduced new input fields for "Shipper", "Importer#", and "Delivery To #", expanding the search capabilities. The `id` attributes for "Shipper" and "Delivery To #" were incorrectly set to "scac" and "hts_no" respectively, overlapping with existing fields.
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:39 AM**: Adjusted the spacing for the "Delivery To #" input field by changing the parent `Stack`'s spacing prop from `3` to `2`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:51 AM**: Changed the "Delivery To #" input to be rendered directly within the main vertical `Stack` rather than an enclosed `Stack` with spacing.
- **10/7/2025, 11:05:22 AM**: Moved the "Delivery To #" input field to the bottom `Stack` alongside the 'reset' and 'apply' buttons.
- **10/7/2025, 11:05:53 AM**: Added a `className="w-full"` to the "Delivery To #" `InputBox`, likely for styling purposes.
- **10/7/2025, 11:06:05 AM**: Changed the `className` of the "Delivery To #" `InputBox` from "w-full" to "100px", indicating a size adjustment.
- **10/7/2025, 11:11:07 AM**: Expanded the `formik` `initialValues` and `handleReset` to include new fields: `ship_name`, `importer_name`, and `delivery_to_no`. However, the corresponding input boxes still use `scac` and `hts_no` as `id`s for these new labels.
- **10/7/2025, 11:15:13 AM**: Significant refactoring:
    - Introduced `useState` for `options` and `ApiManager` for fetching data.
    - Added `AppAutocomplete` component for "Supplier Name" (labeled as "Shipper Name" in later logs), allowing dynamic search for shippers via `handleOptionChange` and `handleValueChange` functions.
    - `handleOptionChange` fetches common options for "booking-shipper" from an API.
    - `handleValueChange` updates various `formik` fields (`ship_code`, `ship_add1`, etc.) based on the selected shipper.
- **10/7/2025, 11:18:43 AM**: Modified the `onChange` handler for `AppAutocomplete` to use `event.target.value` instead of the directly passed `value`, which suggests a change in how the `AppAutocomplete` component's `onChange` event is structured or interpreted.
- **10/7/2025, 11:21:06 AM**: Reverted the `AppAutocomplete` `onChange` handler to use `value?.cname || ''`, indicating the `AppAutocomplete` likely returns an object with a `cname` property for display. This correction fixes the previous change.
- **10/7/2025, 11:22:19 AM**: Refined the `AppAutocomplete` `onChange` handler to use `value?.cname || ''` specifically, ensuring the correct property is set in formik.
- **10/7/2025, 11:23:15 AM**: Changed the label of the `AppAutocomplete` from "Supplier Name" to "Shipper Name".
- **10/7/2025, 11:24:15 AM**: Added a `console.log("inputs====",inputs);` statement for debugging.
- **10/7/2025, 11:25:46 AM**: Modified `formik` `initialValues` to use `shipper` and `importer` as keys instead of `ship_name` and `importer_name`, though the actual input fields still reference the `ship_name` property. This indicates a potential mismatch or a change in naming convention that isn't fully propagated.
- **10/7/2025, 11:32:49 AM**: Major refactoring for state management of options:
    - Replaced `useState` for `options` with `useReducer` to manage various lists of options (e.g., `pol`, `pod`, `shipper`, `importer`).
    - The `dispatch` for `useReducer` is named `dispatch` in this version, which shadows the `useDispatch()` from `react-redux`.
    - The `handleOptionChange` now uses this `useReducer`'s `dispatch` to update specific option categories like `shipper`.
    - The `AppAutocomplete` options now correctly map `options.shipper`.
    - Commented out the original `handleOptionChange` using `useState`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:34:04 AM** / **10/7/2025, 11:34:11 AM** / **10/7/2025, 11:35:04 AM**: These entries show minimal changes, primarily related to `console.log` for debugging and slight re-indentation, but the core logic introduced at `11:32:49 AM` remains. The `useReducer` `dispatch` is still named `dispatch` here, which is problematic.
- **10/7/2025, 11:35:27 AM**: Added `console.log("options===",options)` for debugging the `useReducer` state.
- **10/7/2025, 11:37:20 AM**: Corrected the shadowing issue by explicitly naming the `useReducer`'s dispatch as `localDispatch` in the `useState` destructuring, however, it still uses `dispatch` for `useReducer`. This is still incorrect as `dispatch` is already taken by `useDispatch()`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:39:11 AM**: Further refined `useReducer` by removing unnecessary initial state fields, keeping only `shipper`, `importer`, and `consignee`. The `useReducer`'s dispatch is still ambiguously named `dispatch`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:41:26 AM**: Finally resolved the `dispatch` naming conflict by renaming the `useReducer`'s dispatch function to `localDispatch`. This ensures that `dispatch` refers to the Redux store dispatch, and `localDispatch` refers to the reducer's dispatch.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
- **Redux Integration**: The application heavily relies on `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management, particularly for ISF Dashboard data, pagination, sorting, and filter inputs.
- **Form Management**: `formik` is consistently used in `ISFSearchForm.jsx` for handling form state, input changes, and submission.
- **UI Components**: `@mui/material` components (Box, Card, Stack, IconButton, Button, InputBox, SelectBox) are widely used for building the user interface. Custom components like `ThemedBreadcrumb`, `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedGrid`, `GridSearchInput`, `FilterChipGroup`, and `AppAutocomplete` indicate a consistent component library approach.
- **API Interaction**: `ApiManager` is used for fetching data, specifically `getCommonOptions` for autocomplete functionalities.
- **Filtering and Search**: A significant focus is on implementing robust filtering and search mechanisms for the ISF Dashboard, including text inputs, dropdowns, and chip-based filters.
- **Debugging Statements**: Frequent `console.log` statements for `redirectState`, `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS.length`, `values` in `onSubmit`, `inputs`, and `options` indicate active development and debugging.
- **State Management Refinement**: There's a clear evolution in how dynamic options for autocomplete are managed, moving from simple `useState` to a more structured `useReducer` pattern to handle multiple categories of options. The naming of dispatch functions for `useReducer` was a recurring correction point.
- **Timestamp Pattern**: All changes occur on `10/7/2025`, indicating concentrated development effort on this specific feature within a single day. The timestamps are sequential and relatively close, suggesting iterative development and rapid bug fixing.

## 12:41:54 PM
The `BMQuery.ts` utility file, updated at **10/7/2025, 12:21:12 PM**, introduces a `BMQuery` class designed to generate SQL `SELECT` statements for retrieving various types of business partners. Each method (e.g., `getBuyer`, `getSeller`, `getImporter`, `getManufacturer`, `getConsignee`, `getBondHolder`, `getCustomBroker`) constructs a query targeting `agent_po_account_master` and `agent_po_account_master_type` tables. A recurring pattern across these queries is the use of `DISTINCT ON (am.cname)`, filtering by specific `atype` values, and performing a case-insensitive partial match on `am.cname` using `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '${this.keyword}%'`. Some queries also include additional joins or conditions, such as checking `cname` in `po_accountmaster_customer_master` or `account_master_shipper_map`.

The `isf.controller.ts` file saw significant changes at **10/7/2025, 12:30:44 PM** and **10/7/2025, 12:31:35 PM** (the latter being a duplicate entry of the former). These updates introduced a comprehensive list of fields for ISF (Importer Security Filing) data, including detailed address information for various parties, booking details, and new identification fields like `cnee_id_type`, `cnee_id_no`, `bond_holder_id_type`, `bond_holder_id_no`, `importer_id_type`, and `importer_id_no`. The `fetchEdiPayload` function was enhanced to retrieve consolidated ISF data, vessel information (handling mother/feeder vessels), commodity lists, and routing details. The `createEdit` function was refactored to support both creation and updates of ISF records within a transactional context, including audit logging, dynamic status updates (DRAFT, NEW, CREATED) based on existing `cng_xml_batchlog` entries, and management of associated vessel, routing, and commodity list data. The `createDescXml` function was also updated with checks to prevent duplicate XML generation if an ISF record is already marked as "Sent" or "Created."

Concurrently, the `isf.types.ts` file was updated at **10/7/2025, 12:30:54 PM** to define new and refined TypeScript types and interfaces crucial for ISF data. This includes `DataInput` with expanded fields for importer and shipment details, `Address` and `TempData` types that now incorporate `id_value`, `id_type`, and bond-related information. A new `ISFQueryType` interface was added for defining query parameters, and two key enums, `ISFStatus` (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`) and `ISFCNGStatus` (`NOT_SENT`, `SENT_TO_CNG`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`), were introduced to standardize and manage the lifecycle and communication status of ISF filings.

Overall, the changes highlight a concentrated effort to build out and refine the ISF functionality within the application. This includes robust data management, complex query generation, comprehensive status tracking, and audit logging. The proximity of the timestamps suggests these changes were part of a single, focused development push.

## 12:47:25 PM
The provided log details changes across two files related to an ISF (Importer Security Filing) dashboard in a React frontend application: `ISFSearchForm.jsx` and `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`.

### File: `src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`

This file handles the search form functionality for the ISF dashboard, integrating with Redux for state management and Formik for form handling.

*   **10/7/2025, 11:50:30 AM**: The initial state of the component includes basic input fields (MBL#, BL#, SCAC, HTS#) and an `AppAutocomplete` for "Shipper Name." A `useReducer` manages options for `shipper`, `importer`, and `consignee`. The `handleOptionChange` function was initially designed to fetch only "booking-shipper" options. A `handleValueChange` function was present to populate shipper details based on selection.
*   **10/7/2025, 11:51:16 AM**: An `AppAutocomplete` for "Importer Name" was added to the UI. However, its `handleOptionChange` callback still incorrectly pointed to the shipper-specific logic, implying it would attempt to fetch shipper data instead of importer data.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:01:16 PM**:
    *   The `BookingAtypeEnum` was imported, signaling an intent to generalize API endpoints.
    *   A significant refactoring attempt was made in `handleOptionChange` to use conditional logic (`if(shipper)`, `else if(importer)`, `else if(consignee)`) to determine the API endpoint dynamically. Critically, the variables `shipper`, `importer`, `consignee` inside this function were incorrectly assigned the return value of `localDispatch` (which is `undefined`), leading to a logical flaw where the conditional blocks would not execute as intended.
    *   The "Delivery To #" `InputBox` was replaced with an `AppAutocomplete` for "Delivery To," aimed at fetching consignee data (though still affected by the `handleOptionChange` bug).
*   **10/7/2025, 12:02:21 PM**: A minor bug fix was applied in `handleOptionChange`, adding nullish coalescing (`res?.data?.length`) to safely access nested properties, preventing potential runtime errors. The core logical flaw in determining the endpoint persisted.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:04:14 PM**:
    *   A major fix was implemented for `handleOptionChange`. It was updated to accept `field` as an argument (`async (field, query) => {...}`), correctly determining the API endpoint (`"booking-shipper"`, `BookingAtypeEnum.IMPORTER`, `BookingAtypeEnum.CONSIGNEE`) based on this `field`.
    *   The `AppAutocomplete` for "Shipper Name" was updated to correctly pass `"shipper"` as the `field` argument. However, "Importer Name" and "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` components were not yet updated to pass their respective `field` arguments, still using the generic `handleOptionChange(query)`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:05:34 PM**: Robustness improvements were added to `handleOptionChange`:
    *   A check `if (!query) return;` prevents API calls with empty queries.
    *   `.trim()` was added to the `searchQuery`.
    *   A `try...catch` block was wrapped around the `ApiManager.getCommonOptions` call for error handling.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:22:56 PM**: The `AppAutocomplete` components for "Importer Name" and "Delivery To" were finally updated to correctly pass their `field` arguments (`"importer"` and `"consignee"` respectively) to the `handleOptionChange` function, completing the generalization.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:24:11 PM**: An unused import `WidthFull` from `@mui/icons-material` was added. An incorrect styling attempt was made on the "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` using `WidthFull` in its `sx` prop.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:24:41 PM**: The styling for "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` was adjusted, changing `WidthFull` to `WidthFull: "100%"`, still an unconventional MUI styling approach.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:26:02 PM**: Styling for "Shipper Name" and "Importer Name" `AppAutocomplete` components was updated to use MUI's `mt`, `mb` spacing shorthands and `flex: 1` for equal width distribution within their `Stack`. The "Delivery To" field retained its `WidthFull: "100%"` style.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:26:25 PM**: The "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` styling was made consistent with the other autocomplete fields by changing its `sx` prop to `sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 1, flex: 1 }}`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:26:46 PM**: The `flex` property for "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` was changed from `flex: 1` to `flex: 2`. Given its placement, this might lead to unintended layout behavior.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:30:13 PM**: The `handleReset` function's `updateISFDashboardInput` payload was cleaned up, removing `delivery_to_no: ""`. The `handleValueChange` function, which was unused, was removed.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:35:07 PM**: Further code cleanup occurred with the removal of the unused `useState` import and the previously unused `WidthFull` import.

**Patterns in `ISFSearchForm.jsx`**: A clear iterative development process is observed, starting with basic functionality, then gradually generalizing and fixing the autocomplete logic for different entity types (shipper, importer, consignee). This involved several steps to correctly pass parameters and handle API calls, followed by styling refinements and general code cleanup.

### File: `src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`

This file is responsible for the header section of the ISF dashboard, including search, filters, and display of ISF templates.

*   **10/7/2025, 12:37:47 PM**: The component structure includes a `ScreenToolbar` with a text field for "Bill of Lading" search and `SelectBox` components for "Shipper" and "Importer" filters. It fetches ISF templates using `useGetTemplateQuery` and displays them as `BoxItem` components, including a "New ISF" option. Filtering logic for `filteredData`, `uniqueShippers`, and `uniqueImporters` is implemented using `useMemo`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:38:01 PM**: A minor textual change was made: `title="New ISF1"` was updated to `title="New ISF"` for the "New ISF" template box.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:38:24 PM**: A typo was corrected in the "New ISF" template box's subtitle, changing `subtitle="Create from scratch"ddd` to `subtitle="Create from scratch"`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:38:39 PM**: No functional changes. The code is identical to the previous entry, likely an automatic save.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:40:42 PM**: A minor textual change was made within the `BoxItem` component, changing the shipper label from `Shipper:` to `Shipper:1`. This appears to be a small placeholder or debugging change.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:40:56 PM**: No functional changes. The code is identical to the previous entry, likely an automatic save.

**Patterns in `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`**: The changes in this file are predominantly minor textual adjustments and typo corrections within the display elements. There are no significant functional or structural updates beyond the initial implementation shown. Multiple consecutive entries are identical, indicating frequent, possibly automated, saves without code modification.

## 2:42:03 PM
The provided log details changes primarily affecting the Importer Security Filing (ISF) functionality within the T360 API backend, specifically within its controller and routing layers.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf.controller.ts`**:
    *   **Initial state (10/7/2025, 1:53:25 PM):** This file contains a comprehensive implementation for managing ISF data. It defines a large array of `fields` for the `agent_booking_entry` table.
        *   The `fetchEdiPayload` function is responsible for retrieving detailed ISF data, including general entry information, vessel details (distinguishing between mother and feeder vessels), HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) commodity lists, and routing information. It also performs date validation.
        *   The `createEdit` function handles both creating new ISF entries and updating existing ones. It utilizes database transactions (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`), performs audit logging, manages ISF statuses (DRAFT, NEW, CREATED), and updates related tables like `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_routing`, and `isf_commodity_list`. New booking IDs are generated for new entries.
        *   The `createDescXml` function is designed to generate an ISF XML description, checking for existing records and preventing re-creation if already sent.
        *   An `uploadDescXml` function is also present, though its full implementation isn't shown in the provided snippet.
    *   **Later update (10/7/2025, 2:27:20 PM):** A significant addition was made to the `fetchEdiPayload` function. It now includes a query to retrieve `isf_templates` associated with the `agent_booking_id` and adds this `templateList` to the response data. This indicates an enhancement to integrate template management directly with ISF data retrieval.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\isf.route.ts`**:
    *   **Initial state (10/7/2025, 1:54:49 PM):** This file establishes all the API endpoints for the ISF module. It defines routes for fetching, creating/editing, generating and uploading XML, and basic template management (add, update, get).
    *   **Later update (10/7/2025, 2:02:56 PM):** The `PUT /template/update` route was modified to include a `:serial_id` path parameter (`router.put("/template/update/:serial_id", ...)`). This change suggests that template updates now target a specific template identified by its `serial_id` in the URL.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/7/2025, 1:53:25 PM:** Initial detailed code for `isf.controller.ts`, establishing core ISF management logic including data fetching, creation/update, and XML generation.
*   **10/7/2025, 1:54:49 PM:** Initial setup of ISF API routes in `isf.route.ts`, enabling various operations, including template management.
*   **10/7/2025, 2:02:56 PM:** Update to `isf.route.ts` to modify the `updateTemplate` endpoint to accept a `serial_id` as a URL parameter, indicating a more specific way to update templates.
*   **10/7/2025, 2:27:20 PM:** Update to `isf.controller.ts` to enhance the `fetchEdiPayload` by including `isf_templates` data in the response, suggesting improved integration with template functionality.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database Interaction:** Both files extensively interact with a PostgreSQL database (implied by `insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`, and syntax like `$1`) for various ISF-related tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_routing`, `isf_commodity_list`, `isf_templates`, `cng_xml_batchlog`).
*   **`agent_booking_id` as a Central Identifier:** This ID is consistently used across multiple queries and operations to link related ISF data.
*   **Status Management:** The `isf_status` field (e.g., DRAFT, NEW, CREATED, Sent) plays a crucial role in controlling the lifecycle and state of ISF entries.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently uses `try...catch` blocks with custom `HttpError` instances and includes database transaction `ROLLBACK` on error, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Audit Logging:** The `insertAudit` and `simpleAudit` functions are integrated into create/update operations for traceability.
*   **Logging:** `logger.info`, `logger.warn`, and `logger.error` are frequently used for debugging and operational insights.
*   **XML Processing:** Utilities for generating (`isfDescXmlCreate`) and uploading (`isfDescXmlUpload`, `cngISFXmlGenerate`) ISF-related XML files are central to the module's functionality.
*   **Template Management:** A recurring sub-feature is the handling of ISF templates, with dedicated routes and controller logic for adding, updating, and retrieving them.

## 2:47:12 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing the ISF (Importer Security Filing) template management feature within the frontend application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\store\api\ISFDashDataApi.js`**
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:03:32 PM:** The API slice for ISF dashboard data (`isfDashDataApi`) was initially defined. It includes endpoints for fetching ISF dashboards (`fetchIsfDashboard`), creating templates (`createTemplate`), getting templates (`getTemplate`), and updating templates (`updateTemplate`). At this point, the `useUpdateTemplateMutation` hook was defined but not exported.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:07:26 PM:** The `useUpdateTemplateMutation` hook was explicitly added to the exports, making it accessible to other components.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\SaveTemplate.jsx`**
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:04:13 PM:** Initial version of the `SaveTemplate` component, designed to save ISF forms as templates. It used `useCreateTemplateMutation`.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:08:05 PM:** The component was updated to conditionally handle template updates. It imported `useUpdateTemplateMutation` and added logic within `handleSave` to call `updateTemplate` if the `formAction` was 'edit'. There was an initial bug where `createTemplate` would still be called after `updateTemplate` in edit mode.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:14:48 PM:** Significant refactoring occurred. A `useEffect` hook was added to prefill the `templateName` state when in 'edit' mode, expecting `data.template_name`. The `handleSave` logic was corrected to properly differentiate between create and update operations, ensuring only one API call is made. Error handling and toast messages were improved, and a validation for `templateName` was added. Loading states for `createTemplate` and `updateTemplate` were distinguished (`isCreating`, `isUpdating`) and used to disable the save button.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:16:19 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp, likely a re-save.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:41:13 PM:** Debugging `console.log` statements were added for `data` and `state`. The `useEffect` for prefilling `templateName` was noted to still incorrectly look for `data?.template_name` instead of `data?.name`.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:41:43 PM:** The bug in the `useEffect` was fixed, now correctly checking `data?.name` for prefilling the template name when editing.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:43:01 PM:** An attempt was made to directly set the `InputBox` value using `data?.name || templateName`, potentially introducing a conflict with the `useEffect`'s state management.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:44:57 PM:** The `InputBox` value prop was reverted to `templateName`, relying solely on the `useEffect` to manage the prefilling of the `templateName` state for a cleaner approach.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\booking\ISFEntryFormScreen.jsx`**
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:17:16 PM:** This screen component was responsible for rendering the ISF form and modals, including the `SaveTemplate` modal which had a static title "Add New Template".
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:18:24 PM:** The `modalTitle` for the `SaveTemplate` modal was made dynamic, displaying "Edit Template" or "Add New Template" based on the `formAction` passed through `useLocation` state.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:28:27 PM:** A `console.log` statement was added to debug `isfDetails`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\ISFForm.jsx`**
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:22:01 PM:** This large form component handles saving ISF data, creating XML descriptions, and uploading them. It included initial setup for form values related to template and copy actions, ensuring certain fields are cleared when creating from a template. It also implemented conditional navigation based on `actionFrom` after saving.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:23:27 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp, likely a re-save.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:31:11 PM:** `useLocation` was imported and a `console.log` was added to debug location data.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:40:02 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp, likely a re-save.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\action.js`**
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:32:14 PM:** Defined actions for ISF and Template entities. `getTemplateActions` passed the entire `params` object as `row` in the navigation state for 'edit' actions.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:34:24 PM:** Modified `getTemplateActions` to explicitly extract and pass `agent_booking_id` (from `params.ref_id`), `serial_id`, and `template_name` (from `params.name`) to the navigation state, alongside the full `row` object. This provides more structured data to the receiving component.
    *   **10/7/2025, 2:35:45 PM:** Corrected `agent_booking_id` in `getTemplateActions` to use `params.isf_ref` instead of `params.ref_id`, ensuring the correct ISF reference ID is passed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Template Management Focus:** A dominant pattern is the development and refinement of a comprehensive template management system for ISF forms, encompassing creation, editing, and integration with the ISF dashboard.
*   **Redux Toolkit Query Integration:** The use of Redux Toolkit Query for API interactions is central, with consistent patterns for defining queries, mutations, tag types (`ISF`, `TEMP`), and invalidation/provision of tags for data caching.
*   **`useLocation` for Contextual Data:** The `useLocation` hook from `react-router-dom` is extensively used to pass and receive `formAction` (e.g., "edit", "copy", "template") and other contextual data (`data`, `agent_booking_id`, `serial_id`, `template_name`) between routes and components, enabling dynamic behavior based on the user's workflow.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Changes include dynamic modal titles and improved feedback mechanisms (toast notifications for save/error, loading states for buttons) to provide a better user experience during template operations.
*   **Debugging and Refinement:** Multiple `console.log` statements and subsequent corrections (like fixing `template_name` vs `name` and correcting API call logic in `SaveTemplate.jsx`) indicate an iterative development and debugging process.
*   **Data Structure and Transformation:** There's a recurring need to transform incoming data (e.g., from `useLocation` state) into the correct format for forms, and outgoing form data into the appropriate payload structure for API calls.

## 3:41:49 PM
The provided log details recent updates across two files related to ISF (Importer Security Filing) management.

The primary set of changes occurred in `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf.controller.ts`, with identical content recorded at 10/7/2025, 3:33:16 PM and 10/7/2025, 3:33:30 PM. This file defines a controller responsible for various ISF-related operations:

*   **Data Fetching (`fetchEdiPayload`):** It retrieves comprehensive ISF data for a given `agent_booking_id`, including details from `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `isf_commodity_list`, `agent_booking_routing`, and `isf_templates`. It handles date validation and consolidates vessel information, prioritizing "M" (Mother) over "F" (Feeder) if multiple vessels are present.
*   **Creation and Editing (`createEdit`):** This function supports both adding new ISF entries and updating existing ones.
    *   **Update Flow:** It performs an audit before updating, checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` for existing XML status, and updates the `isf_status` based on `draftFlag` or prior `dbStatus`. It then updates `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_routing`. Crucially, it deletes and re-inserts `isf_commodity_list` items to manage associated commodities.
    *   **Add Flow:** It generates a new `agent_booking_id`, inserts a new record into `agent_booking_entry` with an initial status (draft or new), performs a simple audit, and inserts corresponding entries into `agent_booking_vessel` and `agent_booking_routing`.
    *   Both operations are wrapped in database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity and include robust error handling.
*   **XML Generation (`createDescXml`):** This function generates the ISF XML description. It first verifies the record's existence and `isf_status` to prevent re-generation if already "Sent". It also checks `cng_xml_batchlog` for previous XML creation attempts before invoking the `isfXmlGenerator` utility.

A subsequent update, timestamped 10/7/2025, 3:33:51 PM, was made to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\isf.route.ts`. This file establishes the API endpoints for the ISF functionalities, mapping them to the controller functions. The routes include:

*   `GET /`: Fetches EDI payload (`fetchEdiPayload`).
*   `GET /get_all_isf`: Retrieves all ISF dashboard data (`getAllIsfDashboard`).
*   `POST /`: Creates or edits an ISF entry (`createEdit`).
*   `POST /desc_xml`: Generates descriptive XML for ISF (`createDescXml`).
*   `POST /desc_xml_upload`: Uploads the descriptive XML (`uploadDescXml`).
*   `POST /template/add`: Adds an ISF template (`createTemplate`).
*   `PUT /template/update/:serial_id`: Updates an ISF template (`updateTemplate`).
*   `DELETE /template/delete/:serial_id`: Deletes an ISF template (`deleteTemplate`).
*   `GET /template/get`: Retrieves ISF templates (`getTemplates`).
*   `POST /cng_xml`: Generates ISF CNG XML (`generateISFCNGXML`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **ISF Focus:** All changes are centered around the Importer Security Filing (ISF) process, including data management, XML generation, and template handling.
*   **Database Interactions:** Heavy reliance on database queries (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`) and transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for persisting ISF data.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** The `AuditModule` is frequently used (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`) to track changes and actions, alongside extensive `logger.info` and `logger.warn` statements for debugging and operational insights.
*   **XML Generation:** Specific utility functions (`isfXmlGenerator`, `cngISFXmlGenerate`, `isfDescXmlUpload`) are used for handling XML creation and upload, indicating a requirement for external system integration.
*   **Status Management:** The `isf_status` field and `ISFStatus` enum play a crucial role in tracking the state of an ISF entry (e.g., `DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `Sent`).
*   **Modular Structure:** The use of controllers and routes separates concerns, with utilities for specific tasks like XML generation and date validation.

## 3:47:31 PM
The following is a summary of the code changes:

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\SaveTemplate.jsx`

This component is responsible for saving or updating an ISF (Importer Security Filing) form as a template.

*   **10/7/2025, 2:48:00 PM - 2:48:26 PM**: Initial implementation and minor reordering of `console.log` statements. The component allows users to input a template name and save or update an ISF form using `useCreateTemplateMutation` or `useUpdateTemplateMutation`. It uses `useLocation` to determine if the action is 'edit'.
*   **10/7/2025, 2:49:32 PM**: The `useEffect` hook for prefilling the template name was updated. Previously, it prefilled only if `formAction` was 'edit' and `data?.name` existed. Now, it prefills if `data?.name` exists, removing the `formAction === 'edit'` condition.
*   **10/7/2025, 2:50:46 PM**: The "Save" button text was made dynamic, displaying "Update" if `formAction` is 'edit' and "Save" otherwise, instead of showing "Saving..." during API calls.
*   **10/7/2025, 2:51:15 PM - 2:52:35 PM**: Added more `formAction` details to `console.log` statements for debugging.
*   **10/7/2025, 2:54:15 PM**: Renamed the `useLocation` variable from `state` to `location` and updated references accordingly.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:07:08 PM**: Removed inline comments from the `handleSave` function.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:21:24 PM**: The core logic to distinguish between creating and updating a template was significantly changed. Instead of relying on `formAction === 'edit'`, it now checks if `data.serial_id` (an identifier for an existing template) is present. If `serial_id` exists, it calls the `updateTemplate` mutation; otherwise, it calls `createTemplate`.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\ISFForm.jsx`

This extensive update indicates a major refactor or new feature implementation for the ISF form itself.

*   **10/7/2025, 3:06:15 PM**: This commit introduces a comprehensive ISF form component with:
    *   **State Management**: Uses `useState`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, `useSelector`, and `useDispatch` for complex form state, options for various dropdowns (ports, countries, parties), and UI modals.
    *   **API Integrations**: Imports `useIsfDescXmlCreateMutation`, `useIsfDescXmlUploadMutation`, `useSaveISFMutation` for saving ISF data, creating, and uploading XML descriptions.
    *   **Form Handling**: Leverages `Formik` for form structure, validation (`ISFvalidationSchema`), and submission. Initial values are set dynamically based on `formAction` (e.g., clearing certain fields for 'template' mode).
    *   **`handleSave` Function**: Contains complex logic to process form values, clean up temporary fields, transform data (e.g., splitting combined string values), call `saveISF`, and then conditionally call `createDescXml` and `uploadDesc` mutations. It includes toast notifications for user feedback and navigates based on the `action_type` and `actionFrom`.
    *   **User Experience**: Implements `useKeyboardShortcut` for common actions like editing/viewing/adding parties, and saving the form, enhancing keyboard accessibility.
    *   **UI Elements**: Integrates a multitude of UI components including various tab forms (ShipperForm, SupplierForm, etc.), `ThemeTabs`, `TMenu`, `ValidationErrorsPopup`, `DynamicEditableTable`, `ProgressMoniter`, and drawers for party management.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\booking\ISFEntryFormScreen.jsx`

This file is the screen that renders the ISF form and manages related modals.

*   **10/7/2025, 3:07:54 PM**: This update integrates the `SaveTemplate` component as a modal.
    *   **State Management**: Manages `formAction` (add, copy, template, edit), `toggleScreen` (for party actions), `modal` (for `SaveTemplate` and other master forms), and `cityModal`.
    *   **Data Fetching**: Uses `useFetchISFDetailsQuery` to retrieve ISF data for editing or templating.
    *   **`useEffect` Hooks**: Sets the `formAction` based on the URL state and dispatches Redux actions to manage the current party code and reset state on unmount.
    *   **Render**: Displays the `ISFForm` and conditionally renders `ThemedModal` components for `SaveTemplate`, `PartyScreen`/`PartyFormScreen`, and `CityMasterForm`. The `SaveTemplate` modal receives `modal.data` as props.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\action.js`

This file defines action configurations for the ISF dashboard.

*   **10/7/2025, 3:14:29 PM**: Introduces `getISFActions` for general ISF form editing and `getTemplateActions` for template-specific actions. Initially, `getTemplateActions` only included an "Edit" option which opened a modal with template data.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:20:05 PM**: Added `formAction: "edit"` to the data passed to the `setModal` function in `getTemplateActions`, explicitly signaling the modal that it's in edit mode.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:26:38 PM - 3:27:27 PM**: A "Delete" action was added to `getTemplateActions`. Initially a placeholder, it was quickly updated to use the `DeleteOutlined` icon with an `error` color for visual distinction.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:37:33 PM**: The "Delete" action gained functional implementation. It now prompts for user confirmation (`window.confirm`) and attempts to call a `deleteTemplate` function, showing toast messages for feedback. This `deleteTemplate` function is expected to be provided by the component rendering these actions.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:40:33 PM - 3:41:23 PM**: `getTemplateActions` was updated to accept `deleteTemplate` as a parameter, addressing the dependency. There was a temporary revert of the `useDeleteTemplateMutation` import, which implies `deleteTemplate` must be passed down from a parent component that utilizes the RTK Query hook.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`

This component displays the header of the ISF dashboard, including template selection and filtering.

*   **10/7/2025, 3:16:46 PM**: Initial implementation of the ISFDashboardHeader. It fetches templates using `useGetTemplateQuery`, allows filtering by Bill of Lading, Shipper, and Importer, and displays templates as clickable `BoxItem`s. It also integrates a `ThemedModal` to render `SaveTemplate` when editing a template. The modal title was initially "Add New Template".
*   **10/7/2025, 3:18:45 PM**: The modal title for template actions was updated from "Add New Template" to "Update Template", providing better contextual information to the user.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:42:25 PM - 3:42:45 PM**: Integrated the `deleteTemplate` functionality by importing `useDeleteTemplateMutation` and passing the `deleteTemplate` mutation function as a prop to `BoxItem`, which then passes it to `getTemplateActions`. This allows templates to be deleted directly from the dashboard.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:45:49 PM**: Changed the display label for Shipper from "Shipper:1" to "Shipper:" within `BoxItem`.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:46:20 PM**: Made the entire `BoxItem` clickable to trigger `handleTempClick` (for creating new ISF or loading existing templates). Also removed the unused `getISFActions` import.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\store\api\ISFDashDataApi.js`

This Redux Toolkit Query API slice defines endpoints for ISF dashboard data.

*   **10/7/2025, 3:38:21 PM**: A `deleteTemplate` mutation endpoint was added. This endpoint accepts `serial_id`, performs a `DELETE` request to `/isf/template/delete/{serial_id}`, and `invalidatesTags: ["TEMP"]` to automatically refresh the template list after deletion. The `useDeleteTemplateMutation` hook was also exported.

### Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **ISF Template Management**: A central theme across these changes is the development and refinement of ISF template management. This includes creating, editing, and deleting templates, and integrating these actions into the dashboard UI and the ISF form itself.
*   **Redux Toolkit Query**: Heavily utilized for all API interactions (fetching ISF details, creating/updating/deleting templates, saving ISF forms, XML creation/upload), demonstrating a robust data fetching and caching strategy.
*   **`useLocation` for Context**: The `useLocation` hook is consistently used to derive the `formAction` (e.g., 'edit', 'copy', 'template') from the URL state, which then dictates UI behavior and API calls in child components.
*   **Modal-based Interactions**: Modals (`ThemedModal`) are a recurring pattern for displaying sub-forms or actions, ensuring a focused user flow for tasks like saving templates or managing parties.
*   **Toast Notifications**: `react-hot-toast` is omnipresent for providing real-time feedback to the user on the success, failure, or loading status of various operations.
*   **Debugging with `console.log`**: Numerous `console.log` statements are present across files, indicating active development and debugging.
*   **Component Composition**: Complex features are broken down into smaller, reusable components (e.g., `SaveTemplate`, `BoxItem`, `TMenu`, various `tab-forms`).

## 4:47:06 PM
`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\SaveTemplate.jsx`

*   **10/7/2025, 3:48:09 PM**: This file defines a `SaveTemplate` component for saving or updating ISF (Importer Security Filing) forms as templates. It uses `useState` for `templateName`, `useEffect` to pre-fill the name if `data.name` exists, and RTK Query mutations (`useCreateTemplateMutation`, `useUpdateTemplateMutation`) for API calls. It handles form submission, validation (template name required), and displays toast notifications for success or error. Initially, it included `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` to check `formAction` state, and logged debug information.
*   **10/7/2025, 3:48:42 PM**: The `useLocation` import and its associated state variable `formAction`, along with related `console.log` statements, were removed. This suggests that the component's internal logic for distinguishing between create and update operations now relies solely on the `data.serial_id` prop, simplifying the component by removing direct `react-router-dom` dependency for this specific action type.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`

This file underwent extensive, frequent, and granular UI/layout adjustments to the `BoxItem` component, which represents individual ISF templates on the dashboard.

*   **10/7/2025, 3:51:16 PM**: The component `ISFDashboardHeader` is responsible for displaying and filtering ISF templates. It uses `useNavigate` for navigation, RTK Query to fetch/delete templates (`useGetTemplateQuery`, `useDeleteTemplateMutation`), and manages local state for search, filters (shipper, importer, Bill of Lading), and modal visibility. It renders `BoxItem` components for "New ISF" and existing templates. The `BoxItem` includes an icon, optional country origin badge, and a three-dot menu (`TMenu`).
*   **10/7/2025, 3:55:26 PM - 4:20:58 PM (Series of rapid changes, mainly UI positioning)**: This period shows a concentrated effort to refactor and adjust the layout of the top-right elements (country origin badge and action menu) within the `BoxItem`.
    *   Initially, `html2canvas`'s `display` import was added then removed (3:55:26 PM -> 3:57:57 PM).
    *   There were multiple attempts to align and space the country badge and menu using nested `Stack` and `Box` components, as well as inline `div` styles with `position: absolute`, `top`, `right`, `gap`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`. These changes frequently involved commenting out/uncommenting, adding/removing, or adjusting pixel values for these CSS properties, indicating an iterative process of fine-tuning.
    *   The order of rendering the menu and country badge was swapped back and forth.
    *   Debug `console.log` statements were added and removed.
*   **10/7/2025, 4:22:36 PM**: A significant refactoring of the `BoxItem` header layout occurred, moving to a more structured approach using distinct `Stack` components for left-aligned icons and right-aligned country/menu elements. This resulted in a cleaner and more maintainable layout structure. The absolute positioning for the country badge was removed from `styles.date` and its positioning was integrated into the flexbox layout.
*   **10/7/2025, 4:25:05 PM**: Further consolidation and simplification of the `BoxItem` header, specifically merging nested `Box` elements and applying `spacing` and `gap` directly to the `Stack` for the right-side elements. The `position: absolute`, `top`, `right` from `styles.date` were again commented out.
*   **10/7/2025, 4:27:57 PM - 4:29:10 PM**: More minor adjustments to the inner `Stack` for the country badge and menu, including adding `justifyContent="flex-end"`, `display="flex"`, and then removing `spacing` and `gap`.
*   **10/7/2025, 4:30:29 PM**: The layout was partially reverted to include a `Grid` wrapper within the `BoxItem` header, and the absolute positioning for `styles.date` was toggled back on (4:30:44 PM).
*   **10/7/2025, 4:35:10 PM - 4:39:51 PM**: Continued granular adjustments to the positioning of the country badge (`top` property in `styles.date` changed from `10px` to `20px` to `22px`), and spacing of the menu (`ml: 2` added to `TMenu` container, `spacing` in parent `Stack` changed from `1` to `2`).
*   **10/7/2025, 4:43:13 PM - 4:45:10 PM**: Debugging `console.log` statements were added and removed, and a temporary "@@" marker in `Typography` was removed, signaling the end of a specific development or testing phase for the `BoxItem`'s title.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\ISFForm.jsx`

*   **10/7/2025, 3:53:10 PM**: This extensive file represents a complex ISF form. It uses `Formik` for form state and validation, and integrates multiple sub-forms (`ShipperForm`, `SupplierForm`, etc.). It orchestrates saving ISF data, including conditional XML generation and upload through API mutations. The component includes various Redux actions, a custom `useReducer` for options, and several keyboard shortcuts for enhanced user interaction (e.g., `ctrl+u` for editing party, `ctrl+s` for saving). It also has conditional logic to clear specific fields when loading a 'template' `formAction`.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\alc\AlcScreen.jsx`

*   **10/7/2025, 4:32:12 PM**: This file defines an ALC (Automated Load Control) screen. It fetches MBL (Master Bill of Lading) numbers and ALC payload data using RTK Query. It includes filtering capabilities for various fields (ETD, ETA, PO, SKU, BOL, container). Key features include:
    *   Dynamically fetching data for selected rows in view or export mode.
    *   Calculating a grand total row for displayed data.
    *   Grouping data by PO number for export.
    *   Handling row selections in a DataGrid.
    *   An `ExceptionModal` for viewing errors when data is "GENERATED WITH EXCEPTION".
    *   A `CustomNoRowsOverlay` to inform users when data isn't ready due to unmet shipment milestones.
    *   A `useRef` and `useMemo` pattern to ensure a specific master MBL number from the route state is processed only once on initialization.
*   **10/7/2025, 4:39:58 PM**: No discernible changes from the previous entry.

**Overall Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   **ISF & ALC Module Development:** A clear focus on two modules: ISF for template management and form submission, and ALC for data viewing, filtering, and export.
*   **Intensive UI Refinements:** `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx` shows numerous, minute adjustments to UI elements' positioning and styling, highlighting an ongoing iterative design and implementation process to achieve precise visual layouts.
*   **RTK Query Usage:** Consistent use of RTK Query for data fetching (`useGetTemplateQuery`, `useFetchMBlNoQuery`, `useLazyFetchAclPayloadQuery`) and mutations (`useCreateTemplateMutation`, `useUpdateTemplateMutation`, `useDeleteTemplateMutation`, `useIsfDescXmlCreateMutation`, `useIsfDescXmlUploadMutation`, `useSaveISFMutation`) across the application.
*   **React Hooks for State Management:** Extensive application of `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useRef` for component logic, state management, and performance optimization.
*   **User Feedback & Navigation:** Frequent use of `react-hot-toast` for user notifications and `react-router-dom`'s navigation hooks for routing within the application, often passing state.
*   **Debugging Statements:** The presence and subsequent removal/modification of `console.log` statements across different files indicate active development and debugging during the recorded timestamps.
*   **Feature Integration:** `ISFForm.jsx` demonstrates integration of complex form handling, API workflows, and keyboard shortcuts, suggesting a focus on robust and efficient user interaction for critical forms.

## 5:41:50 PM
The `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\BMQuery.ts` file, last modified on October 7, 2025, at 5:22:00 PM, defines a `BMQuery` TypeScript class. This class is designed to construct various SQL queries for retrieving different types of accounts from a database.

**Key Information and Patterns:**

*   **Purpose:** The `BMQuery` class acts as a query builder, specifically for fetching account details (like company name, address, contact info) based on a provided keyword.
*   **Constructor:** It initializes with `location` and `keyword`, converting the `keyword` to lowercase for case-insensitive searching.
*   **Query Structure:** All methods within the class (`getBuyer`, `getSeller`, `getImporter`, `getNotify`, `getShipTo`, `getShipper`, `getCSL`, `getConsolidator`, `getManufacturer`, `getConsignee`, `getBondHolder`, `getCustomBroker`) return SQL query strings. These queries consistently select data from `agent_po_account_master` (aliased as `am`) joined with `agent_po_account_master_type` (aliased as `at`) on `acode`.
*   **Filtering by Account Type (`atype`):** A primary filtering mechanism across all queries is `at.atype`, which specifies roles like 'BUYER', 'SELLER', 'IMPORTER', 'CONSIGNEE', 'SHIPPER', 'NOTIFY', 'SHIP_TO', 'CSL', 'CONSOLIDATOR', 'MANUFACTURER', 'BOND_HOLDER', and 'CUSTOM_BROKER'.
*   **Keyword Search (`cname`):** Every query includes a `WHERE` clause with `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '${this.keyword}%'`, indicating a fuzzy, case-insensitive search for company names starting with the provided keyword.
*   **Distinct Results:** Most queries use `DISTINCT ON (am.cname)` to ensure that each company name appears only once in the results.
*   **Additional `cname` Validation:** For certain roles (Buyer, Importer, Shipper, Consignee), there's an additional check (`am.cname in ((select distinct cname from po_accountmaster_customer_master) union (select distinct cname from agent_po_account_master))`) which suggests validating company names against a broader set of customer or agent master data.
*   **Specific Column Selection:** While many columns are common (`cname`, `acode`, `addressl1-3`, `zipcode`, `city`, `state`, `country`), specific queries include additional fields relevant to their type, such as `email`, `contact_person`, `location`, `id_type`, `id_no`, and `config`.
*   **Limiting Results:** The `getCSL` method explicitly limits results to `LIMIT 10`.

This file centralizes and standardizes the generation of database queries for various types of business partners within the application, based on a search keyword and account role.

## 5:47:16 PM
The code changes primarily occurred across four files within the `t360-frontend` directory, all on **10/7/2025**, indicating a focused development session. Key updates and patterns include:

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\SaveTemplate.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant): 10/7/2025, 4:47:31 PM** - This component, responsible for saving and updating ISF templates, was initially structured. It imports Material-UI components, utilizes React state (`useState`, `useEffect`), and integrates Redux Toolkit Query mutations (`useCreateTemplateMutation`, `useUpdateTemplateMutation`) for API interactions. It also uses `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 4:48:23 PM** - Enhanced the "Save" button text to show "Saving..." dynamically when API calls are in progress (`isCreating` or `isUpdating`).
    *   **Timestamps (Iterative Refinement): 10/7/2025, 4:49:08 PM, 4:50:49 PM, 4:51:03 PM, 4:52:30 PM, 5:07:11 PM** - These entries show an iterative process of refactoring the `handleSave` function, particularly regarding the handling of `res` (response) variables and conditional logic for `createTemplate` vs. `updateTemplate`. There were several instances of local `const res` declarations shadowing an outer `let res`, which were gradually addressed, though some inconsistencies in error handling and success messages remained or were reintroduced across these specific commits. The validation for `templateName` was also simplified (removing the explicit toast for empty input at **5:07:11 PM**).

2.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\store\api\ISFDashDataApi.js`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant): 10/7/2025, 4:54:55 PM** - This file defined the Redux Toolkit Query API slice for ISF dashboard data. It includes endpoints for fetching ISF dashboards (`fetchIsfDashboard`), and CRUD operations for templates (`createTemplate`, `getTemplate`, `updateTemplate`, `deleteTemplate`). `tagTypes` "ISF" and "TEMP" are used for cache invalidation. A `console.log` was added to the `updateTemplate` mutation.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:18:41 PM** - No functional code changes; likely a re-save or minor formatting adjustment.

3.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant): 10/7/2025, 5:10:33 PM** - This component was introduced or significantly updated to display the ISF dashboard header. It includes a toolbar with search and filter options (Bill of Lading, Shipper, Importer), a toggle to show all templates, and renders `BoxItem` components for "New ISF" and existing templates. It utilizes `useGetTemplateQuery` to fetch templates and includes a `ThemedModal` for updating templates using the `SaveTemplate` component.
    *   **Timestamps (Debugging): 10/7/2025, 5:12:25 PM, 5:13:59 PM, 5:14:40 PM** - Minor `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes, primarily to inspect `item` within the template map and `TemplateItems` in the `useMemo` hook, with one correction to log the correct variable.

4.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant): 10/7/2025, 5:23:24 PM** - This component was developed for ISF dashboard search functionality. It implements a search form using `formik`, manages autocomplete options via `useReducer`, and dispatches updates to a Redux slice (`ISFDashboardSlice`). It dynamically fetches autocomplete options for Shipper, Importer, and Consignee. Notably, the "Delivery To" autocomplete initially used `options.importer` for its options.
    *   **Timestamps (Styling & Layout): 10/7/2025, 5:27:43 PM, 5:28:02 PM, 5:28:53 PM, 5:29:05 PM, 5:29:15 PM, 5:29:35 PM, 5:30:09 PM, 5:31:26 PM, 5:31:49 PM, 5:32:03 PM, 5:33:05 PM, 5:33:24 PM, 5:33:32 PM** - A series of rapid-fire adjustments were made to the styling and layout of the "Delivery To" autocomplete and action buttons, experimenting with `flex` properties, explicit `width`, and `justifyContent` to control alignment within a `Stack` hierarchy. An unused `Widgets` icon import was also added.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:37:15 PM** - Attempted to fix a bug in the `AppAutocomplete` component for "Shipper Name" by correctly binding its `value` prop to an object from `options.shipper` rather than just a string.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:37:46 PM** - Reverted the `AppAutocomplete` value binding for "Shipper Name" back to a string, potentially reintroducing the bug.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:41:50 PM** - Added an `isClearable` prop to the "Shipper Name" `AppAutocomplete`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:44:30 PM** - Added a `console.log` for `formik.values`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Redux Toolkit Query Integration:** `ISFDashDataApi.js` provides the API definitions, which are then consumed by `SaveTemplate.jsx` (for mutations) and `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx` (for queries). `tagTypes` and cache invalidation are consistently used.
*   **Material-UI (MUI) Components:** All frontend components heavily rely on MUI for UI elements and layout (`Stack`, `Box`, `Alert`, `Button`, `TextField`, `Typography`, `Grid`, `IconButton`, etc.).
*   **Form Management with Formik:** `ISFSearchForm.jsx` demonstrates a recurring pattern of using `useFormik` for form state, submission, and validation.
*   **Iterative Development & Debugging:** Frequent, rapid changes (especially in `ISFSearchForm.jsx`'s styling and `SaveTemplate.jsx`'s logic) coupled with numerous `console.log` statements suggest an active, iterative development and debugging process.
*   **Toast Notifications:** `react-hot-toast` is a recurring element for displaying user feedback (success/error messages) across the application.
*   **Autocomplete Logic:** `ISFSearchForm.jsx` uses a `useReducer` to manage options for multiple autocomplete fields, fetching them via a common `ApiManager` service.
*   **Error Handling:** Catch blocks generally provide generic "An unexpected error occurred" or "Something went wrong" messages via toasts.

## 6:41:55 PM
The provided log details changes to the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf.controller.ts`, timestamped 10/7/2025, 5:53:47 PM. This file appears to be a core controller for managing Importer Security Filing (ISF) data within a backend application.

Key updates and patterns observed:

1.  **Comprehensive ISF Data Structure**: The file defines an extensive `fields` array enumerating numerous data points related to shipping (shipper, shipto, notify, consolidator, importer, customs broker, buyer, seller), locations (pickup, destination, POL, POD), vessel details, and various ISF-specific identifiers (`cnee_id_type`, `bond_activity`, `filing_type`, `scac_code`, `isf_status`). This suggests a robust system for collecting and managing ISF information.

2.  **`fetchEdiPayload` Function**: This function is responsible for retrieving a complete ISF payload for a given `agent_booking_id`. It queries data from `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `isf_commodity_list`, and `agent_booking_routing` tables, aggregates the information, and performs date validation (`isValidDate`) before returning the consolidated ISF data.

3.  **`createEdit` Function**: This is a central function handling both the creation and modification of ISF records.
    *   It uses a transaction block (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data integrity during multi-table operations.
    *   **Update Logic**: For existing records, it inserts an audit log, checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` table to determine the current `isf_status` (maintaining existing status if applicable, or setting to `CREATED`), and updates records across `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_routing`. It specifically deletes and re-inserts commodity list items (`isf_commodity_list`) during an update.
    *   **Creation Logic**: For new records, it generates a unique `agent_booking_id` using `getAgentBookingCode`, inserts a new entry into `agent_booking_entry` with an `isf_status` of `DRAFT` or `NEW`, and creates corresponding entries in `agent_booking_vessel` and `agent_booking_routing`. A simple audit log is also recorded for creation.
    *   **Commodity List Handling**: Both creation and update paths include iterating through an `htsList` to insert or update commodity details.
    *   It incorporates user role (`req.user.role`) and location for auditing and data population.

4.  **`createDescXml` Function**: This function initiates the generation of ISF XML.
    *   It first checks the `isf_status` in `agent_booking_entry` to prevent re-generating XML if it's already "Sent."
    *   It utilizes an `isfXmlGenerator` module, passing the `agent_booking_no` and `userId` to create the XML.
    *   Error handling is present to catch issues during XML generation.

5.  **`uploadDescXml` Function**: Only the partial beginning of this function is provided, showing a `SELECT` query. Its full functionality for uploading the generated XML is not visible.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns**:

*   **Database Interactions**: There is extensive use of `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions for all CRUD operations, indicating a custom database abstraction layer.
*   **Auditing**: The system frequently uses `insertAudit` and `simpleAudit` modules, highlighting a strong emphasis on tracking changes and user actions within the ISF process.
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent use of `HttpError` and `next(new HttpError(...))` for propagating errors and providing meaningful messages.
*   **Status Management**: The `ISFStatus` enum (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `Sent`) is central to managing the lifecycle of an ISF record.
*   **Logging**: `logger.info`, `logger.warn`, and `logger.error` are used throughout the controller for debugging and operational insights.
*   **Modularization**: Imports suggest a well-structured application with separate modules for database, booking utilities, XML generation, and auditing.
*   **`agent_booking_id`**: This ID serves as the primary foreign key linking various related ISF data across multiple tables.

## 6:47:21 PM
The provided log details a series of changes related to an ISF (Importer Security Filing) dashboard and its associated entry forms in a React frontend application, all occurring on October 7th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\action.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:48:52 PM):** This file was created to define interactive actions. It exports `getISFActions` for navigating to an ISF edit form and `getTemplateActions` which provides "Edit" (opening a modal for template data) and "Delete" (with confirmation and API call via `deleteTemplate` mutation) functionalities for ISF templates.
*   **`src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx` (Timestamps: 10/7/2025, 5:49:37 PM - 6:42:02 PM):** This component, responsible for the ISF Dashboard's upper section, saw several updates.
    *   **Initial Implementation (5:49:37 PM):** Established the header with search functionality (by Bill of Lading), shipper and importer filters, and a toggle to show all or a limited number of ISF templates. It uses `useGetTemplateQuery` to fetch template data and `useDeleteTemplateMutation` for template deletion. It renders `BoxItem` components for "New ISF" and existing templates, displaying details like title, subtitle, shipper, POL, POD, and country of origin, along with a context menu for actions.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (5:49:56 PM onwards):** Primarily involved minor cleanups, such as removing debugging `console.log` statements, and small UI layout adjustments within the `BoxItem` component. This included repositioning the country of origin badge (6:32:03 PM) and refining flexbox justifications (6:38:36 PM). A structural refactoring occurred (6:41:26 PM) where the styling and click handler for `BoxItem` were moved to its outermost `Grid item`, simplifying its rendering structure.
*   **`src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx` (Timestamps: 10/7/2025, 5:50:21 PM - 6:29:55 PM):** This component provides the detailed search and filter form for the dashboard.
    *   **Initial Implementation (5:50:21 PM):** Defined form fields for MBL#, BL#, SCAC, HTS#, Shipper Name, Importer Name, and Delivery To. It uses Formik for form state management and Redux to update dashboard filters. Autocomplete fields dynamically fetch options using `ApiManager.getCommonOptions`.
    *   **Improvements (6:01:29 PM, 6:02:05 PM):** Enhanced the robustness of `AppAutocomplete` components for "Shipper Name", "Importer Name", and "Delivery To" by explicitly setting their `value` prop to `null` if the corresponding formik value is empty, preventing potential React warnings for uncontrolled components.
    *   **Bug Fix (6:29:55 PM):** A critical bug was resolved where the "Delivery To" autocomplete was incorrectly populating its options from the importer list; this was corrected to use the consignee options (`options.consignee`). A debugging `console.log` was also added (6:28:02 PM) to inspect API responses.
*   **`src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:50:41 PM):** This file defines the column schema for the ISF dashboard's data grid. It includes various data fields like "ISF Ref #", "Bill of Lading #", "ETD", "Importer Name", and "Status". Many columns utilize `renderCell` functions to format displayed data, apply conditional styling (e.g., colored `Chip` components for ISF Status, CBP Response, and BOL Status), and map raw values to more readable formats.
*   **`src\pages\booking\ISFEntryFormScreen.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:50:54 PM):** This screen serves as the entry point for creating or editing ISF forms. It dynamically adapts its `formAction` (add, copy, template) based on navigation state, fetches ISF details, and orchestrates several modals for related tasks such as saving templates, managing parties (`PartyScreen`, `PartyFormScreen`), and adding city details (`CityMasterForm`).
*   **`src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 5:51:08 PM):** This is the main ISF Dashboard screen, bringing together all dashboard functionalities. It uses Redux to manage pagination, sorting, and filtering state. It fetches ISF dashboard data, dynamically renders the action column using `getISFActions`, and includes a `useEffect` hook to automatically refetch data when a "saved" operation is indicated by the navigation state, ensuring data freshness. A manual refresh button is also provided.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/7/2025, 5:48:52 PM - 5:51:08 PM:** Initial creation and establishment of core ISF dashboard components, forms, actions, and column definitions. This period represents the foundational development.
*   **10/7/2025, 6:02:05 PM:** Completion of a pattern of fixes in `ISFSearchForm.jsx` to improve the handling of `null` values in autocomplete components.
*   **10/7/2025, 6:29:55 PM:** A critical functional correction in `ISFSearchForm.jsx` to correctly source options for the "Delivery To" field.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular React Components:** The codebase is highly modular, organized into distinct React components responsible for specific UI sections or functionalities.
*   **Centralized State Management (Redux/RTK Query):** Redux and Redux Toolkit Query are extensively used for managing application state, fetching data, and handling mutations, ensuring a predictable data flow.
*   **Material-UI (MUI) Framework:** The application heavily relies on MUI components and icons for a consistent and responsive user interface.
*   **Form Management:** Formik is the chosen library for managing complex form states and validation.
*   **Data Grid and Dynamic Actions:** The dashboard utilizes a data grid with dynamically rendered columns and actions, allowing for flexible display and interaction.
*   **Unified Development Window:** All changes are logged on the same date within a close timeframe, suggesting a focused development effort or a single feature sprint.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The presence and subsequent removal of `console.log` statements in `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx` and `ISFSearchForm.jsx` indicate an iterative development process with active debugging.

## 9:36:07 PM
All recorded changes pertain to a single file: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf.controller.ts`.

A series of updates occurred on October 7, 2025, concentrated within a 12-minute window, specifically between 7:14:41 PM and 7:26:34 PM.

The code content provided for all these timestamps is identical. This suggests that the updates were either non-functional (e.g., whitespace changes, comment modifications, or changes in unlogged parts of the file), or simply repeated saves of the same content.

**Key functionalities and patterns observed in the `isf.controller.ts` file include:**

*   **ISF Data Management:** The file acts as a controller for Importer Security Filing (ISF) data, handling various operations related to `agent_booking_entry`.
*   **Extensive Data Fields:** A large `fields` array defines numerous properties for ISF-related entities like shipper, consignee, importer, customs broker, and vessel information, indicating a comprehensive data model.
*   **CRUD Operations:** It contains functions for:
    *   `fetchEdiPayload`: Retrieves ISF booking data, vessel information, commodity lists, and routing details from the database based on `agent_booking_id`. It normalizes dates and merges various data sources.
    *   `createEdit`: Handles both creation (EntryMode.ADD) and updating (EntryMode.UPDATE) of ISF records. It manages `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_routing`, and `isf_commodity_list` tables.
*   **ISF Status Workflow:** The `createEdit` function incorporates logic to determine and update the `isf_status` (e.g., `DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`), checking against existing log entries in `cng_xml_batchlog`.
*   **XML Generation:**
    *   `createDescXml`: Initiates the generation of ISF XML description, using `isfXmlGenerator`. It performs checks to prevent re-creation if the XML has already been sent.
    *   `uploadDescXml`: (Partially visible) This function is intended to handle the upload of the generated ISF XML.
*   **Database Transactions:** Most write operations (`createEdit`) are wrapped in database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data integrity.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** The controller integrates auditing (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`) to track changes and extensive logging (`logger.info`, `logger.warn`, `logger.error`) for debugging and operational insights.
*   **Error Handling:** It consistently uses `HttpError` to manage and propagate errors with specific HTTP status codes.
*   **Utility Imports:** Relies on several utility functions for database interactions (`insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`), booking code generation (`getAgentBookingCode`), date validation (`isValidDate`), and XML processing (`isfXmlGenerator`, `isfDescXmlUpload`).
*   **User Context:** User-specific information (role, location, company name, userid) from `AuthenticatedRequest` is used to determine booking context and for audit trails.

## 9:36:25 PM
The code changes log primarily details modifications to two JavaScript files within a React application's ISF dashboard feature, occurring on October 7, 2025.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`**

This file, responsible for the header and template display of the ISF dashboard, underwent several small, iterative visual and layout adjustments between 6:48:13 PM and 7:11:43 PM.

*   **Initial Structure (6:48:13 PM):** The component was set up with navigation, state management for search filters (`search`, `shipper`, `importer`), modal control, and API interactions for fetching and deleting ISF templates. It rendered a toolbar with search and filter inputs and a grid of `BoxItem` components for "New ISF" and existing templates. Each `BoxItem` included a title, subtitle, shipper, POL, POD, and a three-dot menu for actions. The `country_origin` was displayed using a `styles.date` class.
*   **7:03:40 PM:** The styling for the `country_origin` display within the `BoxItem` was refactored. It moved from using a dedicated `styles.date` class to inline `sx` props, adopting a light grey background (`#f0f0f0`) and adjusting padding and icon spacing. The parent `Grid item md={12}` was updated to center align items and distribute space.
*   **7:04:28 PM:** The light grey background for `country_origin` was removed, making it transparent.
*   **7:06:05 PM:** The `country_origin` display's background was changed to a distinct yellow (`#e1b300`).
*   **7:07:10 PM:** Padding for the `country_origin` display was adjusted (`px: 1.5`), and `gap` was introduced for spacing between the icon and text. The background and text colors were set to match the original `styles.date` definition, suggesting a reapplication of its visual style through inline props.
*   **7:07:53 PM:** A `marginRight` (`mr: 1`) was added to the `Box` containing the `TMenu` within `BoxItem`, shifting the menu slightly to the left.
*   **7:08:52 PM:** The horizontal padding (`px`) for the `country_origin` display was reduced to `0.5`.
*   **7:10:48 PM:** Structural changes improved the layout of the `BoxItem` header. The `Stack` containing the icon and country badge was given `flex: 1, minWidth: 0` for better space distribution. The `TMenu`'s parent `Box` was updated with `marginLeft` (`ml: 2`).
*   **7:11:18 PM - 7:11:43 PM:** The `marginLeft` for the `TMenu`'s parent `Box` was incrementally increased (`ml: 10`, then `ml: 12`, then `ml: 18`), repeatedly pushing the three-dot menu further to the right to refine its positioning.
*   **No content change:** The entries at 6:56:55 PM, 7:08:40 PM, and 7:12:13 PM appear to be identical to their preceding versions, possibly representing saves without functional alterations.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`**

This file, which provides a search form for ISF data, had a single functional fix.

*   **Initial Structure (9:32:41 PM):** The component utilized Redux for state, `useReducer` for autocomplete options, and `formik` for form management. It featured various input fields and autocomplete components for filtering ISF data, with logic to fetch options from an API.
*   **9:35:39 PM:** A data binding issue was resolved for the "Shipper Name" `AppAutocomplete` component. The `value` prop was changed from `formik.values.ship_name` to `formik.values.shipper` to align with the `shipper` field defined in the `formik`'s `initialValues`.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frontend Focus:** All changes are concentrated on the frontend (`t360-frontend`) in React components, indicating ongoing UI/UX development and refinement.
*   **MUI Styling:** Extensive use of Material-UI (MUI) components (`Box`, `Grid`, `Stack`, `Typography`, `TextField`, `IconButton`, `Tooltip`, `SelectBox`) and their `sx` prop for inline styling is a recurring pattern, especially in `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`.
*   **Incremental UI Adjustments:** The multiple, rapid changes to `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx` illustrate an iterative process of fine-tuning component layouts and visual aesthetics, particularly concerning spacing, padding, and background colors.
*   **Form Management:** The use of `formik` for form handling and Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management is consistent across the dashboard-related components.
*   **API Interaction:** Both components implicitly or explicitly interact with an API (`ISFDashDataApi` for `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`, `ApiManager.getCommonOptions` for `ISFSearchForm.jsx`) to fetch data, suggesting a data-driven application.
*   **Debugging Statements:** The presence of `console.log` statements throughout the code in both components suggests active development and debugging.

## 10:39:18 PM
This code log details significant changes to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf.controller.ts`, with the recorded timestamp of the update being **10/7/2025, 9:38:03 PM**.

The update primarily focuses on the **Importer Security Filing (ISF)** functionality within the application. Key changes and additions include:

*   **Comprehensive ISF Data Handling**: A very extensive `fields` array has been defined, encompassing a wide range of data points for ISF, including detailed address information for various parties (shipper, consignee, importer, customs broker, buyer, seller, manufacturer, etc.), location details (pickup, destination, POL, POD), booking specifics (MBL/BL numbers, dates), and various identification/bond types. This indicates a robust structure for storing ISF-related information.
*   **`fetchEdiPayload` Function**: This new or updated function is responsible for retrieving and consolidating ISF-related data. It queries `agent_booking_entry` using the defined `fields`, and also fetches associated vessel information from `agent_booking_vessel`, commodity details from `isf_commodity_list`, and routing data (ETD, ETA) from `agent_booking_routing`. It includes logic to select the primary vessel (mother or feeder) and validates dates.
*   **`createEdit` Function**: This function serves as a central point for both adding new ISF entries and updating existing ones.
    *   It uses database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.
    *   **Update Flow**: It now incorporates detailed audit logging (`insertAudit`), checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` table for existing ISF XML statuses, and updates `agent_booking_entry` along with related `agent_booking_vessel` and `agent_booking_routing` tables. Importantly, it deletes and re-inserts commodity list items for updates. ISF status management (`ISFStatus.DRAFT`, `ISFStatus.NEW`, or existing DB status) is handled.
    *   **Add Flow**: It generates a unique `agent_booking_id`, inserts initial ISF data into `agent_booking_entry` with an `isf_status`, performs a `simpleAudit` log, and then inserts associated vessel, routing, and commodity list data.
    *   Both flows manage the insertion of `isf_commodity_list` items.
    *   Extensive error handling with `HttpError` is present to catch and roll back failed operations.
*   **`createDescXml` Function**: This function is responsible for generating the ISF XML description.
    *   It first validates the `agent_booking_no` and checks the current `isf_status` in `agent_booking_entry` (e.g., preventing XML creation if already "Sent").
    *   It also checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` to see if an XML has already been created for a given `agent_booking_no`.
    *   It utilizes an `isfXmlGenerator` utility, setting the `agentBookingId` and `userId` before creating the XML.
    *   Error handling is included for XML generation failures.
*   **`uploadDescXml` Function**: This function is partially provided but its name suggests it handles the upload of the generated ISF XML.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:

*   **Database Interactions**: There's a strong pattern of interacting with multiple related tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_routing`, `isf_commodity_list`, `cng_xml_batchlog`) using `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions.
*   **`agent_booking_id`**: This ID serves as a crucial linking identifier across all ISF-related data, facilitating data retrieval and modification.
*   **Audit Logging**: The integration of `insertAudit` and `simpleAudit` functions demonstrates a commitment to tracking changes and actions related to ISF entries.
*   **Status Management**: The code actively manages `isf_status` (e.g., DRAFT, NEW, CREATED, Sent) to control the lifecycle and validity of ISF operations.
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent use of `HttpError` and `next(new HttpError(...))` for robust error management across all functions.
*   **Utility Usage**: Reliance on various utility functions (`getAgentBookingCode`, `isValidDate`, `isfXmlGenerator`, `cngISFXmlGenerate`) for specific tasks.

## 10:39:23 PM
The changes primarily focus on enhancing the ISF Dashboard functionality, including improved search capabilities, dynamic grid column handling, and clearer data visualization.

In `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx` (10/7/2025, 9:36:28 PM), a new search form component was introduced. This component integrates `formik` for managing form state and `useReducer` for handling dynamic autocomplete options for fields like Shipper, Importer, and Consignee. It dispatches search parameters to the Redux store (`ISFDashboardSlice`) and leverages an `ApiManager` to fetch autocomplete suggestions based on user input. The form includes input boxes for MBL#, BL#, SCAC, HTS# and `AppAutocomplete` for name-based searches, along with "apply" and "reset" actions.

The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx` underwent several iterative changes:

*   **10/7/2025, 9:43:07 PM:** The initial implementation of the ISF Dashboard screen was established. It fetches ISF data using `useFetchIsfDashboardQuery`, manages pagination and sorting via Redux (`ISFDashboardSlice`), and includes `useEffect` to refetch data after specific state changes (e.g., a 'saved' operation). The grid's action column (`ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[0].renderCell`) was directly modified to include `GridActions` with `getISFActions`. The UI components include `ThemedBreadcrumb`, `ISFDashboardHeader`, `GridSearchInput`, `ISFDashFilters`, `SelectBox` for sorting, and `ThemedGrid` to display the data, along with a refresh icon.
*   **10/7/2025, 9:51:27 PM:** The method for defining grid columns was refined. The direct modification of `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[0].renderCell` was commented out. Instead, a `React.useMemo` hook was introduced to create a `columns` array, which copied `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` and then specifically updated the `renderCell` for the first column within this memoized array. This aimed to optimize column definition and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   **10/7/2025, 9:58:35 PM:** The `React.useMemo` implementation for columns was reverted. The `ThemedGrid` component now directly receives `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS(nav)` as its `columns` prop. This change implies that the dynamic `GridActions` are now integrated directly into the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` definition itself, making the column configuration function responsible for rendering actions based on the `nav` object.

Concurrently, the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` file (10/7/2025, 9:58:13 PM) was updated to support this new column definition strategy. It now exports `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` as a function that accepts a `nav` (navigation) object. The 'Action' column's `renderCell` is explicitly defined within this function to use `GridActions` and `getISFActions(nav)`, completing the shift of action column rendering logic to the column definition file. Additionally, this file introduced more visual enhancements for various status columns (`isf_status`, `cbp_status`, `remarks`), rendering them as `Chip` components with dynamic colors and icons for better readability. Date fields across the grid now consistently use `appDateFormat` for display.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Redux Integration:** Extensive use of `useDispatch` and `useSelector` to manage global state (pagination, filters, form data) across components.
*   **Component-Driven Development:** A consistent pattern of using reusable common components like `InputBox`, `AppAutocomplete`, `ThemedGrid`, `GridSearchInput`, and `SelectBox`.
*   **Dynamic Data Grids:** Heavy reliance on dynamic column definitions and data fetching to populate interactive data grids.
*   **Status Visualization:** Frequent use of `Chip` components with color-coded icons to represent various statuses in a user-friendly manner.
*   **Evolution of Column Management:** A clear progression in how grid column definitions, especially for actions, are handled, moving towards encapsulating dynamic behavior within the column definition itself for better maintainability and modularity.
*   **Date Formatting:** `appDateFormat` is a recurring utility for standardized date display.

## 11:39:28 PM
The code changes detail significant updates to an ISF (Importer Security Filing) module within a backend system, focusing on data structure definitions, controller logic for managing ISF records, and XML generation/upload. Both files were updated on **10/7/2025**, within seconds of each other, indicating a cohesive set of changes.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\types\isf.types.ts`**
(Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 11:30:40 PM)

This file introduces and refines several TypeScript types and interfaces crucial for ISF data handling:
*   **Data Structures for XML and Input:** `XmlFile`, `IXmlResult` are defined for XML-related operations, while `commodityType` and `DataInput` (with support for dynamic fields) specify the structure for ISF data input.
*   **Address and Party Details:** Comprehensive types like `Address`, `AddressDetail`, and `PartiesType` are provided to handle various address roles (e.g., shipper, consignee) and their associated identification details. `CommoditiesI` defines the structure for commodity information (HTS number, country).
*   **Temporary and Payload Data:** `TempData` offers a flexible structure with many optional fields, likely for intermediate or partial ISF data. `Payload` and `FileData` provide generic interfaces for process results and file tracking.
*   **Query and Status Management:** `ISFQueryType` standardizes the parameters for querying ISF records, covering a wide range of filters. Crucially, two enums, `ISFStatus` (e.g., DRAFT, NEW, SENT, FAILED_TO_SEND) and `ISFCNGStatus` (e.g., NOT_SENT, SENT_TO_CNG), are introduced to track the lifecycle and transmission status of ISF entries.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf.controller.ts`**
(Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 11:30:54 PM)

This controller handles the core business logic for ISF. Key updates include:
*   **Extensive Field Definition:** A large `fields` constant is defined, listing over 100 specific data points related to various parties (shipper, shipto, notify, consolidator, importer, customs broker, buyer, seller, manufacturer, consignee, bond holder) and shipment details (addresses, codes, names, dates, MBL/BL numbers, country, location, status). This list is central to how ISF data is retrieved and updated.
*   **`fetchEdiPayload` Function:** This new function is responsible for assembling a comprehensive ISF payload. It queries `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `isf_commodity_list`, and `agent_booking_routing` tables, combining and validating data (e.g., date formats, vessel selection logic).
*   **`createEdit` Function:** This function handles both creation and updates of ISF entries.
    *   It uses database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) for data integrity.
    *   Includes robust audit logging using `insertAudit` and `simpleAudit`.
    *   Manages the `isf_status`, setting it to `DRAFT` or `NEW` for new entries/updates, but also preserving existing statuses (like `CREATED`) found in the `cng_xml_batchlog` table.
    *   Performs `insertQuery` or `updateQuery` operations across `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_routing`. For commodities, existing entries are deleted and re-inserted.
    *   Generates new `agent_booking_id` for creation.
    *   Implements error handling with `HttpError` and transaction rollbacks.
*   **`createDescXml` Function:** This function orchestrates the generation of ISF XML.
    *   It performs checks to prevent generating XML for already sent records or if XML was previously created (though a line checking for existing XML creation is commented out).
    *   It leverages `isfXmlGenerator` utility to create the XML using the `agent_booking_no` and `userId`.
*   **`uploadDescXml` Function:** (Code is truncated, but its declaration is present) This function is likely responsible for submitting the generated ISF XML.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **ISF-Centric Development:** All changes are deeply integrated with the Importer Security Filing process, covering its data models, storage, and external communication (XML).
*   **Database Interaction:** There's a strong reliance on database operations (select, insert, update, delete) and transaction management, with `agent_booking_id` serving as a primary key across multiple related tables.
*   **Status Lifecycle:** The introduction of `ISFStatus` and `ISFCNGStatus` enums, coupled with logic in `createEdit` and `createDescXml` to manage these statuses, highlights a focus on tracking the state of ISF submissions.
*   **XML Generation and Processing:** Dedicated utilities and controller functions (`isfXmlGenerator`, `isfDescXmlUpload`, `cngISFXmlGenerate`) are used for generating and handling XML files, which is a critical part of ISF compliance.
*   **Auditability:** The consistent use of an `AuditModule` underscores the requirement to track changes and actions related to ISF records.
*   **Detailed Data Management:** The sheer volume of fields defined in the controller and the granular types in `isf.types.ts` indicate a need to capture and manage a comprehensive set of information for each ISF entry, including complex party and address details.
