# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

## 10:46:42 AM
The provided log details a series of focused updates to a frontend application related to an "ISF Dashboard" feature, all occurring on October 7, 2025, between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:43:45 AM)**
    *   This file, which defines the column structure for the ISF Dashboard, underwent significant refactoring and expansion.
    *   Many new Material-UI icons (`AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) were imported, indicating a shift towards more visual status indicators.
    *   `minWidth` properties were added to most columns (`agent_booking_id`, `mbl_bl_no`, `etd`, `importer_name`, `isf_status`, `xml_sent_date`, `batch_created_by`, `transaction_id`, `cbp_status`, `cbp_errors`, `remarks`, `cng_xml_sent_date`, `location`, `lastmodifieddate`).
    *   The `isf_status` column was updated to render a `Chip` component, color-coded based on the status (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`) and displaying an `AdjustOutlinedIcon`.
    *   The `cbp_status` column also adopted a `Chip` renderer, using `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon` for 'Accepted' and `ErrorOutlineIcon` for 'ERROR', with corresponding color-coding.
    *   The `remarks` column, representing 'BOL Status', was enhanced to display a color-coded `Chip` with a `TagOutlinedIcon`, formatting "NO BILL MATCH (NOT ON FILE)" to "NOT MATCHED".
    *   New columns were introduced for 'CNG ISF Sent Date' (`cng_xml_sent_date`), 'Origin Office' (`location`), and 'Last Modified Date' (`lastmodifieddate`), all utilizing `appDateFormat` for display.
    *   The 'Action' column was moved to the end of the column definitions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:45:03 AM)**
    *   A minor but notable change in this subsequent update to the same file.
    *   The `mbl_bl_no` column's `headerName` was changed from '12 #' to 'Bill of Lading #'.
    *   The 'Action' column, which was at the end in the previous version, was moved to the very beginning of the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:46:20 AM)**
    *   This component, responsible for the ISF Dashboard user interface, received functional and UI enhancements.
    *   A `useEffect` hook was added to automatically `refetch` dashboard data if a `redirectState` indicates a 'saved' operation, suggesting integration with a save-and-redirect workflow.
    *   The `renderCell` property for the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` (specifically the 'Action' column, which was moved to the start) was dynamically set to `GridActions`, providing interactive actions defined by `getISFActions`.
    *   A refresh button (`IconButton` with `CachedIcon`) was added to the `CardHeader`, allowing users to manually refresh the dashboard data.
    *   The `ThemedGrid` component now includes `rowHeight={40}` and disables column menu and sorting features (`disableColumnMenu`, `disableColumnSorting`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Unified Development Session:** All changes were logged within a three-minute window on the same date, indicating a concentrated effort on the ISF Dashboard feature.
*   **Emphasis on UI/UX:** Extensive use of Material-UI components (Chips, Icons, Box, Stack, Card) and specific styling properties (`minWidth`, `color`, `variant`) points to a strong focus on improving the visual presentation and user experience of the dashboard.
*   **Visual Status Representation:** A consistent pattern of using `Chip` components with color-coding and relevant icons (e.g., `AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) is applied across multiple columns to clearly convey statuses like ISF status, CBP response, and BOL status.
*   **Date Formatting Consistency:** The `appDateFormat` utility is repeatedly used for displaying date fields across various columns, ensuring a uniform date format throughout the dashboard.
*   **Data Grid Enhancements:** The `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array is central to the data display, and its continuous refinement, along with the `ThemedGrid` props, demonstrates ongoing work on the dashboard's table functionality.
*   **State Management and Data Fetching:** The use of `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and `RTK Query` (`useFetchIsfDashboardQuery`, `refetch`) indicates a modern and centralized approach to application state and data fetching.

## 11:41:58 AM
The `get_auto_complete.controller.ts` file saw multiple updates within a short period, focusing on refining autocomplete search functionality. Initially, at 10/7/2025, 10:56:40 AM, it provided a broad range of autocomplete options for fields like `salesname`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shipper`, `agent`, `port`, `booking-shipper`, `scac`, `customer`, `getsku`, and `getVendor`. A key observation in this initial version was the construction of SQL queries for `booking-shipper`, which used `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '$1%'`, potentially indicating an incorrect parameterized query format or a direct string interpolation leading to a vulnerability. Search keywords for `booking-shipper` and `port` were wrapped with leading and trailing `%` wildcards.

The update at 10/7/2025, 10:59:16 AM, specifically addressed the `booking-shipper` search. The `search` variable's wildcard application was changed from `%${req.query.search}%` to `${req.query.search}%`, meaning the search became prefix-based (`LIKE term%` instead of `LIKE %term%`). Crucially, the corresponding SQL query was corrected to `LOWER(am.cname) ilike $1`, properly utilizing the parameterized query syntax and resolving the earlier potential vulnerability or misuse.

A subsequent change at 10/7/2025, 11:00:37 AM, applied a similar refinement to the `port` autocomplete search. Its `search` variable was also adjusted to use only a trailing wildcard (`${Searchquery.toLowerCase()}%`), shifting its behavior to prefix matching like the `booking-shipper` field. Throughout these changes to `get_auto_complete.controller.ts`, the `getVendor` case consistently appeared incomplete, ending abruptly.

At 10/7/2025, 11:10:26 AM, a new file, `isf.controller.ts`, was introduced, signifying a major new feature related to Importer Security Filing (ISF) management. This controller is responsible for handling ISF-related data. It defines a comprehensive list of fields for the `agent_booking_entry` table, indicating a complex data structure. Key functionalities include:
*   `fetchEdiPayload`: Retrieves detailed ISF data, including vessel, commodity, and routing information, processing dates for validity.
*   `createEdit`: Manages the creation and updating of ISF entries. This function incorporates robust transaction management (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), comprehensive auditing (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`), and handles associated data for vessels, routing, and commodity lists. It also checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` to maintain the correct `isf_status` during updates and supports a `draftFlag`.
*   `createDescXml`: Generates ISF XML descriptions, including checks to prevent re-sending already processed XML and utilizing an `isfXmlGenerator` utility.
*   `uploadDescXml`: Appears to be an incomplete function intended for uploading ISF XML.

Across both files, common patterns observed are extensive database interaction using `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions, and consistent error handling practices leveraging `try...catch` blocks that return `500 Internal server error` responses or utilize an `HttpError` module with `next()` for middleware error handling in the ISF controller. Logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`, `logger.warn`) is also frequently used for debugging and tracking execution flow.

## 11:46:45 AM
The log details changes made to several files related to an "ISF Dashboard" in a frontend application, specifically focusing on filtering and search functionalities. The changes span from `10/7/2025, 10:47:15 AM` to `10/7/2025, 11:41:26 AM`.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx`
- **10/7/2025, 10:47:15 AM**: This update to the `ISFDashboardScreen` component primarily involved the dashboard's query parameters. It expanded the `useFetchIsfDashboardQuery` to include various filtering criteria such as `batch_created_by`, `cbp_status`, `importer_name`, `ship_name`, `origin_office`, and `orderBy` (supporting both `sortModel` and `sortBy`). It also introduced an `useEffect` hook to refetch data when a `redirectState.operation` is 'saved'. The component's rendering of `GridActions` was adjusted to target the last column.
- **10/7/2025, 10:49:32 AM**: A minor but significant change was made here. The `GridActions` rendering was changed from targeting `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS.length - 1]` (the last column) to `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[0]` (the first column).

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashFilter.jsx`
- **10/7/2025, 11:02:59 AM**: This file was updated to define and manage filter categories for the ISF dashboard. It uses `react-redux` to access selected filters and dispatch actions (`toggleISFDashboardFilter`). A `filterConfig` array was introduced to dynamically render `FilterChipGroup` components for various categories like 'CBP Status', 'Office Origin', 'Fillers', 'Importers', and 'Shippers', mapping their options from `filterInfo`. It also imports and renders `ISFSearchForm`.

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`
This file saw the most frequent changes, primarily focused on enhancing the search form's input fields and dynamic option handling.
- **10/7/2025, 11:03:17 AM**: Initial setup of `ISFSearchForm` using `formik` for state management and `react-redux` for dispatching updates to `ISFDashboardInput`. It includes input boxes for 'MBL#12', 'BL#', 'SCAC', 'HTS#', along with 'reset' and 'apply' buttons.
- **10/7/2025, 11:03:27 AM**: Corrected a typo in an `InputBox` label from "MBL#12" to "MBL#".
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:24 AM**: Introduced new input fields for "Shipper", "Importer#", and "Delivery To #", expanding the search capabilities. The `id` attributes for "Shipper" and "Delivery To #" were incorrectly set to "scac" and "hts_no" respectively, overlapping with existing fields.
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:39 AM**: Adjusted the spacing for the "Delivery To #" input field by changing the parent `Stack`'s spacing prop from `3` to `2`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:51 AM**: Changed the "Delivery To #" input to be rendered directly within the main vertical `Stack` rather than an enclosed `Stack` with spacing.
- **10/7/2025, 11:05:22 AM**: Moved the "Delivery To #" input field to the bottom `Stack` alongside the 'reset' and 'apply' buttons.
- **10/7/2025, 11:05:53 AM**: Added a `className="w-full"` to the "Delivery To #" `InputBox`, likely for styling purposes.
- **10/7/2025, 11:06:05 AM**: Changed the `className` of the "Delivery To #" `InputBox` from "w-full" to "100px", indicating a size adjustment.
- **10/7/2025, 11:11:07 AM**: Expanded the `formik` `initialValues` and `handleReset` to include new fields: `ship_name`, `importer_name`, and `delivery_to_no`. However, the corresponding input boxes still use `scac` and `hts_no` as `id`s for these new labels.
- **10/7/2025, 11:15:13 AM**: Significant refactoring:
    - Introduced `useState` for `options` and `ApiManager` for fetching data.
    - Added `AppAutocomplete` component for "Supplier Name" (labeled as "Shipper Name" in later logs), allowing dynamic search for shippers via `handleOptionChange` and `handleValueChange` functions.
    - `handleOptionChange` fetches common options for "booking-shipper" from an API.
    - `handleValueChange` updates various `formik` fields (`ship_code`, `ship_add1`, etc.) based on the selected shipper.
- **10/7/2025, 11:18:43 AM**: Modified the `onChange` handler for `AppAutocomplete` to use `event.target.value` instead of the directly passed `value`, which suggests a change in how the `AppAutocomplete` component's `onChange` event is structured or interpreted.
- **10/7/2025, 11:21:06 AM**: Reverted the `AppAutocomplete` `onChange` handler to use `value?.cname || ''`, indicating the `AppAutocomplete` likely returns an object with a `cname` property for display. This correction fixes the previous change.
- **10/7/2025, 11:22:19 AM**: Refined the `AppAutocomplete` `onChange` handler to use `value?.cname || ''` specifically, ensuring the correct property is set in formik.
- **10/7/2025, 11:23:15 AM**: Changed the label of the `AppAutocomplete` from "Supplier Name" to "Shipper Name".
- **10/7/2025, 11:24:15 AM**: Added a `console.log("inputs====",inputs);` statement for debugging.
- **10/7/2025, 11:25:46 AM**: Modified `formik` `initialValues` to use `shipper` and `importer` as keys instead of `ship_name` and `importer_name`, though the actual input fields still reference the `ship_name` property. This indicates a potential mismatch or a change in naming convention that isn't fully propagated.
- **10/7/2025, 11:32:49 AM**: Major refactoring for state management of options:
    - Replaced `useState` for `options` with `useReducer` to manage various lists of options (e.g., `pol`, `pod`, `shipper`, `importer`).
    - The `dispatch` for `useReducer` is named `dispatch` in this version, which shadows the `useDispatch()` from `react-redux`.
    - The `handleOptionChange` now uses this `useReducer`'s `dispatch` to update specific option categories like `shipper`.
    - The `AppAutocomplete` options now correctly map `options.shipper`.
    - Commented out the original `handleOptionChange` using `useState`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:34:04 AM** / **10/7/2025, 11:34:11 AM** / **10/7/2025, 11:35:04 AM**: These entries show minimal changes, primarily related to `console.log` for debugging and slight re-indentation, but the core logic introduced at `11:32:49 AM` remains. The `useReducer` `dispatch` is still named `dispatch` here, which is problematic.
- **10/7/2025, 11:35:27 AM**: Added `console.log("options===",options)` for debugging the `useReducer` state.
- **10/7/2025, 11:37:20 AM**: Corrected the shadowing issue by explicitly naming the `useReducer`'s dispatch as `localDispatch` in the `useState` destructuring, however, it still uses `dispatch` for `useReducer`. This is still incorrect as `dispatch` is already taken by `useDispatch()`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:39:11 AM**: Further refined `useReducer` by removing unnecessary initial state fields, keeping only `shipper`, `importer`, and `consignee`. The `useReducer`'s dispatch is still ambiguously named `dispatch`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:41:26 AM**: Finally resolved the `dispatch` naming conflict by renaming the `useReducer`'s dispatch function to `localDispatch`. This ensures that `dispatch` refers to the Redux store dispatch, and `localDispatch` refers to the reducer's dispatch.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
- **Redux Integration**: The application heavily relies on `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management, particularly for ISF Dashboard data, pagination, sorting, and filter inputs.
- **Form Management**: `formik` is consistently used in `ISFSearchForm.jsx` for handling form state, input changes, and submission.
- **UI Components**: `@mui/material` components (Box, Card, Stack, IconButton, Button, InputBox, SelectBox) are widely used for building the user interface. Custom components like `ThemedBreadcrumb`, `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedGrid`, `GridSearchInput`, `FilterChipGroup`, and `AppAutocomplete` indicate a consistent component library approach.
- **API Interaction**: `ApiManager` is used for fetching data, specifically `getCommonOptions` for autocomplete functionalities.
- **Filtering and Search**: A significant focus is on implementing robust filtering and search mechanisms for the ISF Dashboard, including text inputs, dropdowns, and chip-based filters.
- **Debugging Statements**: Frequent `console.log` statements for `redirectState`, `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS.length`, `values` in `onSubmit`, `inputs`, and `options` indicate active development and debugging.
- **State Management Refinement**: There's a clear evolution in how dynamic options for autocomplete are managed, moving from simple `useState` to a more structured `useReducer` pattern to handle multiple categories of options. The naming of dispatch functions for `useReducer` was a recurring correction point.
- **Timestamp Pattern**: All changes occur on `10/7/2025`, indicating concentrated development effort on this specific feature within a single day. The timestamps are sequential and relatively close, suggesting iterative development and rapid bug fixing.

## 12:41:54 PM
The `BMQuery.ts` utility file, updated at **10/7/2025, 12:21:12 PM**, introduces a `BMQuery` class designed to generate SQL `SELECT` statements for retrieving various types of business partners. Each method (e.g., `getBuyer`, `getSeller`, `getImporter`, `getManufacturer`, `getConsignee`, `getBondHolder`, `getCustomBroker`) constructs a query targeting `agent_po_account_master` and `agent_po_account_master_type` tables. A recurring pattern across these queries is the use of `DISTINCT ON (am.cname)`, filtering by specific `atype` values, and performing a case-insensitive partial match on `am.cname` using `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '${this.keyword}%'`. Some queries also include additional joins or conditions, such as checking `cname` in `po_accountmaster_customer_master` or `account_master_shipper_map`.

The `isf.controller.ts` file saw significant changes at **10/7/2025, 12:30:44 PM** and **10/7/2025, 12:31:35 PM** (the latter being a duplicate entry of the former). These updates introduced a comprehensive list of fields for ISF (Importer Security Filing) data, including detailed address information for various parties, booking details, and new identification fields like `cnee_id_type`, `cnee_id_no`, `bond_holder_id_type`, `bond_holder_id_no`, `importer_id_type`, and `importer_id_no`. The `fetchEdiPayload` function was enhanced to retrieve consolidated ISF data, vessel information (handling mother/feeder vessels), commodity lists, and routing details. The `createEdit` function was refactored to support both creation and updates of ISF records within a transactional context, including audit logging, dynamic status updates (DRAFT, NEW, CREATED) based on existing `cng_xml_batchlog` entries, and management of associated vessel, routing, and commodity list data. The `createDescXml` function was also updated with checks to prevent duplicate XML generation if an ISF record is already marked as "Sent" or "Created."

Concurrently, the `isf.types.ts` file was updated at **10/7/2025, 12:30:54 PM** to define new and refined TypeScript types and interfaces crucial for ISF data. This includes `DataInput` with expanded fields for importer and shipment details, `Address` and `TempData` types that now incorporate `id_value`, `id_type`, and bond-related information. A new `ISFQueryType` interface was added for defining query parameters, and two key enums, `ISFStatus` (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`) and `ISFCNGStatus` (`NOT_SENT`, `SENT_TO_CNG`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`), were introduced to standardize and manage the lifecycle and communication status of ISF filings.

Overall, the changes highlight a concentrated effort to build out and refine the ISF functionality within the application. This includes robust data management, complex query generation, comprehensive status tracking, and audit logging. The proximity of the timestamps suggests these changes were part of a single, focused development push.

## 12:47:25 PM
The provided log details changes across two files related to an ISF (Importer Security Filing) dashboard in a React frontend application: `ISFSearchForm.jsx` and `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`.

### File: `src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`

This file handles the search form functionality for the ISF dashboard, integrating with Redux for state management and Formik for form handling.

*   **10/7/2025, 11:50:30 AM**: The initial state of the component includes basic input fields (MBL#, BL#, SCAC, HTS#) and an `AppAutocomplete` for "Shipper Name." A `useReducer` manages options for `shipper`, `importer`, and `consignee`. The `handleOptionChange` function was initially designed to fetch only "booking-shipper" options. A `handleValueChange` function was present to populate shipper details based on selection.
*   **10/7/2025, 11:51:16 AM**: An `AppAutocomplete` for "Importer Name" was added to the UI. However, its `handleOptionChange` callback still incorrectly pointed to the shipper-specific logic, implying it would attempt to fetch shipper data instead of importer data.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:01:16 PM**:
    *   The `BookingAtypeEnum` was imported, signaling an intent to generalize API endpoints.
    *   A significant refactoring attempt was made in `handleOptionChange` to use conditional logic (`if(shipper)`, `else if(importer)`, `else if(consignee)`) to determine the API endpoint dynamically. Critically, the variables `shipper`, `importer`, `consignee` inside this function were incorrectly assigned the return value of `localDispatch` (which is `undefined`), leading to a logical flaw where the conditional blocks would not execute as intended.
    *   The "Delivery To #" `InputBox` was replaced with an `AppAutocomplete` for "Delivery To," aimed at fetching consignee data (though still affected by the `handleOptionChange` bug).
*   **10/7/2025, 12:02:21 PM**: A minor bug fix was applied in `handleOptionChange`, adding nullish coalescing (`res?.data?.length`) to safely access nested properties, preventing potential runtime errors. The core logical flaw in determining the endpoint persisted.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:04:14 PM**:
    *   A major fix was implemented for `handleOptionChange`. It was updated to accept `field` as an argument (`async (field, query) => {...}`), correctly determining the API endpoint (`"booking-shipper"`, `BookingAtypeEnum.IMPORTER`, `BookingAtypeEnum.CONSIGNEE`) based on this `field`.
    *   The `AppAutocomplete` for "Shipper Name" was updated to correctly pass `"shipper"` as the `field` argument. However, "Importer Name" and "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` components were not yet updated to pass their respective `field` arguments, still using the generic `handleOptionChange(query)`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:05:34 PM**: Robustness improvements were added to `handleOptionChange`:
    *   A check `if (!query) return;` prevents API calls with empty queries.
    *   `.trim()` was added to the `searchQuery`.
    *   A `try...catch` block was wrapped around the `ApiManager.getCommonOptions` call for error handling.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:22:56 PM**: The `AppAutocomplete` components for "Importer Name" and "Delivery To" were finally updated to correctly pass their `field` arguments (`"importer"` and `"consignee"` respectively) to the `handleOptionChange` function, completing the generalization.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:24:11 PM**: An unused import `WidthFull` from `@mui/icons-material` was added. An incorrect styling attempt was made on the "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` using `WidthFull` in its `sx` prop.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:24:41 PM**: The styling for "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` was adjusted, changing `WidthFull` to `WidthFull: "100%"`, still an unconventional MUI styling approach.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:26:02 PM**: Styling for "Shipper Name" and "Importer Name" `AppAutocomplete` components was updated to use MUI's `mt`, `mb` spacing shorthands and `flex: 1` for equal width distribution within their `Stack`. The "Delivery To" field retained its `WidthFull: "100%"` style.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:26:25 PM**: The "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` styling was made consistent with the other autocomplete fields by changing its `sx` prop to `sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 1, flex: 1 }}`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:26:46 PM**: The `flex` property for "Delivery To" `AppAutocomplete` was changed from `flex: 1` to `flex: 2`. Given its placement, this might lead to unintended layout behavior.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:30:13 PM**: The `handleReset` function's `updateISFDashboardInput` payload was cleaned up, removing `delivery_to_no: ""`. The `handleValueChange` function, which was unused, was removed.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:35:07 PM**: Further code cleanup occurred with the removal of the unused `useState` import and the previously unused `WidthFull` import.

**Patterns in `ISFSearchForm.jsx`**: A clear iterative development process is observed, starting with basic functionality, then gradually generalizing and fixing the autocomplete logic for different entity types (shipper, importer, consignee). This involved several steps to correctly pass parameters and handle API calls, followed by styling refinements and general code cleanup.

### File: `src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`

This file is responsible for the header section of the ISF dashboard, including search, filters, and display of ISF templates.

*   **10/7/2025, 12:37:47 PM**: The component structure includes a `ScreenToolbar` with a text field for "Bill of Lading" search and `SelectBox` components for "Shipper" and "Importer" filters. It fetches ISF templates using `useGetTemplateQuery` and displays them as `BoxItem` components, including a "New ISF" option. Filtering logic for `filteredData`, `uniqueShippers`, and `uniqueImporters` is implemented using `useMemo`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:38:01 PM**: A minor textual change was made: `title="New ISF1"` was updated to `title="New ISF"` for the "New ISF" template box.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:38:24 PM**: A typo was corrected in the "New ISF" template box's subtitle, changing `subtitle="Create from scratch"ddd` to `subtitle="Create from scratch"`.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:38:39 PM**: No functional changes. The code is identical to the previous entry, likely an automatic save.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:40:42 PM**: A minor textual change was made within the `BoxItem` component, changing the shipper label from `Shipper:` to `Shipper:1`. This appears to be a small placeholder or debugging change.
*   **10/7/2025, 12:40:56 PM**: No functional changes. The code is identical to the previous entry, likely an automatic save.

**Patterns in `ISFDashboardHeader.jsx`**: The changes in this file are predominantly minor textual adjustments and typo corrections within the display elements. There are no significant functional or structural updates beyond the initial implementation shown. Multiple consecutive entries are identical, indicating frequent, possibly automated, saves without code modification.
