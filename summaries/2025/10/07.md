# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

## 10:46:42 AM
The provided log details a series of focused updates to a frontend application related to an "ISF Dashboard" feature, all occurring on October 7, 2025, between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:43:45 AM)**
    *   This file, which defines the column structure for the ISF Dashboard, underwent significant refactoring and expansion.
    *   Many new Material-UI icons (`AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) were imported, indicating a shift towards more visual status indicators.
    *   `minWidth` properties were added to most columns (`agent_booking_id`, `mbl_bl_no`, `etd`, `importer_name`, `isf_status`, `xml_sent_date`, `batch_created_by`, `transaction_id`, `cbp_status`, `cbp_errors`, `remarks`, `cng_xml_sent_date`, `location`, `lastmodifieddate`).
    *   The `isf_status` column was updated to render a `Chip` component, color-coded based on the status (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`) and displaying an `AdjustOutlinedIcon`.
    *   The `cbp_status` column also adopted a `Chip` renderer, using `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon` for 'Accepted' and `ErrorOutlineIcon` for 'ERROR', with corresponding color-coding.
    *   The `remarks` column, representing 'BOL Status', was enhanced to display a color-coded `Chip` with a `TagOutlinedIcon`, formatting "NO BILL MATCH (NOT ON FILE)" to "NOT MATCHED".
    *   New columns were introduced for 'CNG ISF Sent Date' (`cng_xml_sent_date`), 'Origin Office' (`location`), and 'Last Modified Date' (`lastmodifieddate`), all utilizing `appDateFormat` for display.
    *   The 'Action' column was moved to the end of the column definitions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:45:03 AM)**
    *   A minor but notable change in this subsequent update to the same file.
    *   The `mbl_bl_no` column's `headerName` was changed from '12 #' to 'Bill of Lading #'.
    *   The 'Action' column, which was at the end in the previous version, was moved to the very beginning of the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:46:20 AM)**
    *   This component, responsible for the ISF Dashboard user interface, received functional and UI enhancements.
    *   A `useEffect` hook was added to automatically `refetch` dashboard data if a `redirectState` indicates a 'saved' operation, suggesting integration with a save-and-redirect workflow.
    *   The `renderCell` property for the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` (specifically the 'Action' column, which was moved to the start) was dynamically set to `GridActions`, providing interactive actions defined by `getISFActions`.
    *   A refresh button (`IconButton` with `CachedIcon`) was added to the `CardHeader`, allowing users to manually refresh the dashboard data.
    *   The `ThemedGrid` component now includes `rowHeight={40}` and disables column menu and sorting features (`disableColumnMenu`, `disableColumnSorting`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Unified Development Session:** All changes were logged within a three-minute window on the same date, indicating a concentrated effort on the ISF Dashboard feature.
*   **Emphasis on UI/UX:** Extensive use of Material-UI components (Chips, Icons, Box, Stack, Card) and specific styling properties (`minWidth`, `color`, `variant`) points to a strong focus on improving the visual presentation and user experience of the dashboard.
*   **Visual Status Representation:** A consistent pattern of using `Chip` components with color-coding and relevant icons (e.g., `AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) is applied across multiple columns to clearly convey statuses like ISF status, CBP response, and BOL status.
*   **Date Formatting Consistency:** The `appDateFormat` utility is repeatedly used for displaying date fields across various columns, ensuring a uniform date format throughout the dashboard.
*   **Data Grid Enhancements:** The `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array is central to the data display, and its continuous refinement, along with the `ThemedGrid` props, demonstrates ongoing work on the dashboard's table functionality.
*   **State Management and Data Fetching:** The use of `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and `RTK Query` (`useFetchIsfDashboardQuery`, `refetch`) indicates a modern and centralized approach to application state and data fetching.

## 11:41:58 AM
The `get_auto_complete.controller.ts` file saw multiple updates within a short period, focusing on refining autocomplete search functionality. Initially, at 10/7/2025, 10:56:40 AM, it provided a broad range of autocomplete options for fields like `salesname`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shipper`, `agent`, `port`, `booking-shipper`, `scac`, `customer`, `getsku`, and `getVendor`. A key observation in this initial version was the construction of SQL queries for `booking-shipper`, which used `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '$1%'`, potentially indicating an incorrect parameterized query format or a direct string interpolation leading to a vulnerability. Search keywords for `booking-shipper` and `port` were wrapped with leading and trailing `%` wildcards.

The update at 10/7/2025, 10:59:16 AM, specifically addressed the `booking-shipper` search. The `search` variable's wildcard application was changed from `%${req.query.search}%` to `${req.query.search}%`, meaning the search became prefix-based (`LIKE term%` instead of `LIKE %term%`). Crucially, the corresponding SQL query was corrected to `LOWER(am.cname) ilike $1`, properly utilizing the parameterized query syntax and resolving the earlier potential vulnerability or misuse.

A subsequent change at 10/7/2025, 11:00:37 AM, applied a similar refinement to the `port` autocomplete search. Its `search` variable was also adjusted to use only a trailing wildcard (`${Searchquery.toLowerCase()}%`), shifting its behavior to prefix matching like the `booking-shipper` field. Throughout these changes to `get_auto_complete.controller.ts`, the `getVendor` case consistently appeared incomplete, ending abruptly.

At 10/7/2025, 11:10:26 AM, a new file, `isf.controller.ts`, was introduced, signifying a major new feature related to Importer Security Filing (ISF) management. This controller is responsible for handling ISF-related data. It defines a comprehensive list of fields for the `agent_booking_entry` table, indicating a complex data structure. Key functionalities include:
*   `fetchEdiPayload`: Retrieves detailed ISF data, including vessel, commodity, and routing information, processing dates for validity.
*   `createEdit`: Manages the creation and updating of ISF entries. This function incorporates robust transaction management (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), comprehensive auditing (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`), and handles associated data for vessels, routing, and commodity lists. It also checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` to maintain the correct `isf_status` during updates and supports a `draftFlag`.
*   `createDescXml`: Generates ISF XML descriptions, including checks to prevent re-sending already processed XML and utilizing an `isfXmlGenerator` utility.
*   `uploadDescXml`: Appears to be an incomplete function intended for uploading ISF XML.

Across both files, common patterns observed are extensive database interaction using `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions, and consistent error handling practices leveraging `try...catch` blocks that return `500 Internal server error` responses or utilize an `HttpError` module with `next()` for middleware error handling in the ISF controller. Logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`, `logger.warn`) is also frequently used for debugging and tracking execution flow.
