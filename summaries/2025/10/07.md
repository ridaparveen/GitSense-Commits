# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

## 10:46:42 AM
The provided log details a series of focused updates to a frontend application related to an "ISF Dashboard" feature, all occurring on October 7, 2025, between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:43:45 AM)**
    *   This file, which defines the column structure for the ISF Dashboard, underwent significant refactoring and expansion.
    *   Many new Material-UI icons (`AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) were imported, indicating a shift towards more visual status indicators.
    *   `minWidth` properties were added to most columns (`agent_booking_id`, `mbl_bl_no`, `etd`, `importer_name`, `isf_status`, `xml_sent_date`, `batch_created_by`, `transaction_id`, `cbp_status`, `cbp_errors`, `remarks`, `cng_xml_sent_date`, `location`, `lastmodifieddate`).
    *   The `isf_status` column was updated to render a `Chip` component, color-coded based on the status (`DRAFT`, `NEW`, `CREATED`, `FAILED_TO_SEND`, `SENT`) and displaying an `AdjustOutlinedIcon`.
    *   The `cbp_status` column also adopted a `Chip` renderer, using `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon` for 'Accepted' and `ErrorOutlineIcon` for 'ERROR', with corresponding color-coding.
    *   The `remarks` column, representing 'BOL Status', was enhanced to display a color-coded `Chip` with a `TagOutlinedIcon`, formatting "NO BILL MATCH (NOT ON FILE)" to "NOT MATCHED".
    *   New columns were introduced for 'CNG ISF Sent Date' (`cng_xml_sent_date`), 'Origin Office' (`location`), and 'Last Modified Date' (`lastmodifieddate`), all utilizing `appDateFormat` for display.
    *   The 'Action' column was moved to the end of the column definitions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:45:03 AM)**
    *   A minor but notable change in this subsequent update to the same file.
    *   The `mbl_bl_no` column's `headerName` was changed from '12 #' to 'Bill of Lading #'.
    *   The 'Action' column, which was at the end in the previous version, was moved to the very beginning of the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/7/2025, 10:46:20 AM)**
    *   This component, responsible for the ISF Dashboard user interface, received functional and UI enhancements.
    *   A `useEffect` hook was added to automatically `refetch` dashboard data if a `redirectState` indicates a 'saved' operation, suggesting integration with a save-and-redirect workflow.
    *   The `renderCell` property for the `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` (specifically the 'Action' column, which was moved to the start) was dynamically set to `GridActions`, providing interactive actions defined by `getISFActions`.
    *   A refresh button (`IconButton` with `CachedIcon`) was added to the `CardHeader`, allowing users to manually refresh the dashboard data.
    *   The `ThemedGrid` component now includes `rowHeight={40}` and disables column menu and sorting features (`disableColumnMenu`, `disableColumnSorting`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Unified Development Session:** All changes were logged within a three-minute window on the same date, indicating a concentrated effort on the ISF Dashboard feature.
*   **Emphasis on UI/UX:** Extensive use of Material-UI components (Chips, Icons, Box, Stack, Card) and specific styling properties (`minWidth`, `color`, `variant`) points to a strong focus on improving the visual presentation and user experience of the dashboard.
*   **Visual Status Representation:** A consistent pattern of using `Chip` components with color-coding and relevant icons (e.g., `AdjustOutlinedIcon`, `CheckCircleOutlineOutlinedIcon`, `ErrorOutlineIcon`, `TagOutlinedIcon`) is applied across multiple columns to clearly convey statuses like ISF status, CBP response, and BOL status.
*   **Date Formatting Consistency:** The `appDateFormat` utility is repeatedly used for displaying date fields across various columns, ensuring a uniform date format throughout the dashboard.
*   **Data Grid Enhancements:** The `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` array is central to the data display, and its continuous refinement, along with the `ThemedGrid` props, demonstrates ongoing work on the dashboard's table functionality.
*   **State Management and Data Fetching:** The use of `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and `RTK Query` (`useFetchIsfDashboardQuery`, `refetch`) indicates a modern and centralized approach to application state and data fetching.

## 11:41:58 AM
The `get_auto_complete.controller.ts` file saw multiple updates within a short period, focusing on refining autocomplete search functionality. Initially, at 10/7/2025, 10:56:40 AM, it provided a broad range of autocomplete options for fields like `salesname`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shipper`, `agent`, `port`, `booking-shipper`, `scac`, `customer`, `getsku`, and `getVendor`. A key observation in this initial version was the construction of SQL queries for `booking-shipper`, which used `LOWER(am.cname) ilike '$1%'`, potentially indicating an incorrect parameterized query format or a direct string interpolation leading to a vulnerability. Search keywords for `booking-shipper` and `port` were wrapped with leading and trailing `%` wildcards.

The update at 10/7/2025, 10:59:16 AM, specifically addressed the `booking-shipper` search. The `search` variable's wildcard application was changed from `%${req.query.search}%` to `${req.query.search}%`, meaning the search became prefix-based (`LIKE term%` instead of `LIKE %term%`). Crucially, the corresponding SQL query was corrected to `LOWER(am.cname) ilike $1`, properly utilizing the parameterized query syntax and resolving the earlier potential vulnerability or misuse.

A subsequent change at 10/7/2025, 11:00:37 AM, applied a similar refinement to the `port` autocomplete search. Its `search` variable was also adjusted to use only a trailing wildcard (`${Searchquery.toLowerCase()}%`), shifting its behavior to prefix matching like the `booking-shipper` field. Throughout these changes to `get_auto_complete.controller.ts`, the `getVendor` case consistently appeared incomplete, ending abruptly.

At 10/7/2025, 11:10:26 AM, a new file, `isf.controller.ts`, was introduced, signifying a major new feature related to Importer Security Filing (ISF) management. This controller is responsible for handling ISF-related data. It defines a comprehensive list of fields for the `agent_booking_entry` table, indicating a complex data structure. Key functionalities include:
*   `fetchEdiPayload`: Retrieves detailed ISF data, including vessel, commodity, and routing information, processing dates for validity.
*   `createEdit`: Manages the creation and updating of ISF entries. This function incorporates robust transaction management (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), comprehensive auditing (`insertAudit`, `simpleAudit`), and handles associated data for vessels, routing, and commodity lists. It also checks the `cng_xml_batchlog` to maintain the correct `isf_status` during updates and supports a `draftFlag`.
*   `createDescXml`: Generates ISF XML descriptions, including checks to prevent re-sending already processed XML and utilizing an `isfXmlGenerator` utility.
*   `uploadDescXml`: Appears to be an incomplete function intended for uploading ISF XML.

Across both files, common patterns observed are extensive database interaction using `query`, `insertQuery`, and `updateQuery` functions, and consistent error handling practices leveraging `try...catch` blocks that return `500 Internal server error` responses or utilize an `HttpError` module with `next()` for middleware error handling in the ISF controller. Logging (`logger.info`, `logger.error`, `logger.warn`) is also frequently used for debugging and tracking execution flow.

## 11:46:45 AM
The log details changes made to several files related to an "ISF Dashboard" in a frontend application, specifically focusing on filtering and search functionalities. The changes span from `10/7/2025, 10:47:15 AM` to `10/7/2025, 11:41:26 AM`.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\isf-dashboard\ISFDashboardScreen.jsx`
- **10/7/2025, 10:47:15 AM**: This update to the `ISFDashboardScreen` component primarily involved the dashboard's query parameters. It expanded the `useFetchIsfDashboardQuery` to include various filtering criteria such as `batch_created_by`, `cbp_status`, `importer_name`, `ship_name`, `origin_office`, and `orderBy` (supporting both `sortModel` and `sortBy`). It also introduced an `useEffect` hook to refetch data when a `redirectState.operation` is 'saved'. The component's rendering of `GridActions` was adjusted to target the last column.
- **10/7/2025, 10:49:32 AM**: A minor but significant change was made here. The `GridActions` rendering was changed from targeting `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS.length - 1]` (the last column) to `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS[0]` (the first column).

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFDashFilter.jsx`
- **10/7/2025, 11:02:59 AM**: This file was updated to define and manage filter categories for the ISF dashboard. It uses `react-redux` to access selected filters and dispatch actions (`toggleISFDashboardFilter`). A `filterConfig` array was introduced to dynamically render `FilterChipGroup` components for various categories like 'CBP Status', 'Office Origin', 'Fillers', 'Importers', and 'Shippers', mapping their options from `filterInfo`. It also imports and renders `ISFSearchForm`.

#### `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\isf-dashboard\ISFSearchForm.jsx`
This file saw the most frequent changes, primarily focused on enhancing the search form's input fields and dynamic option handling.
- **10/7/2025, 11:03:17 AM**: Initial setup of `ISFSearchForm` using `formik` for state management and `react-redux` for dispatching updates to `ISFDashboardInput`. It includes input boxes for 'MBL#12', 'BL#', 'SCAC', 'HTS#', along with 'reset' and 'apply' buttons.
- **10/7/2025, 11:03:27 AM**: Corrected a typo in an `InputBox` label from "MBL#12" to "MBL#".
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:24 AM**: Introduced new input fields for "Shipper", "Importer#", and "Delivery To #", expanding the search capabilities. The `id` attributes for "Shipper" and "Delivery To #" were incorrectly set to "scac" and "hts_no" respectively, overlapping with existing fields.
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:39 AM**: Adjusted the spacing for the "Delivery To #" input field by changing the parent `Stack`'s spacing prop from `3` to `2`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:04:51 AM**: Changed the "Delivery To #" input to be rendered directly within the main vertical `Stack` rather than an enclosed `Stack` with spacing.
- **10/7/2025, 11:05:22 AM**: Moved the "Delivery To #" input field to the bottom `Stack` alongside the 'reset' and 'apply' buttons.
- **10/7/2025, 11:05:53 AM**: Added a `className="w-full"` to the "Delivery To #" `InputBox`, likely for styling purposes.
- **10/7/2025, 11:06:05 AM**: Changed the `className` of the "Delivery To #" `InputBox` from "w-full" to "100px", indicating a size adjustment.
- **10/7/2025, 11:11:07 AM**: Expanded the `formik` `initialValues` and `handleReset` to include new fields: `ship_name`, `importer_name`, and `delivery_to_no`. However, the corresponding input boxes still use `scac` and `hts_no` as `id`s for these new labels.
- **10/7/2025, 11:15:13 AM**: Significant refactoring:
    - Introduced `useState` for `options` and `ApiManager` for fetching data.
    - Added `AppAutocomplete` component for "Supplier Name" (labeled as "Shipper Name" in later logs), allowing dynamic search for shippers via `handleOptionChange` and `handleValueChange` functions.
    - `handleOptionChange` fetches common options for "booking-shipper" from an API.
    - `handleValueChange` updates various `formik` fields (`ship_code`, `ship_add1`, etc.) based on the selected shipper.
- **10/7/2025, 11:18:43 AM**: Modified the `onChange` handler for `AppAutocomplete` to use `event.target.value` instead of the directly passed `value`, which suggests a change in how the `AppAutocomplete` component's `onChange` event is structured or interpreted.
- **10/7/2025, 11:21:06 AM**: Reverted the `AppAutocomplete` `onChange` handler to use `value?.cname || ''`, indicating the `AppAutocomplete` likely returns an object with a `cname` property for display. This correction fixes the previous change.
- **10/7/2025, 11:22:19 AM**: Refined the `AppAutocomplete` `onChange` handler to use `value?.cname || ''` specifically, ensuring the correct property is set in formik.
- **10/7/2025, 11:23:15 AM**: Changed the label of the `AppAutocomplete` from "Supplier Name" to "Shipper Name".
- **10/7/2025, 11:24:15 AM**: Added a `console.log("inputs====",inputs);` statement for debugging.
- **10/7/2025, 11:25:46 AM**: Modified `formik` `initialValues` to use `shipper` and `importer` as keys instead of `ship_name` and `importer_name`, though the actual input fields still reference the `ship_name` property. This indicates a potential mismatch or a change in naming convention that isn't fully propagated.
- **10/7/2025, 11:32:49 AM**: Major refactoring for state management of options:
    - Replaced `useState` for `options` with `useReducer` to manage various lists of options (e.g., `pol`, `pod`, `shipper`, `importer`).
    - The `dispatch` for `useReducer` is named `dispatch` in this version, which shadows the `useDispatch()` from `react-redux`.
    - The `handleOptionChange` now uses this `useReducer`'s `dispatch` to update specific option categories like `shipper`.
    - The `AppAutocomplete` options now correctly map `options.shipper`.
    - Commented out the original `handleOptionChange` using `useState`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:34:04 AM** / **10/7/2025, 11:34:11 AM** / **10/7/2025, 11:35:04 AM**: These entries show minimal changes, primarily related to `console.log` for debugging and slight re-indentation, but the core logic introduced at `11:32:49 AM` remains. The `useReducer` `dispatch` is still named `dispatch` here, which is problematic.
- **10/7/2025, 11:35:27 AM**: Added `console.log("options===",options)` for debugging the `useReducer` state.
- **10/7/2025, 11:37:20 AM**: Corrected the shadowing issue by explicitly naming the `useReducer`'s dispatch as `localDispatch` in the `useState` destructuring, however, it still uses `dispatch` for `useReducer`. This is still incorrect as `dispatch` is already taken by `useDispatch()`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:39:11 AM**: Further refined `useReducer` by removing unnecessary initial state fields, keeping only `shipper`, `importer`, and `consignee`. The `useReducer`'s dispatch is still ambiguously named `dispatch`.
- **10/7/2025, 11:41:26 AM**: Finally resolved the `dispatch` naming conflict by renaming the `useReducer`'s dispatch function to `localDispatch`. This ensures that `dispatch` refers to the Redux store dispatch, and `localDispatch` refers to the reducer's dispatch.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
- **Redux Integration**: The application heavily relies on `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management, particularly for ISF Dashboard data, pagination, sorting, and filter inputs.
- **Form Management**: `formik` is consistently used in `ISFSearchForm.jsx` for handling form state, input changes, and submission.
- **UI Components**: `@mui/material` components (Box, Card, Stack, IconButton, Button, InputBox, SelectBox) are widely used for building the user interface. Custom components like `ThemedBreadcrumb`, `ScreenToolbar`, `ThemedGrid`, `GridSearchInput`, `FilterChipGroup`, and `AppAutocomplete` indicate a consistent component library approach.
- **API Interaction**: `ApiManager` is used for fetching data, specifically `getCommonOptions` for autocomplete functionalities.
- **Filtering and Search**: A significant focus is on implementing robust filtering and search mechanisms for the ISF Dashboard, including text inputs, dropdowns, and chip-based filters.
- **Debugging Statements**: Frequent `console.log` statements for `redirectState`, `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS.length`, `values` in `onSubmit`, `inputs`, and `options` indicate active development and debugging.
- **State Management Refinement**: There's a clear evolution in how dynamic options for autocomplete are managed, moving from simple `useState` to a more structured `useReducer` pattern to handle multiple categories of options. The naming of dispatch functions for `useReducer` was a recurring correction point.
- **Timestamp Pattern**: All changes occur on `10/7/2025`, indicating concentrated development effort on this specific feature within a single day. The timestamps are sequential and relatively close, suggesting iterative development and rapid bug fixing.
