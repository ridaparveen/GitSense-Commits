# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 10:49:53 AM
The provided log details changes across three files within an analytics backend system, primarily focusing on query generation and data export functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts` (Timestamp: 10/29/2025, 1:17:31 PM):**
    *   This file, responsible for fetching table data reports, has undergone significant expansion. The `getTableDataReports` function now includes a much larger `else if` block to handle numerous new `type` values related to `booking` and `cargo-ready` analytics. These new types include various calculations of time differences between dates (e.g., `BookingDatetoActualDeparture`, `BookingDatetoCargoReady`, `CargoReadyDatetoEstDepartureDate`) and their "MblWise" and "StackedBar" counterparts.
    *   Previously commented-out code for `ContainerShippedMblWise` using `mblQueryBuilder` is now fully removed, indicating a shift in how this specific report type is handled or a consolidation into other query builders.
    *   The `mainQuery` logging now includes the `type` parameter for better debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts` (Multiple timestamps from 10/29/2025, 1:36:20 PM to 10/29/2025, 9:34:16 PM):**
    *   This controller handles data export. A key change is the modification of the `mblWiseQuery` construction. Initially, the `DISTINCT ON` clause for non-MBL wise queries specifically referenced `t49_cont_type` and `cont_type` without the `m.` alias. Later updates (1:41:44 PM) prefixed these with `m.`, indicating a correction to ensure the correct table column is referenced.
    *   Around 1:41:44 PM, error handling in the `catch` block was updated to include `error.message`.
    *   There were several identical updates around 6:00 PM, primarily adding more `console.log` statements for debugging `mblWiseQuery`, `COLUMNS`, and `customQuery` within the `if(isBooking)` block.
    *   A significant fix was introduced at 6:26:45 PM to correctly structure the `mainQuery` for booking-related exports. It now explicitly checks if `customQuery` already contains a `WHERE` clause to appropriately prepend `AND` or `WHERE` for date filtering, preventing SQL syntax errors.
    *   A major update at 10/29/2025, 9:33:01 PM introduces special handling for the "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)" report within the `if(isBooking)` block. This report now generates an aggregated query using a `WITH` clause to first select distinct MBLs with their `final_delivery_date` and `quarter`, then aggregates these results by month and quarter, counting distinct MBLs. This means this specific report type bypasses the general `SELECT ${mblWiseQuery} ${COLUMNS} ${customQuery}` structure.
    *   The `replaceColumnHandler` function consistently maps 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' for both `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields across all versions of this file.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\export.query.ts` (Multiple timestamps from 10/29/2025, 1:52:59 PM to 10/30/2025, 12:29:19 AM):**
    *   This file defines SQL query snippets for various analytics reports.
    *   Early changes expanded the `query` object with new report types, including "Booking Date to POD Arrival" and its MBL-wise counterpart.
    *   The "Container Shipped (MBL Wise)" report's SQL query evolved significantly. Initially, it was a simple `SELECT` statement (9:02:36 PM). Later, it was restructured (9:10:49 PM) to include `final_delivery_date` and `quarter` calculations based on `delivery_customer_date` or `updated_inland_arv_date`.
    *   Further refinement for "Containers Shipped (MBL Wise)" (9:23:10 PM) converted it into an aggregated query. It now selects `month` and calculates counts for "This Quarter" and "Last Quarter" based on a subquery that determines `final_delivery_date` and `quarter` for each MBL. This version uses `DATE_TRUNC('month', final_delivery_date)` for grouping and ordering.
    *   At 12:05:05 AM (10/30/2025), the "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)" query was refined again to format the month as 'Mon ''YY' and to calculate 'This Quarter' and 'Last Quarter' based on relative time intervals from `CURRENT_DATE`. It also directly counts distinct MBLs within this aggregated query, simplifying the subquery structure in comparison to the 9:23:10 PM version.
    *   Finally, the query for "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)" was reverted back to a detailed `SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ON ...)` structure with calculated `final_delivery_date`, `month`, and `quarter` fields within the main select, and removed the outer aggregation logic (12:07:29 AM, 12:22:35 AM). It appears there was an attempt to simplify or modify the aggregation but it was later reverted or combined with the main query directly for columns. The very last change (12:28:49 AM, 12:29:19 AM) appears to be a reformatting and slight adjustment to the previous version, focusing on the `CASE WHEN` logic for `quarter` calculation and ensuring correct aliases.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\booking.query.ts` (Multiple timestamps from 10/29/2025, 2:06:58 PM to 10/30/2025, 10:48:56 AM):**
    *   This file defines SQL query builders for booking-related analytics reports. The `bookingQueryBuilder` function contains extensive `if-else if` logic to generate specific SQL queries based on the `type` parameter.
    *   Multiple identical changes are recorded for this file across several timestamps (e.g., 2:15:12 PM, 2:16:08 PM, 2:45:45 PM, and many subsequent identical timestamps up to 10/30/2025, 10:48:56 AM). These identical entries suggest repeated saves without functional changes to the displayed code segment, or minor non-functional changes not captured in the snippet. The constant content for these timestamps focuses on queries for:
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDeparture` (average day difference between dates, non-MBL wise).
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWise` (average day difference between dates, MBL wise).
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDepartureStackedBar` (stacked bar chart data, non-MBL wise, categorizing time differences into 'Less than 1 week', '1 - 2 weeks', etc.).
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWiseStackedBar` (stacked bar chart data, MBL wise).
    *   The structure for these queries consistently includes `DISTINCT ON (m.voyage,m.contno, CASE WHEN m.t49_cont_type IS NOT NULL ... ELSE m.cont_type END)` for non-MBL wise reports, and `DISTINCT ON (LOWER(m.mblno))` for MBL-wise reports, ensuring uniqueness based on container or MBL.
    *   All queries filter by `account_name` (CompanyName) and a date range (`departure_date >= '${fromDate}'::timestamp AND departure_date < '${toDate}'::timestamp + INTERVAL '1 day'`).
    *   The `customizer` object is consistently updated with `dateRange`, `calType`, `dateColumns`, `booking`, `mblwise`, `chartType`, and `calColumnConfig` based on the report type.
    *   The `getColumnsByCategory` utility function is used to dynamically select columns, ignoring `country_name`, `networkdays`, `bl_release_date` but always including `bookingdate`, `booking_status_action_date`, `est_cargo_ready_date`, `departure_date`.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   **Analytics Context:** All changes are within an "analytics" module, indicating a continuous development cycle for reporting and data analysis features.
*   **Timestamp Pattern:** All timestamps fall on `10/29/2025` or `10/30/2025`, suggesting a focused development effort over these two days.
*   **Database Interaction:** The `query` function (presumably from `../../config/database`) is central to fetching data in all controllers. SQL queries are dynamically constructed using template literals and injected parameters.
*   **Date Handling:** A `defaultDateRange` utility is used if `fromDate` or `toDate` are missing. Date comparison and extraction (e.g., `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)`, `DATE_PART('day', ...)`, `DATE_TRUNC`) are common in the SQL queries.
*   **Company and User Specificity:** Queries consistently filter by `CompanyName` and `user_id` obtained via `getUserObject`, ensuring data segregation based on user and company.
*   **Report Type Driven Logic:** The `type` parameter (e.g., `'BookingDatetoActualDeparture'`, `'Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)'`) dictates the specific SQL query and customizer configurations. This pattern is prominent in both `others.controller.ts` and `booking.query.ts`.
*   **"MBL Wise" and "Stacked Bar" Variations:** Many report types have "MBL Wise" and "Stacked Bar" counterparts, indicating different aggregation or visualization requirements for the same core data points.
*   **Data Transformation/Normalization:** The `replaceColumnHandler` function is consistently used in `core.export.controller.ts` to standardize 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES' for `pod` and `place_of_delivery`, suggesting a data quality or display requirement.
*   **Query Construction Helpers:** The `bookingQuery` in `export.query.ts` and `bookingQueryBuilder` in `booking.query.ts` demonstrate a modular approach to building complex SQL queries based on report specifics and user selections.
*   **Debugging/Logging:** Frequent `console.log` and `logger.info` statements, particularly in `core.export.controller.ts`, suggest active debugging and monitoring during these changes.
*   **Query Safety:** The update to handle the `WHERE` clause dynamically (`customQuery.toLowerCase().includes("where") ? ... : ...`) in `core.export.controller.ts` at 6:26:45 PM indicates a focus on preventing SQL injection or syntax errors when combining query parts.
*   **Container/MBL Distinctness:** The `DISTINCT ON (m.voyage,m.contno, CASE WHEN m.t49_cont_type IS NOT NULL ... ELSE m.cont_type END )` and `DISTINCT ON (LOWER(m.mblno))` clauses are repeatedly used to ensure unique records for container and MBL related queries.

## 11:49:49 AM
The changes primarily affect two files related to analytics and data export functionalities within a backend application: `booking.query.ts` and `core.export.controller.ts`. The timestamps of these changes span from October 29, 2025, 5:01:49 PM to October 30, 2025, 11:48:05 AM, indicating active development during this period.

**File-specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\booking.query.ts`**
    *   This file, responsible for constructing SQL queries for booking-related analytics, underwent frequent minor modifications.
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes are logged between 10/29/2025, 5:01:49 PM and 10/30/2025, 11:09:18 AM.
    *   **Content:** The code content remained largely identical across all logs for this file, suggesting a series of saves or very minor, unlogged changes (e.g., whitespace, formatting) that are not discernable in the provided diffs. The core logic for `bookingQueryBuilder` and its conditional query generation based on `type` (e.g., `'BookingDatetoActualDeparture'`, `'BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWise'`, `'BookingDatetoActualDepartureStackedBar'`) remained consistent.
    *   **Pattern:** Each entry for this file shows the *exact same code snippet*, implying no functional changes within the provided logs for this specific file. This is highly unusual for a typical development log and might indicate an issue with how the log was generated or filtered, or simply repeated saves without actual code modifications.

2.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\core.export.controller.ts`**
    *   This file handles the export of analytics data, processing incoming requests and building SQL queries using the `bookingQuery` and `nonBookingQuery` functions.
    *   **Timestamp:** Significant changes were recorded between 10/29/2025, 5:59:50 PM and 10/30/2025, 11:48:05 AM.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Initial state (10/29/2025, 5:59:50 PM):** The `getExportData` function constructs `mainQuery` for booking and non-booking reports. For booking reports, it includes `mblWiseQuery`, `COLUMNS`, `customQuery`, and date filters directly concatenated.
        *   **Intermediate change (10/29/2025, 6:05:52 PM):** A comma was added before `customQuery` in the `mainQuery` string for booking reports: `... ${COLUMNS}, ${customQuery} ...`. This was likely a syntax fix.
        *   **Reversion (10/29/2025, 6:08:29 PM):** The comma added in the previous step was removed, reverting to `... ${COLUMNS} ${customQuery} ...`.
        *   **Minor Reversion (10/29/2025, 6:09:55 PM):** The comma was re-added. The code flips back and forth.
        *   **Attempted Fix (10/29/2025, 6:15:39 PM):** A more robust check was added for the `customQuery` to ensure a leading comma if it doesn't already start with one: `... ${customQuery.startsWith(',') ? customQuery : ',' + customQuery} ...`.
        *   **Major Refactoring & Bug Fix (10/29/2025, 6:26:45 PM):**
            *   The `mblWiseQuery` variable's template literal was slightly reformatted (`mblwise === "true" ? ... : ...`) but functionally remained the same.
            *   A significant logic change was introduced to the `mainQuery` construction for booking reports:
                *   A comment `// 🧠 FIXED: close customQuery with parentheses and move your date filter inside a proper WHERE block` was added.
                *   The `mainQuery` now includes a conditional `WHERE` or `AND` clause for date filtering, depending on whether the `customQuery` already contains a `WHERE` clause (`${customQuery.toLowerCase().includes("where") ? ... : ...}`). This aims to prevent SQL syntax errors when combining subqueries.
                *   The outer `ORDER BY departure_date ASC` now explicitly references `data.departure_date`.
        *   **Reversion/Error Introduction (10/29/2025, 6:27:30 PM):** The "major refactoring" of the SQL query string for booking reports was reverted, going back to the less robust concatenation (`${COLUMNS} ${customQuery} AND ${filterBy} ...`). This seems like an accidental rollback or an attempt that was later discarded.
        *   **Later attempt to fix (10/30/2025, 9:33:01 PM):** A special condition was introduced for `reportName === "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)"`. For this specific report, `mainQuery` directly uses the `customQuery` (which is expected to be a full, aggregated `WITH` query), bypassing the standard `SELECT * FROM (...)` wrapper and standard date filtering logic. For other reports, the standard wrapping and date filtering continue. The logging for `filteredData` was updated to `filteredData.length`.
        *   **Reversion (10/30/2025, 9:34:16 PM):** The special handling for "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)" was removed, reverting the booking query construction to its earlier, less robust form.
        *   **Final Major Change (10/30/2025, 11:28:18 AM):** The special handling for queries starting with "WITH" (implying a complex subquery) was re-introduced and refined. If `customQuery` starts with "WITH", it is used directly as `mainQuery`. Otherwise, the standard wrapping (`SELECT * FROM (SELECT ${mblWiseQuery} ${COLUMNS} ${customQuery} AND ${filterBy} ...)`) is applied. This suggests a pattern of iterating on how to handle complex custom queries.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **File `booking.query.ts` consistency:** Despite multiple timestamps, the content of `booking.query.ts` is identical across all provided logs, indicating no effective code changes in this file. This suggests either a logging artifact or repeated, non-functional saves.
*   **File `core.export.controller.ts` iteration on query building:** This file shows a clear pattern of iterative attempts to correctly construct `mainQuery` for different report types, particularly for "booking" reports.
    *   There's a struggle with correctly handling the inclusion of `customQuery` and date filters within the main SQL query, including attempts to add/remove commas and conditional `WHERE`/`AND` clauses.
    *   A major pattern is the evolution of handling *complex, pre-formatted queries* (like those for "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)") that might already include their own `WITH` clauses or aggregation logic. The code moved from simple string concatenation to checking if `customQuery` itself is a complete query (starting with "WITH") and using it directly.
*   **"Booking Date to Actual Departure" variations:** Both files repeatedly reference variations of "Booking Date to Actual Departure" (e.g., standard, MBL-wise, stacked bar) for analytics and export. This indicates these are key report types.
*   **Date filtering logic:** A consistent date filtering pattern is applied: `AND ${filterBy} >= '${fromDate}'::timestamp AND ${filterBy} < '${toDate}'::timestamp + INTERVAL '1 day'`. This logic appears in both files and across various report types.
*   **`replaceColumnHandler` function:** This utility function is consistently present and used in `core.export.controller.ts` to transform `pod` (Port of Discharge) and `place_of_delivery` values from 'LONG BEACH' to 'LOS ANGELES', suggesting a data normalization requirement.
*   **User Object and Permissions:** `getUserObject` and `saveColumns` are consistently used to retrieve user information and save column preferences, highlighting user-specific customization and data persistence.
*   **Error Handling:** Both files include `try-catch` blocks for robust error handling, logging errors, and returning a 500 status on internal server errors.
*   **Logger usage:** `logger.info` is used for debugging and tracking column usage and main query generation.

## 12:53:11 PM
The `ViewContainer.jsx` component, updated at 10/28/2025, 2:02:33 PM and 3:48:07 PM, is responsible for managing custom analytics dashboard views. It handles the creation, editing, and deletion of user-defined dashboards, including the selection of up to 9 metrics using checkboxes. The component integrates with Redux for state management and interacts with an analytics API to save and fetch dashboard configurations. A debugging `console.log` statement was added to inspect `viewOptions`.

The `TreeViewContianer.jsx` component, timestamped 10/28/2025, 2:04:34 PM, 3:46:33 PM, and 3:46:51 PM, displays hierarchical analytics metrics in a tree structure. It received a temporary debugging modification at 3:46:33 PM (adding "kk" to a label) which was promptly reverted at 3:46:51 PM.

The `src\config\analytics.js` file, with multiple timestamps between 10/28/2025, 3:35:37 PM and 10/29/2025, 11:56:24 AM, defines core analytics configurations. This includes default API endpoints, columns for Excel exports, and a comprehensive mapping of report names to their header columns (`ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`). The primary functional change was the completion and addition of entries within `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` related to container metrics. Subsequent identical logs for this file suggest repeated saving without actual code changes.

`PlanboardCardView.jsx`, updated at 10/28/2025, 4:05:26 PM and 4:08:24 PM, renders planboard data in customizable card views. It fetches data and applies filters based on user selection. A `console.log` was added at 4:08:24 PM for debugging the fetched `planboardData`.

The `MetricFooter.jsx` component, updated at 10/29/2025, 9:56:31 AM and 9:57:53 AM, provides export functionalities (Excel and PDF) and a full-screen option for analytics charts. It introduced a `ColumnsSelector` for customized Excel exports. Debugging `console.log` statements were added to inspect `item` data.

`MetricToolbar.jsx`, modified frequently between 10/29/2025, 10:54:57 AM and 5:27:47 PM, is responsible for the filter and view controls of individual metrics. This file experienced numerous temporary changes, including toggling the visibility of period, view-by, and date range filters, as well as transient HTML insertions, indicating active UI development and debugging. A `console.log` statement was added to monitor the `toolState`.

`MetricsBox.jsx`, updated between 10/29/2025, 11:02:52 AM and 12:11:06 PM, acts as a container for displaying various analytics charts. It dynamically renders chart types and includes functionality for enlarging charts. Similar to `MetricToolbar`, it saw temporary commenting/uncommenting of the `MetricToolbar` component, suggesting UI integration testing. Multiple `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes.

The `methods.js` utility file, with significant changes at 10/29/2025, 11:18:07 AM and 11:25:01 AM, provides helper functions for analytics data processing and report generation. Key updates included refining the `metricsPackageHandler` for chart type detection (removing a specific report name check for `StackedBar`), and enhancing the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function to handle `selectedColumns` for Excel export.

The `StackedBarChart.jsx` component was extensively modified between 10/29/2025, 11:45:45 AM and 5:20:39 PM. It showed an iterative development process to correctly handle data for stacked bar charts, particularly concerning quarter-over-quarter comparisons and different time period filters (month, week, quarter). The logic for generating chart categories and series was frequently refined, with changes being introduced and sometimes reverted to explore different data structuring approaches. This component also featured numerous `console.log` statements for debugging.

Finally, `AnalyticsContainer.jsx`, updated at 10/29/2025, 4:53:53 PM, is the main component orchestrating analytics metrics. It supports drag-and-drop reordering and resizing of metrics using `DndProvider`. It integrates Redux state and interacts with APIs to fetch reports and persist metric sequence and size changes, using helper functions from `methods.js` to process data.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging:** The logs show a strong pattern of developers adding and removing `console.log` statements across almost all files, indicating active and iterative debugging.
*   **UI Iteration:** Frequent commenting out and uncommenting of UI components (e.g., in `MetricToolbar.jsx` and `MetricsBox.jsx`) suggests active experimentation and refinement of user interface elements.
*   **Analytics Feature Development:** There's a clear focus on enhancing analytics features, including custom view management, flexible report generation, and robust chart rendering, especially for stacked bar charts.
*   **State Management and API Integration:** Redux is consistently used for managing application state, and interactions with backend APIs are central to data fetching, saving, and updating configurations.
*   **Configuration Refinement:** The `analytics.js` configuration file is evolving to support more detailed report headers and export options.

## 1:52:51 PM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on the frontend of an analytics dashboard, encompassing custom view management, metric display, filtering, and export capabilities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`ViewContainer.jsx` (10/28/2025):** This component, responsible for managing custom analytic views, underwent minor debugging additions. `console.log` statements were added to inspect `viewOptions` and `viewName`. Functionally, it allows users to create, edit, save, and delete dashboards, select up to 9 metrics from "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" categories, and view audit logs. It interacts with Redux for state management and an API for dashboard operations.

*   **`TreeViewContianer.jsx` (10/28/2025):** This component displays a hierarchical list of metrics for selection. A temporary string "kk" was briefly added and then removed from a metric label, indicating a quick UI test or debugging during development.

*   **`analytics.js` (Multiple timestamps 10/28/2025 - 10/30/2025):** This configuration file defines various analytics constants, including default API endpoints, columns for Excel exports, and comprehensive report headers (`ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`) categorized by CBM, TEU, KGS, and Transit metrics. While many entries show identical content across timestamps, the initial entries corrected or expanded the `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` definition for container-related metrics. The numerous identical entries suggest frequent saves or minor, unrecorded changes being reverted.

*   **`PlanboardCardView.jsx` (10/28/2025):** This component, which renders planboard data in different views (yearly/monthly), had a `console.log` added to debug `planboardData`. It includes a `NoDataAvailable` component displaying a specific string "No Data Available123".

*   **`MetricFooter.jsx` (10/29/2025):** This component provides export functionality for analytics metrics. It added a `console.log` for debugging the `item` prop. Functionally, it supports displaying calculation chips, formula tooltips, and exporting data to Excel (with column selection) and PDF. A temporary "Excel1" label was present on the Excel export button.

*   **`MetricToolbar.jsx` (Multiple timestamps 10/29/2025):** This component handles filtering for metrics. It saw several rapid changes, including:
    *   Correction of a "Period1" label to "Period".
    *   Frequent commenting and uncommenting of the "Custom Date Range" popover panel.
    *   Brief addition and removal of debug HTML (`<h1>hhhhh</h1>`).
    *   Repeated commenting and uncommenting of the "Period", "View By", and "Filter" (date range) `SelectBoxLight` components.
    These changes indicate a dynamic and iterative development process for filter controls, possibly testing different UI configurations or debugging filter application. A `console.log` for `toolState` was also added.

*   **`MetricsBox.jsx` (Multiple timestamps 10/29/2025):** This component renders individual chart types and their associated toolbars/footers.
    *   It saw commenting and uncommenting of the `MetricToolbar` component, similar to `MetricToolbar.jsx`.
    *   Debugging `console.log` statements were added for `item` and `data`.
    *   The chart rendering logic for the non-enlarged view was updated to display only the first 9 data points (`item.data.slice(0, 9)`), implying a performance or layout optimization for the default view.

*   **`methods.js` (Multiple timestamps 10/29/2025):** This utility file for analytics was primarily subject to repetitive saves with identical content. One functional change involved simplifying the `findChartType` default logic in `metricsPackageHandler` to always return `AnalyticsChartType.General` rather than conditionally `AnalyticsChartType.Stackbar`.

*   **`StackedBarChart.jsx` (Multiple timestamps 10/29/2025):** This component, dedicated to stacked bar chart rendering, shows the most volatile change history:
    *   Initial setup included dynamic category generation and tooltip formatting.
    *   Early changes adjusted `plotOptions`, `dataLabels`, and `tooltip` styles.
    *   It underwent significant refactoring multiple times in `useEffect` and data preparation logic, particularly around handling "This Quarter" vs "Last Quarter" data and distinguishing it from general stacked metrics. This involved introducing `isQuarterData` flags and conditional data processing.
    *   There were several instances of implementing complex data aggregation and category generation based on period filters (`month`, `week`, `quarter`), followed by reverts to simpler or earlier implementations, and then re-implementing a more robust combined logic.
    *   Debugging `console.log` statements (`===hgdatta====`) were frequently added and removed. These repeated changes, including numerous reverts, suggest a challenging and iterative process to correctly process and visualize different data structures for stacked bar charts, especially quarter-over-quarter comparisons and period-based aggregations.

*   **`AnalyticsContainer.jsx` (10/29/2025):** This top-level analytics component was introduced, establishing a resizable grid layout for metrics using `react-dnd`. It implements functionalities for reordering metrics (`moveItem`), saving their sizes (`saveSize`), and updating their view types (`saveView`). It orchestrates fetching individual reports and updating the Redux state with processed data using `metricsPackageHandler`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **October 28, 2025, 2:02:33 PM:** Initial implementation of `ViewContainer.jsx`, outlining core custom dashboard management.
*   **October 28, 2025, 3:37:47 PM:** Expansion/correction of `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` in `analytics.js`.
*   **October 29, 2025, 9:56:31 AM:** Initial detailed implementation of `MetricFooter.jsx` with export functionalities.
*   **October 29, 2025, 10:54:57 AM:** Initial detailed implementation of `MetricToolbar.jsx` with filtering options.
*   **October 29, 2025, 11:02:52 AM:** Initial detailed implementation of `MetricsBox.jsx` for dynamic chart rendering.
*   **October 29, 2025, 11:18:07 AM:** Initial detailed implementation of `methods.js` with various analytics utility functions.
*   **October 29, 2025, 11:20:37 AM:** Optimization in `MetricsBox.jsx` to limit initial data displayed in charts.
*   **October 29, 2025, 11:45:45 AM:** Initial implementation of `StackedBarChart.jsx`.
*   **October 29, 2025, 12:16:08 PM:** Introduction of smart detection for quarter-based data in `StackedBarChart.jsx`.
*   **October 29, 2025, 2:54:27 PM:** Major refinement to `StackedBarChart.jsx` data processing for robustness and error prevention. (Although later reverted and re-applied)
*   **October 29, 2025, 2:58:21 PM / 3:01:18 PM:** Refactoring in `StackedBarChart.jsx` to handle different period filters more explicitly.
*   **October 29, 2025, 3:36:07 PM / 3:37:11 PM:** Further attempts to solidify the `StackedBarChart.jsx` logic for quarter comparison and general stacked data.
*   **October 29, 2025, 4:53:53 PM:** Introduction of `AnalyticsContainer.jsx` integrating grid layout, drag-and-drop, and metric management.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frontend Analytics Focus:** The changes collectively show a strong focus on building a dynamic and interactive analytics dashboard, including custom views, data visualization (various chart types, especially stacked bars), and user interaction features like filtering, reordering, and data export.
*   **Redux for State Management:** Consistent use of Redux (via `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`) across multiple components to manage application state, particularly for analytics data, filters, and user information.
*   **RTK Query for API Interaction:** Reliance on RTK Query (`@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`) for fetching and mutating data, centralizing API interactions.
*   **MUI for UI Components:** Extensive use of Material-UI (MUI) components, indicating a standardized design system and component library.
*   **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** Frequent `console.log` statements and repeated patterns of code changes (especially in `MetricToolbar.jsx` and `StackedBarChart.jsx`, where changes are made, reverted, and re-applied) suggest an active and often trial-and-error development process, particularly for complex data handling and UI logic.
*   **Date and Time Manipulation:** `moment.js` is used for date formatting, especially for filtering and displaying report periods.
*   **Export Functionality:** Consistent implementation of Excel (using `ExcelJS`) and PDF (using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`) export features for analytics reports.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Logic is well-separated into components (`ViewContainer`, `MetricToolbar`, `MetricFooter`, `MetricsBox`), chart-specific components (`StackedBarChart`), and utility files (`methods.js`, `analytics.js`).
