# Activity Summary for 10/11/2025

## 10:27:32 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`. The updates primarily revolve around the `saveCustomerDetails` function, with other functions (`getAll`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, `CreateCustomer`) remaining consistently unchanged across all entries.

**File-Specific Updates for `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`**:

*   **Timestamp: 10/10/2025, 5:28:52 PM (Initial State)**
    *   The `saveCustomerDetails` function initiates a database transaction (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).
    *   It constructs a `customerDetailsPayload` using `reqBody.name`, `reqBody.pan_no`, and sets `created_at` from `reqBody.created_at` or a new date.
    *   It inserts this payload into the `customer` table.
    *   On success, it responds with `HttpStatusCodes.OK` (200) and the inserted customer data.
    *   The `CreateCustomer` function processes multiple related entities like GST locations, key personal details, alerts, and credit control, inserting them into their respective tables within a transaction.

*   **Timestamp: 10/10/2025, 5:50:26 PM**
    *   **`saveCustomerDetails` function:**
        *   The type definition for `reqBody` was narrowed to explicitly `{ name: string; pan_no: string; status?: string; }`.
        *   New validation was added to check for the presence of `reqBody.name` and `reqBody.pan_no`, returning a 400 Bad Request error if missing.
        *   The `customerPayload` construction was updated to explicitly set `status: reqBody.status || "ACTIVE"` and `created_at: new Date()`. The commented-out `group` field was removed.
        *   The success response status code changed from `HttpStatusCodes.OK` (200) to `201 Created`.
        *   The error response status code changed from `HttpStatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` to a literal `500`.

*   **Timestamp: 10/10/2025, 5:52:22 PM**
    *   **`saveCustomerDetails` function:**
        *   The database transaction commands (`await query("BEGIN");`, `await query("COMMIT");`, `await query("ROLLBACK");`) were commented out, effectively disabling explicit transaction management for this function.
        *   The `data` field in the successful JSON response (`data: insertedCustomer[0]`) was commented out.

*   **Timestamp: 10/10/2025, 5:54:18 PM**
    *   **`saveCustomerDetails` function:**
        *   The result variable from `insertQuery` was renamed from `insertedCustomer` to `gstData`, and its type annotation was adjusted accordingly, even though it was still inserting into the `customer` table.
        *   The `data` field in the successful JSON response was re-enabled, referencing `gstData.rows[0]`.
        *   Transaction commands remained commented out.

*   **Timestamp: 10/10/2025, 6:09:58 PM (Final State)**
    *   **`saveCustomerDetails` function:**
        *   All changes made to `saveCustomerDetails` since 5:28:52 PM were reverted.
        *   The `reqBody` type reverted to `CustomerRequestBodyType`.
        *   The input validation for `name` and `pan_no` was removed.
        *   Database transaction commands (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) were uncommented and reactivated.
        *   The success response status code reverted to `HttpStatusCodes.OK` (200).
        *   The `customerDetailsPayload` structure reverted, including the commented-out `group` field and allowing `reqBody.created_at`.
        *   The response `data: insertedCustomer[0]` was restored with the original variable name.
        *   The error response status code reverted to `HttpStatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Iteration and Reversion:** The log clearly shows a pattern of rapid iteration and experimentation within the `saveCustomerDetails` function, followed by a complete reversion to an earlier state. This suggests either the changes introduced issues, or the original design was ultimately preferred.
*   **Transaction Management:** There was a brief period where explicit transaction calls (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) were commented out, only to be re-enabled. This highlights the importance of transaction integrity in the final accepted code.
*   **Consistency in Other Functions:** The `getAll`, `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`, and `CreateCustomer` functions remained untouched throughout these changes, indicating that the development focus during this period was solely on the `saveCustomerDetails` logic.
