# Activity Summary for 10/29/2025

## 10:25:04 AM
The core of these changes centers on enhancing the analytics and planboard features of a frontend application, specifically concerning custom view management, data display, and export functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.jsx`**
    *   **(10/28/2025, 2:02:33 PM):** This file introduces a robust component for creating, editing, and deleting custom analytics dashboards. It includes state management for selected metrics (`checkBoxManager`, `numChecked`), a view name, and alert configurations. It integrates with Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for global state management and interacts with an `analyticsApi` for fetching dashboard options and saving/deleting views. The component supports "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" metric selection via tabs and a `TreeViewContianer`. Key actions like saving (POST/PUT based on `action`) and deleting views are implemented with toast notifications and Redux dispatches to update the UI. An `AuditViewDrawer` is also integrated for audit functionality.
    *   **(10/28/2025, 3:48:07 PM & 10/28/2025, 5:53:50 PM):** Minor debugging statements (`console.log`) were added to inspect `viewOptions` and `viewName`.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.jsx`**
    *   **(10/28/2025, 2:04:34 PM):** This component is responsible for rendering a hierarchical tree view of analytics metrics, grouped by category. It uses `@mui/x-tree-view` components. Checkboxes are integrated into each metric item, and their checked state is controlled by the `checkBoxManager` prop, with `handleCheckBoxClicked` managing selection logic.
    *   **(10/28/2025, 3:46:33 PM & 10/28/2025, 3:46:51 PM):** A temporary "kk" string was added and subsequently removed from the metric label, indicating a brief debugging or testing phase for the display of metric names.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\config\analytics.js`**
    *   **(10/28/2025, 3:35:37 PM):** This file defines extensive configuration constants for analytics, including:
        *   `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`: A list of default report names and their corresponding API URLs, categorized by grouping columns (e.g., `scac_code`, `pol`, `pod`, `shipper`) and metrics (CBM, TEU).
        *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A comprehensive list of column definitions (key and display name) for Excel exports, covering various shipping and tracking details.
        *   `CargoReadyToETD10Days`: A specific subset of columns.
        *   `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`: A large object mapping report names to arrays of strings representing their expected table headers, covering CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit Time, and Chassis-related metrics, both "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise."
    *   **(10/28/2025, 3:37:47 PM):** A previous incomplete header entry for "Containers Shipped" was removed, and an incomplete "Container by Ocean Freight Carrier (SCAC)" entry was completed, along with adding "Container by Port of Loading". This indicates a refinement and completion of the report header configurations.
    *   **(10/28/2025, 3:38:11 PM & 10/28/2025, 5:49:01 PM):** These timestamps show no discernible content changes, suggesting potential save operations or automated formatting updates without functional modifications.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\planboard\PlanboardCardView.jsx`**
    *   **(10/28/2025, 4:05:26 PM):** This component manages the display of planboard data, supporting both "year" and "month" views. It fetches data using `useFetchPlanboardQuery` and processes it with `filterHandler` and `prepare...FilterObject` utility functions. It conditionally renders `YearViewItem` (grid layout) or `MonthViewItem` (horizontal stack of scrollable monthly cards) and includes a `NoDataAvailable` component. The `NoDataAvailable` text was temporarily `No Data Available123`.
    *   **(10/28/2025, 4:08:24 PM):** A debugging `console.log` statement was added to display `planboardData`.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.jsx`**
    *   **(10/29/2025, 9:56:31 AM):** This component provides interactive footer elements for analytics metrics, enabling data export and view enlargement. It offers Excel export with a `ColumnsSelector` for user-defined columns, and PDF export using `jspdf` and `html2canvas` to render the chart component into a PDF. Loading states are managed for both export types. It also displays calculated metric values (`calShow`, `calType`, `calValue`) and tooltips for report formulas.
    *   **(10/29/2025, 9:57:53 AM):** A debugging `console.log` statement was added to inspect the `item` prop.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/28/2025, 2:02:33 PM:** Introduction of the comprehensive `ViewContainer.jsx` for analytics custom view management.
*   **10/28/2025, 2:04:34 PM:** Initial implementation of `TreeViewContianer.jsx` for displaying metrics.
*   **10/28/2025, 3:35:37 PM:** Detailed configuration of analytics reports and export columns in `analytics.js`.
*   **10/28/2025, 3:37:47 PM:** Refinement of analytics report headers in `analytics.js`, including completion of previously truncated entries.
*   **10/28/2025, 4:05:26 PM:** Implementation of `PlanboardCardView.jsx` for displaying planboard data in different views.
*   **10/29/2025, 9:56:31 AM:** Integration of advanced export functionalities (Excel with column selection, PDF generation) into `MetricFooter.jsx`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Statements:** There's a recurring pattern of adding `console.log` statements in various components (`ViewContainer`, `TreeViewContianer`, `PlanboardCardView`, `MetricFooter`) at different timestamps. This indicates active development, testing, and troubleshooting across these UI features.
*   **Redux/RTK Query Integration:** The application consistently uses Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and RTK Query (`useFetch...Query`, `useSave...Mutation`) for state management and API interactions across multiple components (`ViewContainer`, `PlanboardCardView`, `MetricFooter`), highlighting a centralized data flow architecture.
*   **Material-UI (MUI) & Custom Components:** The changes extensively utilize Material-UI components (e.g., `Box`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `CircularProgress`, `Tooltip`, `Chip`, `TreeItem`, `SimpleTreeView`) along with custom common components (`InputBox`, `ThemeButton`, `OutlinedButton`, `ThemeTabs`, `Loader`, `PopupAlert`, `AuditViewDrawer`, `TMenu`, `ThemedModal`, `ColumnsSelector`). This indicates a consistent design system and component-based development approach.
*   **Analytics Feature Development:** A strong focus is observed on the analytics section, encompassing custom dashboard creation, metric selection, configuration of various reports (CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit, Chassis), and comprehensive data export options.
*   **Rapid Iteration/Commits:** The timestamps for `analytics.js` show very close successive entries (3:35:37 PM, 3:37:47 PM, 3:38:11 PM, 5:49:01 PM), with some content appearing identical between logs. This could imply frequent saves, automated formatting, or quick, iterative adjustments.
