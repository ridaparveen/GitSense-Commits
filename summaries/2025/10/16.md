# Activity Summary for 10/16/2025

## 10:43:12 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\globalUpload.ts` was updated twice in rapid succession, on `10/15/2025, 6:37:28 PM` and `10/15/2025, 6:37:34 PM`.

This file defines a core utility function, `saveDoc`, designed to handle the saving of multiple uploaded documents. Key functionalities include:
*   **Interface Definition:** An `interface SaveDocParams` specifies the required parameters for `saveDoc`, including `ref_type`, `ref_id`, `remark` (optional), `uploaded_by`, `document_type`, and an array of `Express.Multer.File` objects.
*   **File Processing:** The `saveDoc` function iterates through an array of uploaded files, extracting `originalname`, `path`, and deriving `document_type` from the file's extension.
*   **Database Interaction:** It interacts with a database via a `query` function (imported from `./database`) to insert document metadata into a `document_upload` table. The `INSERT` statement captures `ref_type`, `ref_id`, `document_name`, `document_path`, `document_type`, `remark`, `uploaded_by`, and sets `uploaded_at` and `updated_at` to the current timestamp (`NOW()`).
*   **Error Handling:** A `try...catch` block is used to catch potential errors during the database operation, re-throwing the error message.
*   **Debugging/Logging:** A `console.log("===files123", files);` statement is present within the file iteration loop, likely for debugging purposes.

The content of the file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating that no functional code changes were introduced between the 6-second interval, suggesting either an immediate re-save or no substantive modification at that point. This module appears to be a central component for managing document uploads and their corresponding database records within the `envosys-backend` project.

## 10:43:41 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around customer details management and document uploading functionalities within a frontend application. The updates occurred between October 15th and 16th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\UploadFiles.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State & `ref_type` (10/15, 5:44 PM - 6:13 PM; 10/16, 10:41 AM - 10:42 AM)**: The component, `customerDocuments` (later `CustomerDocuments`, then reverted), manages document uploads for a customer. Initially, the `ref_type` for documents was consistently set to `"vendor_doc"`. There were several iterative changes to align this, first changing the initial state's `ref_type` to `"customer_doc"` (10/15, 5:50 PM), then fixing `handleFileChange` to also use `"customer_doc"` (10/15, 6:13 PM). However, a later commit (10/16, 10:41 AM) reverted all `ref_type` settings back to `"vendor_doc"`, only to be immediately corrected again to `"customer_doc"` (10/16, 10:42 AM), indicating a back-and-forth in establishing the correct document reference type.
    *   **Refactoring & Type Improvements (10/16, 10:30 AM)**: A significant change introduced type annotations for `fileInputRefs` and function parameters, renamed the component to `CustomerDocuments` (PascalCase), and extracted the `formik.setFieldValue` logic into a helper function `updateFormikDocuments`. This aimed to improve code readability, maintainability, and type safety.
    *   **Revert of Refactoring (10/16, 10:40 AM)**: Most of the refactoring and type improvements from the previous commit were reverted, returning the component name to `customerDocuments` (camelCase), removing explicit typings, and re-inlining the `formik.setFieldValue` calls. This suggests a decision to postpone or rethink the refactoring at that moment.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\CustomerNavTab.tsx`**
    *   **Integration (10/15, 5:45 PM)**: This component was updated to include the `CustomerDocument` (likely referring to `UploadFiles.tsx`) within its tab structure, passing the `formik` prop. It also features a commented-out `GstRejistrtaionDetails` component.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\customer\CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Form Values (10/15, 5:49 PM - 6:36 PM)**: The `formValues` state, which defines the initial structure for customer data, saw several adjustments. The `uploadDocuments` array's initial object had its `serial_id` changed from a dynamic `Date.now().toString()` to an empty string (10/15, 6:14 PM), and later, the entire `uploadDocuments` array was initialized as empty `[]` (10/15, 6:36 PM), suggesting a shift to dynamically adding documents instead of pre-filling an empty slot.
    *   **`FormData` Handling for Document Uploads (10/15, 6:26 PM - 10/16, 10:38 AM)**: This component contains the `handleSubmit` logic for creating/updating customer details, including file uploads.
        *   Initially, files were appended with the key `"vendor_doc"` (10/15, 5:49 PM). This was updated to `"customer_doc"` (10/15, 6:26 PM) to match the customer context.
        *   The way `document_name` was extracted and prioritized from `doc.document_name` or `doc.file?.name` was refined (10/15, 6:31 PM).
        *   There was a brief, potentially erroneous, change to send `doc.file.name` instead of the `doc.file` object itself when appending to `formData` with the `"customer_doc"` key (10/15, 6:35 PM).
        *   A significant improvement in `FormData` handling for `uploadDocuments` was introduced (10/16, 10:19 AM). Instead of stringifying the entire array and sending files separately, each document's properties (like `ref_type`, `document_type`, `document_name`, and the actual `file` object) are now appended individually using an array-like indexing scheme (`uploadDocuments[${index}][property]`). This allows for proper multipart form data submission for multiple files with their associated metadata.
        *   The problematic `formData.append("customer_doc", doc.file?.name)` was removed, relying entirely on the indexed `uploadDocuments` structure for file submission (10/16, 10:38 AM).
    *   **Debugging (`console.log`) (10/16, 10:34 AM - 10:35 AM)**: Several `console.log` statements were added to inspect responses from API calls (`createResponse`, `updateResponse`), indicating active debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\customer.types.ts`**
    *   **Interface Definitions (10/15, 5:49 PM)**: This file defines the data structures (`interfaces`) used across the customer-related components, including a detailed `UploadDocument` interface which supports `file` objects and `document_name`. No direct changes were logged for this file during the observed period, indicating its stability as a contract for data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Document Type Consistency**: A recurring effort to ensure the `ref_type` for uploaded documents is consistently set to `"customer_doc"` rather than `"vendor_doc"` across the `UploadFiles.tsx` component and the `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`'s `handleSubmit` function.
*   **Formik Integration**: Both `UploadFiles.tsx` and `CustomerNavTab.tsx` heavily rely on the `formik` prop for managing form state and values, demonstrating a consistent form management strategy.
*   **File Upload Complexity**: The changes in `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` regarding `FormData` illustrate the complexity of handling multiple file uploads along with their associated metadata, leading to a more structured and robust approach over several iterations.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The frequent addition of `console.log` statements throughout `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` indicates an active development and debugging process to understand data flows and API responses.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The log shows an iterative development process, with changes, reverts, and further refinements occurring in quick succession, particularly in `UploadFiles.tsx` for type safety and `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` for `FormData` handling.

## 11:43:21 AM
The primary file updated in the provided log is `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`. This file handles various customer-related services, including retrieval, dashboard information, and creation/saving of customer details.

**Key updates for `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`:**

*   **Initial State (10/16/2025, 10:56:49 AM):** The file defined several core functionalities:
    *   `getAll`: A comprehensive function for fetching customer data with advanced filtering (status, date range, customer ID, type, location, name), pagination, and sorting. It also generates distinct options for status, location, and customer type for UI dropdowns.
    *   `getCustomerDashboardCardInfo`: This function retrieves aggregated counts of active, inactive, and total customers, supporting filtering by date range (weekly, monthly, or custom periods).
    *   `saveCustomerDetails`: Responsible for creating a new primary customer entry with a unique `customer_id`, using a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
    *   `CreateCustomer`: A more elaborate customer creation endpoint designed to handle multiple related data points. It processes GST locations, key personal details, and potentially other details (alert mappings, credit control, FAC, uploaded documents). It includes logic to update a customer's status if provided and performs insertions into `customer_gst_location` and `customer_key_personal` tables, along with auditing each GST location creation.

*   **Significant Change (10/16/2025, 11:18:07 AM):** A defensive programming improvement was made within the `CreateCustomer` function. An `if(gstLocationsRaw?.length)` condition was added around the loop that iterates through `gstLocationsRaw`. This ensures that the code attempts to process GST locations only when the `gstLocationsRaw` array exists and contains elements, preventing potential errors if it's null or empty.

*   **Subsequent Timestamps (10/16/2025, 11:26:54 AM, 11:29:10 AM, 11:32:24 AM):** The code content for these timestamps remains identical to the 11:18:07 AM version, indicating no further functional changes were committed in these specific log entries. These might represent saves without modifications or routine system logging.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database Interactions:** The service heavily relies on database operations (`insertMany`, `insertQuery`, `query`, `updateQuery`) managed through utility functions. Database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) are consistently used in `saveCustomerDetails` and `CreateCustomer` to maintain data integrity.
*   **Query Building:** The `QueryBuilder` utility is utilized in `getAll` to construct dynamic and complex SQL queries, enhancing reusability and maintainability.
*   **Error Handling:** All `async` functions include `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors, returning appropriate `HttpStatusCodes` and logging errors using a `logger` and `console.log`.
*   **Audit Logging:** The `simpleAudit` module is integrated into the `CreateCustomer` function to track significant changes, specifically the creation of GST locations, providing a clear audit trail.
*   **Data Validation and Defaults:** Payloads often include nullish coalescing operators (`??`) or logical OR (`||`) to provide default values for properties if they are missing or undefined.
*   **Timestamp Management:** `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are consistently managed, with `new Date()` being used for new records and `NOW()` for updates in SQL queries.
*   **Debugging:** Frequent `console.log` statements are present throughout the functions, likely for debugging during development.

## 11:43:28 AM
The code changes primarily affect two files: `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` and `customerDataApi.ts`, both within the `envosys-frontend` project. The changes span a period from 10:44 AM to 11:33 AM on October 16, 2025, highlighting active development and debugging, particularly around form submission and file uploads.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\customer\CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`**

*   **10/16/2025, 10:44:44 AM:** An initial attempt to append a file to `FormData` within the `handleSubmit` function contained a syntax error (`doc.file?.`).
*   **10/16/2025, 10:44:56 AM:** The syntax error for appending `doc.file` to `formData.append("customer_doc", doc.file)` was corrected.
*   **10/16/2025, 10:45:07 AM:** The file appending key in `handleSubmit` was temporarily changed from `"customer_doc"` to `"uploadDocuments"`, potentially overwriting the JSON metadata for the document.
*   **10/16/2025, 10:52:20 AM:** The file appending key was reverted back to `"customer_doc"`, indicating the previous change was likely an unintended side effect or experiment.
*   **10/16/2025, 10:55:48 AM:** The file appending logic was updated to use indexed keys (`files[${index}]`) for multiple file uploads, suggesting a new strategy for handling file arrays on the backend.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:01:46 AM:** Significant refactoring in `handleSubmit`:
    *   The order of `formData.append` calls for file and JSON metadata was reversed, with files now being appended first.
    *   The file appending key was reverted again to `"customer_doc"` from the indexed `files[${index}]`.
    *   A `customer_id` field was added to the `FormData`.
    *   Crucially, the `createCustomereDetails` and `updateCustomerDetails` mutations were still being called with the raw `values` object instead of the constructed `formData`.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:03:43 AM:** A comment was added in `handleSubmit` emphasizing that files should be appended to `FormData` before sending.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:14:55 AM:** Minor refactoring of `handleSubmit` to store mutation responses in a temporary variable before conditional logic, without changing the core functionality of passing `values`.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:15:34 AM:** **Critical fix**: The `createCustomereDetails` and `updateCustomerDetails` mutations were finally updated to correctly pass the `formData` object instead of `values`, enabling actual file upload functionality.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:19:04 AM:** A commented-out `useEffect` block, which would reset the form on non-edit actions, was removed.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:33:28 AM:** The previously removed `useEffect` block for form resetting was reinstated, although it remains commented out. This indicates ongoing consideration of form reset logic.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\customerDataApi.ts`**

*   **10/16/2025, 11:08:25 AM:** The initial state of this API endpoint definition shows `createCustomer` correctly configured for `FormData` (no explicit headers, `body: formData`), but `updateCustomer` was incorrectly setting `body: params` and explicitly including `headers: getAppHeaders()`, which is incompatible with `FormData` uploads.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:12:05 AM:** Debugging code (a `for...of` loop to `console.log` FormData entries) was uncommented within the `createCustomer` mutation.
*   **10/16/2025, 11:21:14 AM:** **Critical fix**: The `updateCustomer` mutation was updated to correctly handle `FormData` by changing its type signature to `builder.mutation<any, FormData>` and setting `body: formData`. The explicit `headers` line was also removed to allow `fetchBaseQuery` to automatically set `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.
    *   `invalidatesTags` were also adjusted for `saveCustomerDetails` and `createCustomer`, indicating refined cache invalidation strategies.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   A strong recurring theme is the process of correctly implementing and debugging file uploads using `FormData` with RTK Query, involving multiple iterations of how files and metadata are appended and how the `FormData` object is passed to the API mutations.
*   The use of `console.log` statements across different timestamps suggests a methodical, iterative debugging approach.
*   There is some indecision or ongoing discussion regarding the `resetForm()` dispatch, indicated by its repeated removal and reinstatement (though commented out).

## 12:43:20 PM
The `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts` file underwent several iterations of changes within a short period on October 16, 2025.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **10/16/2025, 11:46:09 AM:** The `getAll` function initially contained a `LEFT JOIN` between `customer` (aliased as `cs`) and `customer_gst_location` (aliased as `gs`) using the condition `gs.serial_id = cs.serial_id`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:16:10 PM:** The join condition in the `getAll` function was modified, changing from `gs.serial_id = cs.serial_id` to `gs.customer_id = cs.serial_id`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:17:11 PM:** A `console.log("===rows", rows);` statement was uncommented within the `getAll` function, likely for debugging purposes.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:20:11 PM:** A new `console.log("===gstlocation",gstLocations);` statement was introduced in the `CreateCustomer` function.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:23:35 PM:** The join condition in the `getAll` function was reverted to its earlier state: `gs.serial_id = cs.serial_id`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:25:19 PM:** The join condition in the `getAll` function was changed back again to `gs.customer_id = cs.serial_id`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:30:02 PM:** The `setColumns` method within the `getAll` function was updated to include `"gst.country"`. This appears to be a minor typo as `gst` is not the alias used for `customer_gst_location`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:31:21 PM:** The typo in the `setColumns` array was corrected, changing `"gst.country"` to `"gs.country"`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The timestamps show a rapid succession of changes, indicating active development and debugging:

*   **10/16/2025, 12:16:10 PM:** Initial modification of the critical join condition in `getAll`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:23:35 PM:** Reversion of the join condition, suggesting a re-evaluation or testing.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:25:19 PM:** Another change to the join condition, settling on `gs.customer_id = cs.serial_id`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:30:02 PM** and **12:31:21 PM:** Introduction and immediate correction of a column name/alias in the select statement.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Join Condition Adjustments:** There's a noticeable pattern of modifying and re-modifying the `LEFT JOIN` condition in the `getAll` function, specifically toggling between `gs.serial_id = cs.serial_id` and `gs.customer_id = cs.serial_id`. This suggests ongoing refinement or debugging related to correctly linking `customer` and `customer_gst_location` tables.
*   **Debugging Statements:** The addition of `console.log` statements in both `getAll` and `CreateCustomer` functions indicates active testing and debugging efforts by the developer.
*   **Minor Syntax Refinements:** The correction of the column alias from `"gst.country"` to `"gs.country"` shows attention to detail in the final stages or during code review.

## 12:43:43 PM
The code changes detail significant updates across customer management features within the `envosys-frontend` application, primarily focusing on customer details, dashboard functionalities, GST location management, and file uploads.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\customer\CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/16/2025, 12:22:07 PM)**
    *   This file, a core page for customer details, received a major overhaul. It now imports various utilities for state management (`useEffect`, `useState`, Redux `useDispatch`, `useSelector`), navigation (`useLocation`, `useNavigate`), and API interaction (`useCreateCustomerMutation`, `useUpdateCustomerMutation`, `useGetCustomerDetailsQuery`).
    *   Initial form values (`formValues`) are extensively defined to include customer ID, multiple GST locations, key personal details, alert mappings, credit control details, FAC details, and upload documents, often initialized from `location.state` or default structures.
    *   It integrates with Redux slices to manage `gstLocation` data (`resetForm`, `setGSTData`).
    *   A `useEffect` hook now updates the customer status dropdown (`statusValue`) based on fetched customer data. Another `useEffect` populates `formValues` for "edit" actions using data from `useFetchCustomerDetailsQuery`, specifically handling updates to `gstLocations` from `location.state`.
    *   The `handleSubmit` function is robust, handling both "add" and "edit" modes. It constructs `FormData` to send stringified JSON for various detail sections and actual `File` objects for `uploadDocuments`. It uses `toast` for user feedback and navigates upon success or failure.
    *   The UI includes a `PageWrapper`, navigation arrow, a title that changes based on `formAction`, and a `SelectBox` for customer status. The `CustomerGSTForm` component is rendered for the main content.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` (Timestamps: 10/16/2025, 12:30:12 PM and 10/16/2025, 12:32:00 PM)**
    *   This file defines column configurations for several data grids:
        *   `CUSTOMER_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`: Displays general customer information like status, ID, name, PAN, address, type, and email. The "Status" column uses a `Badge` component for visual indication, and an "Action" column provides a `TMenu` for customer-specific actions (edit, delete, etc.).
        *   `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`: Focuses on customer booking details, including booking numbers, vessel/voyage, POL/POD, line name, DO number, commodity, other services (with icons for transportation and customs clearance), and equipment. An "Action" column is provided, with its button disabled if the booking status is "CONFIRMED".
        *   `CUSTOMER_NEW_BOOKING_COLUMNS`: Similar to booking dashboard columns, but includes a `RadioGroup` for selecting a row, likely for creating new bookings.
        *   `CUSTOMER_BOOKING_INVENTORY_COLUMNS`: Defines editable columns for inventory details such as container number, vehicle number, size, type, and various gate-in/pickup timestamps.
    *   A minor but significant change occurred at 12:32:00 PM: the "Location" column in `CUSTOMER_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` was updated to display "City" instead of "Country" by changing the `field` from `"country"` to `"city"` and `headerName` from `"Location"` to `"City"`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\UploadFiles.tsx` (Timestamps: 10/16/2025, 12:33:32 PM, 12:35:02 PM, 12:36:07 PM, 12:38:09 PM, 12:39:06 PM)**
    *   This component manages the upload of customer-related documents in a dynamic table.
    *   It uses `useState` to manage an array of `rows`, each representing a document with fields like `document_type`, `file`, `serial_id`, and `ref_type`. These rows are initialized from `formik.values.uploadDocuments`.
    *   `useRef` is employed to manage references to hidden file input elements for each row, enabling programmatic file selection.
    *   Functions `handleAddFile`, `handleFileChange`, `handleAddRow`, `handleDeleteRow`, `handleDocumentTypeChange`, and `handleDownload` provide the core functionality for managing the document table, including adding/removing rows, handling file input, updating document types, and downloading files.
    *   It deeply integrates with a Formik instance (`formik.setFieldValue`) to keep the form's `uploadDocuments` array in sync with the local table state.
    *   Several iterative changes refined the display logic for file names:
        *   Initially, it displayed `row.file.name` or "No file chosen" (12:33:32 PM).
        *   At 12:36:07 PM, `document_name` was explicitly added to the initial state mapping to preserve existing document names.
        *   Further refinements at 12:38:09 PM and 12:39:06 PM improved the `<span>` element displaying the chosen file name, eventually settling on `row.file?.name || row.document_name || "No file chosen"` to correctly show either the newly selected file's name or a pre-existing document name.
    *   A `console.log` for `formik.values.uploadDocuments` was added at 12:35:02 PM, indicating debugging efforts.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` (Timestamps: 10/16/2025, 12:41:58 PM and 10/16/2025, 12:42:16 PM)**
    *   This component provides a form for adding or updating GST location details for a customer.
    *   It uses `useFormik` for form state and submission. `initialValues` are populated from `location.state`, reflecting details like address, contact, and sales/customer service representatives.
    *   The `onSubmit` function constructs a `gstRow` object and dispatches `addOrUpdateGST` to a Redux store, then navigates back to the GST location page.
    *   Customer header information (ID, Name, Group, PAN No.) is displayed using data from `useGetCustomerDetailsQuery`.
    *   The form itself consists of numerous `InputBox`, `SelectBox`, and `AutocompleteSearch` components, organized into sections for address, contact, and sales/customer service representatives.
    *   At 12:42:16 PM, `slno: values.slno` was explicitly added to the `gstRow` object within the `onSubmit` function, correcting a previous omission or commented-out line.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Customer-Centric Development:** All changes revolve around enhancing the customer module, from detailed profiles to booking management and document handling.
*   **React Hooks and State Management:** Consistent use of `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for component-level state and side effects. Redux Toolkit and `react-redux` hooks (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) are central to application-wide state management and API interactions (`RTK Query`).
*   **Form Management with Formik:** Formik is heavily utilized for complex forms (`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`, and implicitly `UploadFiles.tsx` interacts with Formik's state), simplifying validation and submission logic.
*   **Modular UI Components:** The project leverages a consistent set of custom Tailwind CSS-based components (`PageWrapper`, `InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `AutocompleteSearch`, `Button`, `Badge`, `TMenu`) for building the user interface.
*   **Dynamic Data Grids:** Multiple files define column configurations for data grids, indicating a pattern of displaying various customer-related data in tabular form with custom cell rendering for enhanced user experience (e.g., badges for status, icons for services, action menus).
*   **Navigation State:** `react-router-dom`'s `useLocation` and `useNavigate` are frequently used, often passing complex state objects (`location.state`) between pages/components to maintain context (e.g., `customer_id`, `formAction`, `gstRow`).
*   **File Upload Logic:** A repeatable pattern for handling file uploads is evident in `UploadFiles.tsx`, featuring dynamic row management, hidden file inputs, and synchronization with parent form state.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The presence of numerous `console.log` statements throughout the code entries suggests active development, testing, and debugging.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Many changes occurred within a short time frame on 10/16/2025, indicating focused development activity on the customer features.

## 2:05:26 PM
The code changes primarily focus on a single file: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\customerService.ts`. All entries span a short period between 12:44:36 PM and 12:55:12 PM on October 16, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates (`customerService.ts`):**

*   **Initial State (10/16/2025, 12:44:36 PM):** The `CreateCustomer` function contained an incomplete or potentially erroneous destructuring assignment (`const {slno,isNew , ...restGstLocations} = gstLocations;`) followed by a loop that was seemingly intended to process `restGstLocations` but was only partially shown.
*   **Significant Update (10/16/2025, 12:45:18 PM):** This update rectified the `CreateCustomer` function's handling of GST locations.
    *   The problematic destructuring line `const {slno,isNew , ...restGstLocations} = gstLocations;` was removed.
    *   The subsequent `for` loop for GST locations was adjusted to directly iterate over `gstLocations ?? []`, ensuring all provided GST location data is processed.
    *   A new section was introduced, signaled by the comment `// ---------------- Key Personal Details ----------------`, which begins a `for (const kp` loop, indicating that the `CreateCustomer` function is being extended to also handle and insert "Key Personal Details" data.
*   **Subsequent Timestamps (10/16/2025, 12:45:36 PM to 12:55:12 PM):** All subsequent log entries for this file show identical code content to the 12:45:18 PM entry. This suggests that no further functional changes were applied or logged in these later commits within the provided snippets, or these were simply repetitive saves during active development without new diffs.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The primary functional change occurred between **10/16/2025, 12:44:36 PM** and **10/16/2025, 12:45:18 PM**.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   All logged modifications are confined to the `customerService.ts` file.
*   The changes are concentrated in the `CreateCustomer` asynchronous function, specifically related to parsing and processing incoming request body data (`gstLocationsRaw`, `keyPersonalDetailsRaw`, etc.), updating customer status, and inserting detailed information into the `customer_gst_location` table.
*   There's a consistent pattern of parsing JSON fields if they are received as strings (e.g., `gstLocations`, `keyPersonalDetails`).
*   The code snippets consistently end mid-function, specifically at the beginning of the "Key Personal Details" processing loop, implying that the `CreateCustomer` function was still under active development or being expanded to handle more data types.
*   The use of `await query("BEGIN")` and `await query("COMMIT")` (or `ROLLBACK` on error) indicates transactional database operations for data integrity within the `CreateCustomer` and `saveCustomerDetails` functions.
*   Audit logging (`simpleAudit`) is consistently performed after successful data insertion, for example, after a GST location is created.
