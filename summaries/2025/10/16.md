# Activity Summary for 10/16/2025

## 10:43:12 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\globalUpload.ts` was updated twice in rapid succession, on `10/15/2025, 6:37:28 PM` and `10/15/2025, 6:37:34 PM`.

This file defines a core utility function, `saveDoc`, designed to handle the saving of multiple uploaded documents. Key functionalities include:
*   **Interface Definition:** An `interface SaveDocParams` specifies the required parameters for `saveDoc`, including `ref_type`, `ref_id`, `remark` (optional), `uploaded_by`, `document_type`, and an array of `Express.Multer.File` objects.
*   **File Processing:** The `saveDoc` function iterates through an array of uploaded files, extracting `originalname`, `path`, and deriving `document_type` from the file's extension.
*   **Database Interaction:** It interacts with a database via a `query` function (imported from `./database`) to insert document metadata into a `document_upload` table. The `INSERT` statement captures `ref_type`, `ref_id`, `document_name`, `document_path`, `document_type`, `remark`, `uploaded_by`, and sets `uploaded_at` and `updated_at` to the current timestamp (`NOW()`).
*   **Error Handling:** A `try...catch` block is used to catch potential errors during the database operation, re-throwing the error message.
*   **Debugging/Logging:** A `console.log("===files123", files);` statement is present within the file iteration loop, likely for debugging purposes.

The content of the file remained identical across both timestamps, indicating that no functional code changes were introduced between the 6-second interval, suggesting either an immediate re-save or no substantive modification at that point. This module appears to be a central component for managing document uploads and their corresponding database records within the `envosys-backend` project.
