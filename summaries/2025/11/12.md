A new `SelectCustomerPanel` component has been introduced in `src/SelectCustomer.tsx`, last modified on 11/12/2025, 10:06:36 AM. This component provides a comprehensive customer selection interface.

**File-Specific Updates (`src/SelectCustomer.tsx`):**
*   **Core Functionality:** Implements a searchable, paginated dropdown for selecting customers.
*   **State Management:** Utilizes React's `useState` for local UI state (search query, current page, loading status, customer options) and integrates with Redux via `useDispatch` to update a global `setSelectedCustomer` state.
*   **API Integration:** Fetches paginated customer options from `ApiManager.getPaginatedCompanyOptions` with parameters for search, page, items per page, and role (`CUSTOMER`). The search functionality is debounced for performance.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Displays the currently selected customer (or "Select Customer") along with an avatar.
    *   The dropdown menu includes a header with a "Clear All" button, a search input field (with a magnifying glass icon), a list of customer results, and pagination controls.
    *   Handles loading states and displays "No results found" messages.
*   **Interaction Logic:** Key event handlers (`handleSearchChange`, `handlePageChange`, `handleCustomerChange`, `handleClearAll`) manage user input and state updates.
*   **Dropdown Persistence:** A notable pattern in the component is the extensive use of `e.stopPropagation()` on `onClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onKeyDown`, and `onFocus` events within the `DropdownMenu` and its internal interactive elements (search input, clear button). This pattern is crucial for preventing the dropdown from closing prematurely when users interact with the components inside the menu itself, enhancing usability.
*   **Styling:** The component leverages Tailwind CSS classes for its layout and visual presentation.
