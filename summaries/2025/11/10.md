# Activity Summary for 11/10/2025

## 11:00:13 AM
A `sample1.json` file was created or updated at 11/10/2025, 10:11:13 AM, containing a sample JSON object with user details including name, age, city, marital status, hobbies, and address. This file resides in the `\root\node\envosys\envosys_bucket\ai\upload` directory.

Subsequently, at 11/10/2025, 10:54:27 AM, the file `uploadRoutes.ts` was noted to be empty, suggesting its creation or a reset of its content.

The `server.ts` file underwent two rapid updates:
1.  At 11/10/2025, 10:55:18 AM, the `server.ts` file was significantly modified. It establishes an Express server, configures middleware (JSON and URL-encoded body parsing with a 10MB limit, CORS with broad access, and Morgan for logging), and sets up user authentication and registration routes (`/temp-auth/login` and `/api/users/add`). An authentication middleware is applied to `/api` routes, and a `BaseRouter` is integrated. Crucially, a new `/api/download/:filename` endpoint was introduced. This endpoint is designed to securely serve files from the `\root\node\envosys\envosys_bucket\ai\upload` directory, using `res.download()` for the file transfer and including error handling for file not found scenarios. The server also includes logic for connecting to a PostgreSQL database. A key omission in this version was the `path` module import, which would have caused an error for `path.join`.
2.  A quick follow-up update to `server.ts` occurred at 11/10/2025, 10:55:34 AM. This change specifically addressed the missing `path` module by adding `import path from "path";` at the top of the file, rectifying the error from the previous commit and making the file download functionality fully operational.

A recurring pattern observed is the consistent reference to the directory `\root\node\envosys\envosys_bucket\ai\upload`. This path is used for storing sample data (`sample1.json`), as a static file serving directory (`/uploads`), and as the designated source for the file download endpoint, indicating a central location for AI-related uploads or storage. The timestamps suggest a focused development session, rapidly adding significant backend functionality and immediately correcting an import error.
