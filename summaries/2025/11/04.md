# Activity Summary for 11/4/2025

## 9:31:42 AM
**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 3:44:37 PM)
This file defines the `getTableDataReports` controller function, which is responsible for fetching various analytics reports. It imports several specialized query builder functions (e.g., `chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`). The controller dynamically constructs a SQL query based on a `type` parameter received in the request, categorizing reports into groups such as chassis, booking & cargo-ready, containers, departures, and general metrics. It handles default date ranges, user and company context, and executes the generated query, returning the results. A significant portion of the code is dedicated to a large `if-else if` block that maps the `type` parameter to the appropriate query builder.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 5:05:37 PM)
This file sets up the API routes for operations related to OTM (Oracle Transportation Management) Bill of Lading (BOL). It exposes endpoints for: exporting excel data, fetching PLPO (Packing List/Proof of Delivery) by BOL, fetching payload, fetching by BOL number, editing OTM BOL, uploading and saving edits, fetching by a common key, generating XML, and sending data to OTM. A previously used file upload route (`/upload`) is commented out, suggesting a change in file upload handling or a temporary disablement.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM)
This utility file provides a collection of functions essential for analytics and reporting. Key functionalities include:
*   `defaultDateRange`: Generates a default one-year date range.

    *   Features include displaying calculated values with a `Badge`, showing detailed formulas via a `Tooltip`, exporting data to Excel (`FaFileExcel`) with column selection via a `ThemedModal` and `ColumnsSelector`, and exporting individual metric charts to PDF (`MdPictureAsPdf`) using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`.
    *   A fullscreen option (`FullscreenOutlined`) to enlarge the metric is also included.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx` (Updates between 11/3/2025, 5:58:14 PM and 11/3/2025, 5:59:43 PM):**
    *   This file adds the `GaugeChart` component, which renders a radial bar chart using `react-apexcharts`.
    *   It dynamically sets the gradient fill color based on whether the `value` is below a certain limit (e.g., green/dark gray for < 3 days, orange otherwise).
    *   The chart's value formatter displays data in "Days".
    *   Initial color choices for the gauge were experimented with, moving from green/orange to dark gray/orange.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx` (Initial commit at 11/3/2025, 6:05:49 PM):**
    *   Introduced `ViewContainer` for managing custom analytics dashboards (views).
    *   Allows users to create, edit, and delete views, specifying a title.
    *   Supports two types of views: "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise", selectable via a `RadioNav`.
    *   Metrics can be selected using a `TreeViewContainer`, with a limit of 9 metrics.
    *   Integrates API calls for fetching and saving dashboard configurations (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`).
    *   Includes a "Delete" option with a confirmation `PopupAlert` and an "Audit" feature displayed in an `AuditViewDrawer`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

## 10:38:48 AM
**File Path:** `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js`
**Timestamp:** `11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM`

This file, `methods.js`, serves as a central utility hub for analytics functionalities within the `t360-frontend` application. It includes functions for data processing, chart configuration, formula generation, date formatting, and crucially, Excel report generation.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **`TruncateText`:** A simple utility function to shorten text strings.
*   **`metricsPackageHandler`:** This is a core function for preparing metric data for display. It dynamically determines the chart type (e.g., `Count`, `StackedBar`, `Transit`, `General`) based on `customizer` settings. It also calculates aggregate values (Avg, Total, NA) for metrics and structures the output, including report name, column/row spans, and formatted data.
*   **Chart Configuration (`allChartOptions`, `chartOptionsByType`):** Defines the available chart types (bar, pie, line, stack, gauge) along with their corresponding Material-UI icons and categorizes them by chart behavior (General, StackBar, Transit, Count).
*   **`reportFormula`:** A function that generates dynamic formula strings based on the `reportName` and selected `dateColumns`. It handles specific cases like "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" and general date difference calculations.
*   **`weekDateFormater`:** Uses `moment.js` to format dates into a "D MMM" string.
*   **`downloadReportSpreadsheet`:** This extensive function handles the generation and download of Excel spreadsheets for various analytics reports using `exceljs` and `file-saver`.
    *   It meticulously constructs the report metadata, including metric name, client, and date ranges.
    *   Headers are dynamically adjusted based on `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) for "StackedBar" charts, and additional "View" headers are added for "transitBar" charts.
    *   The function contains significant conditional logic to map and populate report data into the Excel sheet based on the `chartType` and specific `reportName`. This includes handling standard charts with average/total calculations, as well as several distinct `StackedBar` report types like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped", "Total Spend per Month", and "Average Transit Time per Month".
    *   Data transformation occurs during mapping, such as splitting entities or extracting month names.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive use of `moment.js`** for date parsing and formatting across multiple functions, particularly for displaying date ranges and formatting individual dates.
*   **Heavy reliance on conditional logic (`if/else if`)** based on `customizer.chartType`, `item.reportName`, and `periodFilter` to dictate data processing, chart rendering, and Excel export structure. This pattern is prominent in both `metricsPackageHandler` and `downloadReportSpreadsheet` to adapt to diverse report types and data layouts.
*   **Dynamic Data Mapping:** Data from the backend is frequently transformed and formatted on the frontend, often by extracting specific properties from objects (`d.entity.split(",")`, `d["month"].split(" ")`) or applying numerical formatting, especially when preparing data for Excel.
*   **Excel Export Detail:** The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function demonstrates a highly granular approach to structuring Excel files, with specific column headers and data aggregation techniques tailored to each report type and period filter.
*   **Abrupt End:** The provided code snippet ends mid-way through a conditional block for the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function, indicating further `StackedBar` report definitions or other export logic might follow.

    *   This routing file for OTM Bill of Lading operations has several new endpoints.
    *   New GET routes include `/excel_data` for export, `/fetch_payload`, and `/fetch/:common_key`.
    *   New POST routes include `/` for editing, `/upload_save_edit`, `/generate_xml`, and `/send_to_otm`.
    *   A previous `/upload` route using `uploadMiddleware` is commented out, suggesting a refactoring or temporary deactivation of that specific upload mechanism, potentially replaced by `upload_save_edit`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM):**
    *   This utility file has received extensive new functionalities to support the enhanced analytics controller.
    *   `defaultDateRange` now calculates a date range of one year prior to the current date.
    *   `replaceValueInQuery` was refined for more robust column name handling.
    *   `getUserObject` was improved to handle company-specific user codes, especially for 'ADMIN' access, by querying the `mtr_user_master` table.
    *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` is a new function for generating dynamic `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses based on time periods (month, week, quarter) for aggregation.
    *   `getExcelSelectedColumns` is a new function that dynamically selects columns for Excel exports based on the report name (e.g., "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "BL Release KPI") and a booking flag, including a network days calculation.
    *   New utility functions `isValidDate` and `dateFilterOnExport` were added to validate and format date fields within datasets before export, ensuring data integrity and presentation.
    *   A comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` constant array was introduced, detailing the key and display name for a wide array of shipment and container-related fields for exports.

    *   **Initial Functionality**: The `getExportData` controller handles requests for exporting analytics data, distinguishing between booking and non-booking reports. It applies date filtering, retrieves user and company information, constructs dynamic SQL queries, and includes a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields. A specific filter for MBLwise TEU reports is implemented.
    *   **Key Changes & Issues**:
        *   Between 11:52:28 AM and 11:54:19 AM, there were significant structural issues, including duplicate interface definitions (`AnalyticsControllerQuery`), duplicate `replaceColumnHandler` functions (one commented out), and temporary incorrect or missing imports for the `query` utility and `nonBookingQuery`.
        *   By 11:56:23 AM, critical import issues (like `query` and `nonBookingQuery`) were resolved, but some inconsistencies such as unused `NextFunction` import and the duplicated, commented-out helper function persisted.
        *   Numerous `console.log` statements were added throughout this period, indicating active debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts` (11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM - 11:58:42 AM)**
    *   Introduced a `getMonthValue` helper for date conversion.
    *   Significantly expanded the `bookingQuery` function by adding complex SQL query strings for various report types, including "Booking Date to Actual Departure" (and its MBL Wise, Stacked Bar variations), "Booking Date to Estimated Departure", and "Booking Date to POD Arrival". These queries involve joining tracking and booking data, filtering by company name, date ranges, and handling specific date validation. Stacked bar queries include logic to categorize time differences into weeks (e.g., "Less than 1 week").
    *   The file content appeared truncated in the log at both timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts` (11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM - 1:29:32 PM)**
    *   **Core Functionality**: The `bookingQueryBuilder` function was introduced to dynamically generate SQL queries for various booking-related analytics reports. It utilizes helper functions like `getColumnsByCategory` and `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` to customize the query.
    *   **Type Safety Improvements**: A series of changes from 1:22:57 PM to 1:29:32 PM focused on enhancing type safety by defining explicit TypeScript interfaces (`Customizer`, `QueryBuilderI`, `CalColumn`, `CalColumnConfig`) for the function's arguments and internal data structures, particularly for the `customizer` object. Properties like `mblwise` and `chartType` were added to `Customizer`.
    *   The SQL queries within this builder focus on calculating average day differences between booking dates and various event dates (e.g., actual departure) and generating data for stacked bar charts.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts` (11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM - 12:08:25 PM)**
    *   The `getTableDataReports` controller acts as a central dispatcher, routing requests for different report types (chassis, booking, containers, departures, general) to their respective query builder functions.
    *   It handles default date ranges and retrieves user/company context.
    *   A massive `if-else if` block categorizes report `type` to call the appropriate `QueryBuilder` (e.g., `chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`).
    *   Includes `console.log` statements for debugging generated SQL queries.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts` (11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM - 12:16:36 PM)**
    *   **Core Functionality**: The `getContainerReports` controller generates container-related analytics, grouping data by a specified column (e.g., `country_of_origin`, `trucker`).
    *   **Query Logic**: Dynamically constructs SQL queries, joining with `portmaster` for country-based grouping or applying specific conditions for `trucker` (filtering `type_of_move`). It includes the "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" replacement logic.
    *   **Refactoring**: From 12:13:38 PM, the code was refactored with explicit interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) and descriptive comments to improve readability and maintainability.
    *   A `console.log("===reqquery",req.query);` was added for debugging at 12:16:36 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts` (11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM)**
    *   Defined API routes for analytics, including general views, dashboard metrics (list, save sequence, save size), and specific reports like Excel export, TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and Tables Data.
    *   Includes a redundant `AnalyticsRoutes.get(Paths.Analytics.Get,getAll);` entry.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts` (11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM - 5:08:26 PM)**

## 11:38:49 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js` was updated on 11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM. This file contains a collection of utility functions and handlers primarily focused on processing, displaying, and exporting analytics data within a frontend application.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Utility Functions:**
    *   `TruncateText`: A simple utility to shorten text strings and append an ellipsis.
    *   `weekDateFormater`: Formats a given date into a "D MMM" string using `moment.js`.
*   **Analytics Data Processing (`metricsPackageHandler`):**
    *   This function is central to preparing analytics data for display. It determines the appropriate chart type (e.g., `Count`, `Stackbar`, `Transit`, `General`) based on metric customizer settings.
    *   It calculates summary values (Average, Total, or N/A) based on the `calType` specified in the metric's customizer, handling cases where certain chart types are not allowed for calculations.
    *   It also determines the correct formatting settings (e.g., "days", "t360volume") for the data.
*   **Chart Configuration:**
    *   `allChartOptions`: An array defining available chart types (bar, pie, line, stack, gauge) with corresponding Material-UI icons.
    *   `chartOptionsByType`: An object mapping broader chart categories (`General`, `StackBar`, `Transit`, `Count`) to specific chart keys from `allChartOptions`.
*   **Report Formula Generation (`reportFormula`):**
    *   Dynamically generates mathematical formulas based on the `reportName` and `dateColumns` provided in the customizer. It includes specific logic for "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" and a general case for two date columns.
*   **Excel Report Export (`downloadReportSpreadsheet`):**
    *   This asynchronous function handles the generation and download of detailed Excel spreadsheets for analytics reports using `exceljs` and `file-saver`.
    *   It populates report metadata (Metric, Client, Dates) and dynamically adjusts headers based on `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) and `chartType` (specifically for "StackedBar" and "transitBar").
    *   The function contains extensive conditional logic to populate data rows differently based on the `chartType` and specific `reportName`. For "StackedBar" reports, it accounts for various period filters (month, week, quarter) and report-specific data structures like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)", "Total Spend per Month ($)", "Average Transit Time per Month (Days)", and "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (Stacked Bar +/- 10 Days)", extracting relevant columns like "Less than 1 week", "This Quarter", "Less than 10 days", etc.
    *   It also appends summary rows (Average, Total, or N/A) based on the calculated `calType` and `calValue`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Conditional Logic based on Chart/Report Type:** A significant pattern is the frequent use of `item?.customizer?.chartType` and `item.reportName` to drive conditional logic, especially for data processing and Excel report generation. This indicates a highly configurable analytics system with tailored handling for different visual and data representations.
*   **Date and Period Filtering:** `moment.js` is consistently used for date formatting. `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) is a recurring variable used to structure data and headers differently for time-series reports.
*   **Calculation Types:** The concept of `calType` (Avg, NA, Total) and `calValue` is used across both data preparation (`metricsPackageHandler`) and report export (`downloadReportSpreadsheet`) for consistent summary calculations.
*   **ExcelJS for Dynamic Reports:** The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function exemplifies a robust use of `exceljs` to programmatically construct complex spreadsheets, adapting headers and data content based on various report parameters.

## 11:38:52 AM

    The `getTableDataReports` function has been substantially expanded to handle a much wider array of analytics report types. It now incorporates a more sophisticated `getUserObject` to retrieve user and company-specific data for query building. The controller uses dedicated query builders (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`) to construct database queries based on the requested report `type`. Numerous new report types have been added, particularly focusing on 'booking & cargo-ready' metrics such as `BookingDatetoActualDeparture`, `CargoReadyDatetoEstDepartureDate`, `ContainerShippedMblWise`, and `TotalSpendPerMonth`, indicating a deep dive into logistics performance analysis. A `codeCustomization` flag was introduced, suggesting some reports might involve direct data processing logic instead of standard query execution.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 5:05:37 PM):**
    New API endpoints have been added to support OTM (Oracle Transportation Management or similar) Bill of Lading (BOL) functionalities. These include routes for exporting Excel data (`/excel_data`), fetching payloads (`/fetch_payload`), fetching by common key (`/fetch/:common_key`), uploading and saving edits (`/upload_save_edit`), generating XML (`/generate_xml`), and sending data to OTM (`/send_to_otm`). An existing `"/upload"` route remains commented out, possibly for future use or an alternative upload method.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM):**
    This utility file has been significantly augmented to support the extended analytics capabilities.
    *   `defaultDateRange`: A function was added to provide a default one-year date range for reports.

    *   `getUserObject`: Introduced to build a user context object, fetching `usercode` based on `companyname` and `access` level.
    *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: A function was added to generate `groupBy`, `orderBy`, `dateTrunc`, and `select` clauses based on time granularities like month, week, or quarter.
    *   `getExcelSelectedColumns`: A crucial function was added to dynamically select relevant columns for Excel exports based on the specific `reportName` and whether it's a booking-related report, defining common, booking, and other columns. Specific logic for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (Stacked Bar /- 10 Days)" and "BL Release KPI" is present.
    *   `isValidDate`: A utility function to validate date strings, ensuring they are not invalid JavaScript dates, too old (pre-1973), or a specific '0000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z' value.
    *   `dateFilterOnExport`: A function to process data arrays, filtering out invalid dates from a comprehensive list of date-related keys and optionally formatting valid dates for display.
    *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A large constant array was defined, mapping keys to user-friendly column names for comprehensive Excel export functionality, covering a wide range of logistics data points from file details to container and booking specifics.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes reveal a strong focus on enhancing the application's analytical reporting capabilities and integrating with external systems like OTM.

1.  **Analytics Deep Dive:** There's a clear pattern of expanding the variety and depth of analytics reports, moving from general metrics to highly specific logistics KPIs like "Chassis PU date Vs Final Delivery Date Mbl Wise" or "Booking Date to Est Departure Date Stacked Bar".
2.  **Date and Time Granularity:** Extensive work has been done on handling dates and time, including default ranges, specific date validation, and dynamic filtering/grouping by month, week, or quarter, indicating a robust approach to time-series data analysis.

    *   **Layout and Responsiveness**: The `max-w` (max-width) property of the main container was repeatedly adjusted, ranging from `520px` to `1200px`, eventually settling around `1150px` with a `ml-[-6px]` offset. This indicates fine-tuning for different display sizes.
    *   **Button Styling**: Both the main option buttons and the "New" button chip saw numerous updates to their Tailwind CSS classes. This included changes to fixed `width` and `height` (e.g., `w-[180px] h-[40px]`, `min-w-[160px] h-[42px]`), border-radius (`rounded-full`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, `rounded-md`), shadow effects (`shadow-[0_4px_6px...]`, `shadow-[0_1px_3px...]`), content alignment (`justify-between`, `justify-center`), background colors (`bg-blue-600`, `bg-gray-100`, `bg-white`, `var(--Background-backgroundHoverOverlay...)`), text colors, and hover states.
    *   **Icon Integration**: The `Option` interface was extended to support `icon` props, allowing icons to be displayed within the tab buttons. The placement and styling of these icons within the buttons were also refined (e.g., `ml-3`, `mr-2`, `ml-4`).
    *   **Scroll Button Icons**: The `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` icons used for horizontal scrolling had their `fontSize` property gradually increased from `small` to `large` and their color classes adjusted (e.g., from `text-gray-600 hover:text-black` to `text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700`).
    *   **Structural Reorder**: At 2:57:06 PM, the order of the optional button chip and the regular options map within the scrollable container was swapped.
    *   **Debugging**: `console.log` statements were added (6:03 PM - 6:04 PM) to inspect the component's `options` and `value` props.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**:
    *   **ChipsTabView Integration**: At 2:56:23 PM, the `ChipsTabView` component was integrated to manage dashboard views. This involved mapping dashboard items to `label`/`value` for the `ChipsTabView` and configuring a "New" button with an `AddCircleOutlineOutlined` icon.
    *   **Icon Imports**: There were several minor changes related to importing various icons (e.g., `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, `PlusIcon`, `PresentationChartLineIcon`, `ShowChart`, `HiPresentationChartLine`) from different UI libraries (`@heroicons/react`, `@mui/icons-material`, `react-icons/bs`, `react-icons/fa6`, `react-icons/md`, `react-icons/hi2`). Some icons were imported, then removed, and later re-imported from different variants or libraries (e.g., `PresentationChartLineIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` to `@heroicons/react/24/solid`).

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**: No significant code changes were logged within the provided snippets for this file. It maintains its functionality for drag-and-drop metric management, resizing, and fetching report data.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`**: No code changes were logged within the provided snippets for this file. It remains responsible for PDF/Excel exports, displaying calculated values, and managing the enlarge state of metrics.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx`**: This file saw focused changes between 5:58 PM and 5:59 PM.
    *   **Color Scheme Adjustment**: The `fill` gradient `colors` and `gradientToColors` for the `GaugeChart` were modified. Specifically, the color for when `isValueBelowLimit` (value < 3) transitioned from various shades of green (`#008000`, `#32f63b`) to darker gray/black tones (`#09090B`, `#595959`).

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**: No significant code changes were logged within the provided snippets for this file. It continues to manage custom dashboard views (add/edit/delete), metric selection via tabs and checkboxes, and interaction with an analytics API. Debugging `console.log` statements were present for `viewTitle` and `viewOptions`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative UI/UX Development**: The numerous, rapid changes in `chip-tabs-view.tsx` underscore a highly iterative process for refining the visual design and user experience of a single component. This includes frequent adjustments to dimensions, spacing, colors, and interactive states using Tailwind CSS classes.
*   **Component Reusability and Integration**: The `ChipsTabView` component, once refined, was integrated into `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, demonstrating a modular approach to frontend development.
*   **State Management**: Redux is consistently used across analytics-related components (`AnalyticsToolbar`, `analyticsContainer`) for managing application state.
*   **API Interaction**: RTK Query hooks are employed for efficient data fetching and mutation operations with the backend, evident in `analyticsContainer` and `ViewContainer`.
*   **PDF Generation**: Functionality for generating PDF reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` is a recurring theme in `AnalyticsToolbar` and `MetricFooter`.
*   **Debugging**: The presence of `console.log` statements in various components suggests an active debugging phase during development.
*   **Icon Diversity**: The use of icons from multiple libraries indicates a preference for specific icon styles or availability, or perhaps a transition between different icon sets.

## 11:39:31 AM
The codebase underwent a series of focused updates on November 3, 2025, primarily affecting analytics reporting services and user management functionalities. Key themes include the refinement of SQL query generation, a push towards improved type safety with new interfaces, and consistent logging for debugging and operational insights.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**:
    *   **Initial state (11:51:04 AM):** Defined `getExportData` to handle booking and non-booking reports, including date handling, user/company object retrieval, dynamic column selection, and a `replaceColumnHandler` to normalize port names (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES"). It also included specific logic for MBL-wise TEU filtering.
    *   **Brief Regression/Debugging (11:52:28 AM - 11:52:44 AM):** Temporarily changed the database `query` import path from `@src/common/util/database` to `@src/common/db`, added `NextFunction` to express imports, and duplicated or re-introduced an older `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface. Debugging `console.log` statements were added in the catch block.
    *   **Refinement/Correction (11:54:19 AM - 11:56:23 AM):** The database `query` import path was corrected back to `@src/common/util/database`. The `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface was simplified by removing `companyname` and `access` fields (suggesting they are now accessed directly from `req.query`). The `ExportDataRow` interface was removed from this file. The `replaceColumnHandler` function's type signature was adjusted to use `any` for item properties. Extensive `console.log` statements were added for various request parameters, user codes, and generated SQL queries, indicating active debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**:
    *   **Consistent Structure (11:58:36 AM - 11:58:42 AM):** This file defines `getMonthValue` and `bookingQuery`, which generates dynamic SQL snippets for various booking-related analytics reports. It includes conditional logic for "Stacked Bar" reports based on `displayBy` (month, week, quarter) and `stackedGroup`. A filter `m.t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date IS NOT NULL` was added to "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)".

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**:
    *   **Type Safety Evolution (12:00:20 PM - 1:29:32 PM):** The `bookingQueryBuilder` function was consistently present, generating complex SQL for various booking and cargo-ready reports. However, between **1:22:57 PM** and **1:29:32 PM**, significant improvements were made to its type definitions. New interfaces like `Customizer`, `QueryBuilderI`, `CalColumn`, and `CalColumnConfig` were introduced and progressively refined. This enhanced type safety and code clarity without changing the core query generation logic.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**:
    *   **Centralized Reporting (12:02:23 PM):** Introduced `getTableDataReports` as a central service to dispatch to various query builders (chassis, booking, container, departure, general) based on the `type` of report requested. This service handles default date ranges, retrieves user/company info, and logs the final SQL query before execution.
    *   **Debugging (12:08:25 PM):** Added `console.log(error)` in the catch block for error visibility.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**:
    *   **Query Building and Refactoring (12:11:01 PM - 12:16:36 PM):** The `getContainerReports` function dynamically builds SQL queries for container-related reports, grouping by different columns (e.g., country, trucker). It applies port name normalization using `replaceValueInQuery`.
    *   **Type Safety and Readability (12:13:38 PM):** Introduced `ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, and `AnalyticsRow` interfaces for better type enforcement and organized the logic into clearer sections ("Case 1: Group by Country", "Case 2: Other columns").
    *   **Debugging (12:16:36 PM):** Added `console.log("===reqquery",req.query);` for immediate inspection of incoming request parameters.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**:
    *   **Expanded Analytics Endpoints (12:21:34 PM):** Registered a comprehensive set of GET and POST endpoints for various analytics features, including core view management, metric lists, sequence/size saving, Excel exports, and specific reports for TEU, CBM, KGS, containers, and transit times. This shows a significant expansion of the analytics module.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\UserService.ts`**:
    *   **User Management (3:39:14 PM):** A substantial update or introduction of a service encompassing user `login`, `saveUserPreferences`, `fetchUserPreferences`, `saveInviteLog`, `fetchAllCompanyUser`, and `userSettings`. This service handles user authentication, JWT token creation, and database interactions for user profile and invitation management. It uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for preferences and invites.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\index.ts`**:
    *   **Route Integration (3:39:25 PM):** The main application router was updated to include the newly defined `UserRoutes` and `AnalyticsRoutes`, signifying the integration of these features into the application's API.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\teuService.ts`**:
    *   **TEU Reporting (4:32:00 PM):** Introduced `getTEUReports` to calculate and report Twenty-foot Equivalent Units. It dynamically generates SQL queries for TEU based on grouping columns, including complex logic for extracting numeric container types and normalizing port names (e.g., handling "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" within the query itself).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\coreMetricService.ts`**:
    *   **Dashboard Configuration (4:32:31 PM - 4:49:23 PM):** This service was introduced to manage dashboard metrics. It provides `dashboardEndPointList` (fetches ordered metrics for a dashboard), `getMetricList` (categorizes available metrics and handles preloading selected ones), `saveSequence` (saves the order of metrics), and `saveSize` (saves column/row spans for metrics). This centralizes the backend logic for analytics dashboard customization. Debugging `console.log`s were added in catch blocks.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**:
    *   **Core Utilities (1:22:26 PM - 5:08:26 PM):** This utility file remained stable during the observed period, providing common functions such as `defaultDateRange`, `replaceValueInQuery` (for port name normalization in queries), `getUserObject` (for user/company data), `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` (for date-based SQL filtering), `getExcelSelectedColumns` (dynamic column selection for exports), and `dateFilterOnExport` (date validation and formatting for exports). It also defines `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** A consistent pattern across multiple services (`analyticsExportService`, `booking.query`, `containerService`, `teuService`) is the dynamic construction of complex SQL queries based on various request parameters to support flexible analytics reporting.
*   **Port Name Normalization:** The replacement of "LONG BEACH" with "LOS ANGELES" is a recurring data cleansing step, appearing in `analyticsExportService`, `containerService`, and `teuService` either as a post-query handler or directly within the SQL query.
*   **Type Safety Enhancements:** There's a clear and continuous effort, particularly evident in `booking.query.ts` and `containerService.ts`, to introduce and refine TypeScript interfaces for function parameters and data structures. This significantly improves code maintainability and reduces potential bugs.
*   **Extensive Logging:** `logger.info` and `logger.error` are widely used for debugging, tracing execution flow, and error reporting across almost all modified files. `console.log` is also frequently used for immediate debugging during development.
*   **Default Date Range:** The `defaultDateRange` utility is consistently applied in reporting services when date parameters are missing.
*   **User Context Retrieval:** The `getUserObject` utility is repeatedly called to extract user-specific and company-specific information required for database queries.
*   **Database Interaction:** All services interact with a PostgreSQL database using a shared `query` utility, applying parameters to construct SQL queries.

## 12:38:50 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js` was updated on `11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM`. This file primarily contains utility functions and logic for handling analytics data, chart configurations, and generating reports, specifically Excel spreadsheets.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Imports:** The file imports various libraries and modules including `moment` for date handling, UI components from `@mui/icons-material`, enums for `AnalyticsChartType`, configuration constants like `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`, `ExcelJS` for Excel generation, `file-saver` for downloading files, and `ApiManager` for API interactions.
*   **`TruncateText`:** A utility function was introduced to shorten text strings and append an ellipsis.
*   **`metricsPackageHandler`:** This core function processes raw metric data, dynamically determining the chart type (`Count`, `StackedBar`, `Transit`, `General`), calculating aggregate values (Average, Total) based on customizer settings, and formatting data for presentation. It integrates report names, column/row spans, and applies specific header configurations.
*   **Chart Configuration:**
    *   `allChartOptions`: An array listing available chart types (bar, pie, line, stack, gauge) with their respective Material-UI icons.
    *   `chartOptionsByType`: An object mapping broader chart categories (e.g., `General`, `StackBar`) to the specific chart options they support.
*   **`reportFormula`:** A function for constructing mathematical formulas based on report names and selected date columns, with specific logic for "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time".
*   **`weekDateFormater`:** A simple utility to format dates into "D MMM" using `moment`.
*   **`downloadReportSpreadsheet`:** An extensive asynchronous function responsible for generating and downloading Excel reports.
    *   It meticulously constructs the report array, including report metadata (Metric, Client, Dates) and headers.
    *   Headers are adjusted based on `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) and `chartType`.
    *   Data population logic is highly conditional, differentiating based on `chartType` and specific `reportName`. For non-stacked bar charts, it includes average/total calculations.
    *   For `StackedBar` charts, it has distinct handling for reports like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)", "Total Spend per Month ($)", "Average Transit Time per Month (Days)", and "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (Stacked Bar +/- 10 Days)", mapping data fields according to the chosen period filter (month, week, quarter). The provided log ends mid-way through the conditional logic for `StackedBar` reports.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dynamic Customization:** A strong pattern of using a `customizer` object to drive the behavior and appearance of analytics reports and charts, including chart types, calculation methods, and date columns.
*   **Chart Type-Specific Logic:** Extensive use of conditional statements (`if/else if`) throughout the code to adapt data processing, formatting, and report generation based on the `chartType` (e.g., `StackedBar`, `Transit`, `Count`, `General`).
*   **Period Filtering:** The concept of `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) is a recurring theme, particularly in `downloadReportSpreadsheet` where it dictates how data is grouped and presented in stacked bar charts.
*   **Excel Report Generation:** The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function demonstrates a highly structured and repetitive approach to building Excel worksheets, populating cells based on various report types and data structures.
*   **Moment.js Integration:** `moment` is consistently used for date formatting and manipulation across different functions.
*   **Modular Design:** The file is composed of multiple exported functions, indicating a modular approach to organizing analytics-related functionalities.
