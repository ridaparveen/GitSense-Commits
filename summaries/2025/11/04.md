# Activity Summary for 11/4/2025

## 9:31:42 AM
**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 3:44:37 PM)
This file defines the `getTableDataReports` controller function, which is responsible for fetching various analytics reports. It imports several specialized query builder functions (e.g., `chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`). The controller dynamically constructs a SQL query based on a `type` parameter received in the request, categorizing reports into groups such as chassis, booking & cargo-ready, containers, departures, and general metrics. It handles default date ranges, user and company context, and executes the generated query, returning the results. A significant portion of the code is dedicated to a large `if-else if` block that maps the `type` parameter to the appropriate query builder.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 5:05:37 PM)
This file sets up the API routes for operations related to OTM (Oracle Transportation Management) Bill of Lading (BOL). It exposes endpoints for: exporting excel data, fetching PLPO (Packing List/Proof of Delivery) by BOL, fetching payload, fetching by BOL number, editing OTM BOL, uploading and saving edits, fetching by a common key, generating XML, and sending data to OTM. A previously used file upload route (`/upload`) is commented out, suggesting a change in file upload handling or a temporary disablement.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM)
This utility file provides a collection of functions essential for analytics and reporting. Key functionalities include:
*   `defaultDateRange`: Generates a default one-year date range.
*   `replaceValueInQuery`: A helper to conditionally modify column values in SQL queries, specifically for 'pod' or 'place_of_delivery'.
*   `getUserObject`: Retrieves user and company-specific information, including handling admin-level access for usercode overrides.
*   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for aggregating data by month, week, or quarter, based on the `displayBy` parameter.
*   `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Dynamically selects specific columns for Excel exports, with special handling for reports like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" (calculating network days) and "BL Release KPI" (adjusting release dates for weekends).
*   `isValidDate` and `dateFilterOnExport`: Functions to validate and format date strings for display and export, ensuring invalid dates are nullified and valid ones are formatted as "MM/DD/YYYY".
*   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A comprehensive array defining the key-name mapping for standard columns used in Excel exports, covering various shipment, container, and date-related fields.

**Summary of Key Information, Significant Changes, and Patterns:**

All logged changes occurred on **November 3, 2025**, indicating a focused period of development or updates.

*   **Analytics Feature Enhancement:** A major theme across `others.controller.ts` and `analytics.ts` is the expansion and refinement of analytics capabilities. This involves dynamic SQL query construction based on various report types, sophisticated date calculations (e.g., network days, weekend adjustments for BL release), and robust data preparation for Excel exports, including column selection and date formatting. The architecture uses a modular approach with dedicated query builders for different analytics categories.
*   **Date-Centric Operations:** There's a strong recurring pattern of handling dates for filtering, aggregation, and display. Functions for default date ranges, date validation, and date formatting are central to the analytics utilities.
*   **Dynamic Query Generation & Reporting:** The system extensively uses parameters like `type` and `displayBy` to dynamically build database queries and customize report outputs, specifically for different time granularities (month, week, quarter) and report names.
*   **OTM Integration:** `otm_bol.route.ts` highlights ongoing development related to OTM integration, covering data exchange (payload fetching, XML generation) and management of Bill of Lading information. The commented-out upload route suggests an evolving strategy for handling OTM-related file uploads.
*   **Logistics/Shipping Domain:** The terminology and types of reports (Chassis, Booking, Container, Departure KPIs, BOL, POL, POD, MBL, ETA, ETD) consistently point to an application heavily involved in logistics and shipping operations.

The provided log details frequent iterative changes to UI components and the introduction of new analytics features.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx` (Frequent updates between 11/3/2025, 2:50:09 PM and 11/3/2025, 6:04:54 PM):**
    *   This file underwent numerous styling adjustments for the `ChipsTabView` component. This included changes to:
        *   The overall `max-width` of the component, progressively increasing from `520px` to `1150px` (with some temporary larger values like `1200px`) and some relative positioning adjustments (`ml-[-4px]`, `ml-[-6px]`).
        *   The `gap` between chips, fluctuating between `gap-2` and `gap-3`.
        *   The appearance of individual chip buttons and the "New" button, specifically their `border-radius` (e.g., `rounded-full`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-xl`), `padding` (`py-1.5` vs `py-2`), `width`, `min-width`, `height`, and `shadow` effects.
        *   Color schemes for active and inactive chips, including a temporary shift to a dark active background which was later reverted.
        *   The placement of icons within chip buttons (moving from `{icon} {label}` to `<span>{label}</span> <span className="text-gray-500">{icon}</span>`).
        *   The order of the "New" button relative to other options in the scrollable container was swapped.
        *   The size of the scroll Chevron icons (from `small` to `large`).
        *   Several `console.log` statements were added and modified to debug options and values passed to the component.
    *   The `Option` interface was updated to explicitly include `icon?: React.ReactNode;`.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` (Updates between 11/3/2025, 2:56:23 PM and 11/3/2025, 5:11:25 PM):**
    *   This file primarily focuses on the `AnalyticsToolbar` component, which includes controls for the analytics dashboard.
    *   Significant additions include a robust PDF export functionality for the entire dashboard using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`, complete with a `getBase64Image` utility for handling the logo.
    *   It integrates Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) to manage global filters, selected dashboards, and operation types.
    *   Imports for various icon libraries (`@mui/icons-material`, `@heroicons/react`, `react-icons`) were frequently added and adjusted, indicating an evolving set of UI icons. `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, `PlusIcon`, and `PresentationChartLineIcon` from `@heroicons` were added and/or repositioned in imports, alongside `HiPresentationChartLine` from `react-icons/hi2`.
    *   Numerous entries show no code changes, suggesting frequent saves or minor, undetailed edits.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx` (Updates between 11/3/2025, 4:52:06 PM and 11/3/2025, 4:53:29 PM):**
    *   This file introduces the `AnalyticsContainer` component, which is responsible for rendering and managing individual metric widgets on a dashboard.
    *   It implements drag-and-drop functionality using `react-dnd` (`HTML5Backend`) to reorder metrics (`moveItem`).
    *   It supports resizing of metric widgets (`saveSize`) and changing their view type (chart/table) (`saveView`).
    *   API interactions (`useLazyFetchReportQuery`, `useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`) are set up for fetching report data and persisting layout changes.
    *   `moment.js` is used for date formatting in API calls.
    *   Extensive Redux integration is present for managing metrics and filter states.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx` (Initial commit at 11/3/2025, 5:16:09 PM):**
    *   Introduced the `MetricFooter` component, providing actions and information at the bottom of individual metric boxes.
    *   Features include displaying calculated values with a `Badge`, showing detailed formulas via a `Tooltip`, exporting data to Excel (`FaFileExcel`) with column selection via a `ThemedModal` and `ColumnsSelector`, and exporting individual metric charts to PDF (`MdPictureAsPdf`) using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`.
    *   A fullscreen option (`FullscreenOutlined`) to enlarge the metric is also included.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx` (Updates between 11/3/2025, 5:58:14 PM and 11/3/2025, 5:59:43 PM):**
    *   This file adds the `GaugeChart` component, which renders a radial bar chart using `react-apexcharts`.
    *   It dynamically sets the gradient fill color based on whether the `value` is below a certain limit (e.g., green/dark gray for < 3 days, orange otherwise).
    *   The chart's value formatter displays data in "Days".
    *   Initial color choices for the gauge were experimented with, moving from green/orange to dark gray/orange.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx` (Initial commit at 11/3/2025, 6:05:49 PM):**
    *   Introduced `ViewContainer` for managing custom analytics dashboards (views).
    *   Allows users to create, edit, and delete views, specifying a title.
    *   Supports two types of views: "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise", selectable via a `RadioNav`.
    *   Metrics can be selected using a `TreeViewContainer`, with a limit of 9 metrics.
    *   Integrates API calls for fetching and saving dashboard configurations (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`).
    *   Includes a "Delete" option with a confirmation `PopupAlert` and an "Audit" feature displayed in an `AuditViewDrawer`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative UI/UX Refinement:** A prominent pattern is the rapid and detailed iteration on UI elements, especially visible in `chip-tabs-view.tsx`. This suggests an active development phase focused on optimizing the look, feel, and responsiveness of user interface components, often involving micro-adjustments to CSS classes.
*   **Redux for State Management:** All major new or updated components (`AnalyticsToolbar`, `analyticsContainer`, `MetricFooter`, `ViewContainer`) leverage `react-redux` for managing complex application state, indicating a consistent architectural choice for state handling across the analytics section.
*   **API Integration with RTK Query:** The use of RTK Query hooks (e.g., `useLazyFetchReportQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`) is consistent across components that interact with the backend, demonstrating a standardized approach to data fetching and mutations.
*   **PDF Generation:** The repeated use of `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` in both `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` and `MetricFooter.tsx` for exporting content to PDF highlights a key feature and a shared utility pattern within the analytics module.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The presence of `console.log` statements throughout the code, often modified in subsequent commits, points to active debugging and verification during development.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The creation of distinct components like `ChipsTabView`, `AnalyticsToolbar`, `AnalyticsContainer`, `MetricFooter`, `GaugeChart`, and `ViewContainer` under the `analytics` and `common` directories reflects a modular and organized approach to frontend development.
