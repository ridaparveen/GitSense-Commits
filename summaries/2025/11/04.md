# Activity Summary for 11/4/2025

## 9:31:42 AM
**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 3:44:37 PM)
This file defines the `getTableDataReports` controller function, which is responsible for fetching various analytics reports. It imports several specialized query builder functions (e.g., `chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`). The controller dynamically constructs a SQL query based on a `type` parameter received in the request, categorizing reports into groups such as chassis, booking & cargo-ready, containers, departures, and general metrics. It handles default date ranges, user and company context, and executes the generated query, returning the results. A significant portion of the code is dedicated to a large `if-else if` block that maps the `type` parameter to the appropriate query builder.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 5:05:37 PM)
This file sets up the API routes for operations related to OTM (Oracle Transportation Management) Bill of Lading (BOL). It exposes endpoints for: exporting excel data, fetching PLPO (Packing List/Proof of Delivery) by BOL, fetching payload, fetching by BOL number, editing OTM BOL, uploading and saving edits, fetching by a common key, generating XML, and sending data to OTM. A previously used file upload route (`/upload`) is commented out, suggesting a change in file upload handling or a temporary disablement.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM)
This utility file provides a collection of functions essential for analytics and reporting. Key functionalities include:
*   `defaultDateRange`: Generates a default one-year date range.

    *   Features include displaying calculated values with a `Badge`, showing detailed formulas via a `Tooltip`, exporting data to Excel (`FaFileExcel`) with column selection via a `ThemedModal` and `ColumnsSelector`, and exporting individual metric charts to PDF (`MdPictureAsPdf`) using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`.
    *   A fullscreen option (`FullscreenOutlined`) to enlarge the metric is also included.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx` (Updates between 11/3/2025, 5:58:14 PM and 11/3/2025, 5:59:43 PM):**
    *   This file adds the `GaugeChart` component, which renders a radial bar chart using `react-apexcharts`.
    *   It dynamically sets the gradient fill color based on whether the `value` is below a certain limit (e.g., green/dark gray for < 3 days, orange otherwise).
    *   The chart's value formatter displays data in "Days".
    *   Initial color choices for the gauge were experimented with, moving from green/orange to dark gray/orange.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx` (Initial commit at 11/3/2025, 6:05:49 PM):**
    *   Introduced `ViewContainer` for managing custom analytics dashboards (views).
    *   Allows users to create, edit, and delete views, specifying a title.
    *   Supports two types of views: "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise", selectable via a `RadioNav`.
    *   Metrics can be selected using a `TreeViewContainer`, with a limit of 9 metrics.
    *   Integrates API calls for fetching and saving dashboard configurations (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`).
    *   Includes a "Delete" option with a confirmation `PopupAlert` and an "Audit" feature displayed in an `AuditViewDrawer`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

## 10:38:48 AM
**File Path:** `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js`
**Timestamp:** `11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM`

This file, `methods.js`, serves as a central utility hub for analytics functionalities within the `t360-frontend` application. It includes functions for data processing, chart configuration, formula generation, date formatting, and crucially, Excel report generation.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **`TruncateText`:** A simple utility function to shorten text strings.
*   **`metricsPackageHandler`:** This is a core function for preparing metric data for display. It dynamically determines the chart type (e.g., `Count`, `StackedBar`, `Transit`, `General`) based on `customizer` settings. It also calculates aggregate values (Avg, Total, NA) for metrics and structures the output, including report name, column/row spans, and formatted data.
*   **Chart Configuration (`allChartOptions`, `chartOptionsByType`):** Defines the available chart types (bar, pie, line, stack, gauge) along with their corresponding Material-UI icons and categorizes them by chart behavior (General, StackBar, Transit, Count).
*   **`reportFormula`:** A function that generates dynamic formula strings based on the `reportName` and selected `dateColumns`. It handles specific cases like "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" and general date difference calculations.
*   **`weekDateFormater`:** Uses `moment.js` to format dates into a "D MMM" string.
*   **`downloadReportSpreadsheet`:** This extensive function handles the generation and download of Excel spreadsheets for various analytics reports using `exceljs` and `file-saver`.
    *   It meticulously constructs the report metadata, including metric name, client, and date ranges.
    *   Headers are dynamically adjusted based on `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) for "StackedBar" charts, and additional "View" headers are added for "transitBar" charts.
    *   The function contains significant conditional logic to map and populate report data into the Excel sheet based on the `chartType` and specific `reportName`. This includes handling standard charts with average/total calculations, as well as several distinct `StackedBar` report types like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped", "Total Spend per Month", and "Average Transit Time per Month".
    *   Data transformation occurs during mapping, such as splitting entities or extracting month names.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive use of `moment.js`** for date parsing and formatting across multiple functions, particularly for displaying date ranges and formatting individual dates.
*   **Heavy reliance on conditional logic (`if/else if`)** based on `customizer.chartType`, `item.reportName`, and `periodFilter` to dictate data processing, chart rendering, and Excel export structure. This pattern is prominent in both `metricsPackageHandler` and `downloadReportSpreadsheet` to adapt to diverse report types and data layouts.
*   **Dynamic Data Mapping:** Data from the backend is frequently transformed and formatted on the frontend, often by extracting specific properties from objects (`d.entity.split(",")`, `d["month"].split(" ")`) or applying numerical formatting, especially when preparing data for Excel.
*   **Excel Export Detail:** The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function demonstrates a highly granular approach to structuring Excel files, with specific column headers and data aggregation techniques tailored to each report type and period filter.
*   **Abrupt End:** The provided code snippet ends mid-way through a conditional block for the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function, indicating further `StackedBar` report definitions or other export logic might follow.

    *   This routing file for OTM Bill of Lading operations has several new endpoints.
    *   New GET routes include `/excel_data` for export, `/fetch_payload`, and `/fetch/:common_key`.
    *   New POST routes include `/` for editing, `/upload_save_edit`, `/generate_xml`, and `/send_to_otm`.
    *   A previous `/upload` route using `uploadMiddleware` is commented out, suggesting a refactoring or temporary deactivation of that specific upload mechanism, potentially replaced by `upload_save_edit`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM):**
    *   This utility file has received extensive new functionalities to support the enhanced analytics controller.
    *   `defaultDateRange` now calculates a date range of one year prior to the current date.
    *   `replaceValueInQuery` was refined for more robust column name handling.
    *   `getUserObject` was improved to handle company-specific user codes, especially for 'ADMIN' access, by querying the `mtr_user_master` table.
    *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` is a new function for generating dynamic `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `date_trunc`, and `SELECT` clauses based on time periods (month, week, quarter) for aggregation.
    *   `getExcelSelectedColumns` is a new function that dynamically selects columns for Excel exports based on the report name (e.g., "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "BL Release KPI") and a booking flag, including a network days calculation.
    *   New utility functions `isValidDate` and `dateFilterOnExport` were added to validate and format date fields within datasets before export, ensuring data integrity and presentation.
    *   A comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` constant array was introduced, detailing the key and display name for a wide array of shipment and container-related fields for exports.
    *   The `moment` library is now utilized for flexible date formatting.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics Expansion and Modularity:** There's a clear pattern of expanding analytics capabilities across the system, with a modular design using specialized query builders and utility functions for various report types and data processing tasks.
*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** Several new functions (e.g., `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`, `getExcelSelectedColumns`) are designed to dynamically construct parts of database queries or select columns based on user input or report type.
*   **Robust Date Handling:** A strong emphasis on date management is evident, including default date ranges, date validation (`isValidDate`), date formatting for exports (`dateFilterOnExport` using `moment`), and date-based aggregations (`getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`).
*   **Enhanced Export Functionality:** The addition of `getExcelSelectedColumns`, `dateFilterOnExport`, and `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` indicates a significant investment in improving the accuracy, completeness, and formatting of data exported to Excel.
*   **User Context and Access Control:** The `getUserObject` logic suggests a system that dynamically adjusts data access or query parameters based on user roles (e.g., 'ADMIN') and associated companies.
*   **OTM Integration:** The updates to the OTM BOL routes point to an ongoing effort to enhance integration with Oracle Transportation Management, including data exchange (XML generation) and process management (sending to OTM).

The provided log details a series of iterative changes primarily focused on frontend UI components and analytics dashboard functionality.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`**: This file underwent extensive and frequent modifications, particularly between **11/3/2025, 2:50:09 PM** and **11/3/2025, 3:28:26 PM**, and then again with console logs around **6:03:52 PM - 6:04:54 PM**.
    *   Early changes involved minor adjustments to Tailwind CSS classes for spacing (`gap-2` to `gap-3`), button rounding (`rounded-full` to `rounded-lg`), text colors, and hover effects.
    *   A significant update around **11/3/2025, 2:54:13 PM** introduced fixed width (`w-[180px]`), height (`h-[40px]`), and shadow styling (`shadow-[0_4px_6px...]`) for the optional "New" button chip. This styling was temporarily applied to, then reverted from, the regular option buttons.
    *   Around **11/3/2025, 2:57:06 PM**, the rendering order of the "New" button and the option buttons was swapped.
    *   A major stylistic overhaul at **11/3/2025, 3:09:50 PM** standardized button appearance, introducing `icon` as a property for both regular options and the "New" button, changing rounding to `rounded-xl` (later to `rounded-md`), and simplifying shadow classes. Scroll button styling and icon sizes (`ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight`) were also adjusted multiple times (e.g., `fontSize="small"` to `medium` to `large`).
    *   The `max-w` property of the main container `div` was frequently modified, expanding from `520px` to `1200px` and then settling around `1150px` by **11/3/2025, 3:28:26 PM**, often accompanied by `ml-[-6px]` adjustments for precise positioning.
    *   Console log statements for `options` and `value` were added and refined in the later timestamps.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**: The initial entry at **11/3/2025, 2:56:23 PM** marks a substantial update, introducing numerous imports for UI components, state management, and PDF generation libraries.
    *   A `downloadDashboardPDF` function was implemented using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` to export the analytics dashboard to PDF, including a logo. This functionality persisted throughout subsequent commits, with earlier commented-out versions visible.
    *   The component heavily relies on Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) to manage dashboard state, filters, and operation types.
    *   It integrates the `ChipsTabView` component, providing options for dashboard views and a "New" button.
    *   Minor import changes for icons from `@heroicons/react` and `react-icons/hi2` occurred intermittently (e.g., `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, `PlusIcon` removed, `PresentationChartLineIcon` changed size, `HiPresentationChartLine` added) between **11/3/2025, 3:05:04 PM** and **11/3/2025, 3:23:44 PM**.
    *   Many commits for this file show no functional code changes, suggesting frequent saves during development.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**: The change at **11/3/2025, 4:52:06 PM** introduces the core analytics grid container.
    *   This component uses `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to reorder and resize (`moveItem`, `saveSize`) metrics on the dashboard.
    *   It fetches and dispatches report data, integrating with a Redux slice and API mutation hooks (`useLazyFetchReportQuery`, `useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`).
    *   It renders `ResizableGridItem` components, each encapsulating a `MetricsBox`.
    *   No significant changes were observed in the subsequent timestamp for this file.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`**: At **11/3/2025, 5:16:09 PM**, this component was updated to provide actions for individual metric cards.
    *   It includes functionalities to enlarge metrics, export data to Excel (`handleExcel` using `downloadReportSpreadsheet`), and export individual metric charts to PDF (`handlePdf` utilizing `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro`).
    *   It also features column selection for Excel export via a modal (`ColumnsSelector`) and displays calculated values or formulas.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx`**: This chart component was introduced at **11/3/2025, 5:58:14 PM**.
    *   It uses `react-apexcharts` to render a radial bar chart (gauge) visualizing "Average Days".
    *   The fill color of the gauge is dynamically determined based on a `value < 3` condition.
    *   Subsequent minor adjustments were made to the gradient colors and shades of the chart's fill property between **11/3/2025, 5:58:58 PM** and **11/3/2025, 5:59:43 PM**.

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**: This component, introduced at **11/3/2025, 6:05:49 PM**, enables users to manage custom dashboard views.
    *   It supports adding, editing, and deleting views, categorized as "Container Wise" or "MBL Wise" via a `RadioNav`.
    *   Metrics can be selected through a `TreeViewContainer`, with a limit of 9 metrics per view.
    *   It interacts with the analytics API (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`) and Redux for persistence and state updates.
    *   Audit functionality for view changes is included through an `AuditViewDrawer`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
