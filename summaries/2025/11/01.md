# Activity Summary for 11/1/2025

## 11:12:11 AM
The provided log details a series of frequent code changes across several frontend components, primarily within the analytics section of a T360-V2 application, all occurring on **October 31, 2025, between 8:17 PM and 10:09 PM**. A strong recurring pattern is a shift from Material-UI components to a combination of custom Catalyst UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling and functionality. Another consistent element across relevant files is the use of Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for state management and the `jsPDF`/`html2canvas` libraries for PDF generation. Extensive `console.log` statements suggest active debugging.

Here's a breakdown of changes by file:

*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**: This file underwent numerous minor updates throughout the period. Its core functionality revolves around a toolbar for analytics dashboards, including global filters, dashboard selection, and PDF export. The `downloadDashboardPDF` function, which captures dashboard content and exports it with a logo, was iteratively refined (as seen by commented-out older versions). New icons (`MdOpenInFull`, `RiDragMove2Fill`) were introduced, though their usage in the visible JSX is not immediately apparent, suggesting potential future features or isolated testing.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx`**: This component handles filters specific to individual metrics. Changes focused on updating the icons used for chart type selection within a `RadioNav` component. The `BarChart` icon from Material-UI was replaced by `IoBarChartSharp` (react-icons/io5), and `FaChartLine` was replaced by `MdTimeline` (react-icons/md). There was a brief, temporary change where `MdAttachMoney` was used for the 'bar' chart icon.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`**: This file manages actions at the footer of metric displays, such as exporting to Excel or PDF, and enlarging charts. A notable change was the refactoring of its layout from Material-UI `Stack` components to `div` elements with Tailwind CSS classes, alongside adding more specific styling to `IconButton` components. Icon imports for PDF and Excel (`MdPictureAsPdf`, `FaFileExcel`) were made more robust. A temporary issue where `CircularProgress` was incorrectly replaced with an unimported `Load` component (then `Loader`) was quickly rectified.
*   **`src\components\common\theme-model.tsx`**: This file defines reusable modal components. Initially, these modals used custom `div` structures with Tailwind CSS. A significant change involved refactoring both `ThemedModal` and `ThemedModalExtend` to utilize Material-UI's `Modal` component and `Box` for layout and styling, defining separate style objects (`styles`, `styles1`). Minor cosmetic adjustments to shadow classes and default width properties also occurred.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\ColumnsSelector.tsx`**: This component, used for selecting columns to export, saw substantial refactoring. It transitioned from primarily using Material-UI components like `TextField`, `Checkbox`, and `Switch` to a blend of custom Catalyst UI components (`InputBox`, `Switch`, `Checkbox`, `Button`, `Label`) and Tailwind CSS. The MUI `Switch` and `Checkbox` components also received inline `sx` styling overrides to enforce a black color theme.
*   **`src\components\common\app-drawer.tsx`**: Similar to the modal components, `AppDrawer` was refactored. It moved from being an MUI `Drawer` component to a custom implementation using `div` elements and Tailwind CSS for its structure, animations, and styling. Icons were switched from MUI to `react-icons/io5`. A `useEffect` hook was added to manage `document.body.style.overflow` to prevent scrolling when the drawer is open, and various width properties were experimented with.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**: This component for managing custom analytic dashboards also saw UI changes. Its tab navigation system was temporarily switched from `ThemeTabs` to `RadioNav`, and then reverted back to `ThemeTabs` within the log's timeframe. The import path for `ANALYTICS_VIEW_AUDIT_COLUMNS` was updated. The `TreeViewContianer` was briefly commented out and then uncommented, indicating active development of its nested metric selection.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.tsx`**: This component, which displays hierarchical metric options, received a minor cleanup by removing an unused `cn` utility import.
