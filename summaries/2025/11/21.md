# Activity Summary for 11/21/2025

## 10:54:32 AM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\company_details.controller.ts` was updated twice in quick succession on 11/21/2025.

**Key Changes:**
*   Between 10:07:54 AM and 10:08:08 AM, two `console.log` statements were removed from the `getAll` function.
*   These removed statements were located within the `CUSTOMER` role logic, specifically when pagination (`isPagination`) is enabled:
    *   `console.log("====totalResult",totalResult)`
    *   `console.log("====result",result)`
*   A third `console.log("====total",total)` statement in the same block remains present in both versions.

**File-specific Updates:**
The updates pertain solely to the `company_details.controller.ts` file, indicating a minor code refinement, likely a removal of debugging statements after testing the pagination logic for 'CUSTOMER' role.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The changes occurred very close together: 11/21/2025, 10:07:54 AM and 11/21/2025, 10:08:08 AM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The primary pattern observed is the removal of debugging `console.log` statements, suggesting a quick cleanup after verifying functionality. The core business logic for fetching company names based on `AGENT` (from `agent_po_account_master` table) or `CUSTOMER` (from `mtr_tracking_data` table with pagination support) remains consistent across both timestamps. Both roles filter by a search query and map results to `{ value, label }` format.
