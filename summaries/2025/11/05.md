# Activity Summary for 11/5/2025

## 9:40:09 AM
The `src\routes\index.ts` file, updated at 11/4/2025, 7:35:07 PM, underwent significant expansion to consolidate and register a wide array of API routes for the backend. New routes were added for authentication, customer management, line bookings, customer bookings, document uploads, vessel management, vendor management, and job management. Additionally, dedicated endpoints for autocomplete search (`/autocomplete`) and audit logs (`/audit`) were integrated, utilizing `getAll` from `searchOptions` and `getAllAudit` from `auditService` respectively. A previously existing `EnquiryRoutes` section was commented out.

Following shortly after, at 11/4/2025, 7:43:53 PM, the `src\middleware\uploadMiddleware.ts` file was introduced or updated to implement a robust and flexible file upload mechanism. This file exports an `uploadMiddleware` factory function that leverages `multer` for disk storage. Key features include:
*   **Dynamic folder creation:** The middleware can create highly specific destination folders, optionally including `year/month/day/hour-minute-second` within a `mainFolder/subFolder` structure, ensuring unique and organized storage paths.
*   **Directory Management:** It automatically creates the necessary directories recursively if they don't exist.
*   **Unique Filenaming:** Files are renamed upon upload to include a timestamp-based unique suffix, preventing name collisions while retaining the original base name and extension.
*   **File Filtering and Limits:** It accepts all file types by default (though customizable) and enforces a 10MB file size limit.
*   **Versatile Handlers:** The factory function returns an object containing various `multer` handlers (`single`, `array`, `fields`, `any`) to support different file upload scenarios, making it highly adaptable for handling single files, multiple files, or files associated with specific form fields.

The changes indicate a focused development effort within a short timeframe on 11/4/2025, primarily enhancing the backend's routing capabilities to support core business logic and introducing a sophisticated file upload system, suggesting that document management is a critical component of the application.
