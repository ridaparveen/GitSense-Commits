# Activity Summary for 11/18/2025

## 9:32:08 AM
The changes primarily focus on two files: `modules\anchor\jsonAnchor.js` and `scripts\run.AnchorJsonData.js`, with one log entry for a JSON sample file. All modifications occurred on 11/17/2025, indicating a concentrated development effort.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\modules\anchor\jsonAnchor.js`

This file, which defines an `AnchorJsonData` class responsible for fetching data from a database, underwent continuous and significant evolution throughout the day.

*   **Initial Query (2:21 PM):** The `fetchData` method began with a basic SQL query joining `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_cargolist`, and `agent_booking_container`. It selected fields like `agent_booking_id`, `pol_code`, `pod_code`, `pono`, `pieces`, and `total_cbm`.
*   **Major Query Refactor (2:49 PM - 4:12 PM):** The SQL query was substantially revamped. The `agent_booking_cargolist` table was removed, and `mtr_tracking_data` was introduced and joined with `agent_booking_entry`. The `SELECT` clause was expanded to include a wide array of new fields from `agent_booking_entry` (e.g., `bookingno`, `isf_status`, `mblno`, `blno`) and `mtr_tracking_data` (e.g., `shipment_completed`, `scac_code`, various dates like `rail_ata`, `delivery_customer_date`, `pol`, `pod`, terminal information, `customs_release_date`, `po_no`, `account_name`). Many columns were aliased for clarity in the output (e.g., `departure_date as etd`).
*   **Adding Filtering Conditions (4:15 PM):** Filtering conditions were introduced to the `WHERE` clause: `m.shipment_completed = 'Yes'` and `m.account_name = 'ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO.'`. There was a brief period of toggling the `shipment_completed` condition between `'No'`, `'Yes'`, and `='Yes'` (4:15 PM - 4:18 PM), suggesting active testing or debugging of this filter.
*   **`DISTINCT` Keyword Toggling (4:24 PM):** The `DISTINCT` keyword was briefly removed and then re-added to the `SELECT` statement.
*   **Join Type and Primary Table Changes (4:33 PM - 4:35 PM):** The SQL query's structure around `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses saw changes, experimenting with `mtr_tracking_data` as the primary table with `LEFT JOIN`s, then reverting, and finally settling on `mtr_tracking_data m LEFT JOIN agent_booking_entry e`.
*   **Introducing `t49_tracking_details` and Iterative Processing (4:57 PM - 5:14 PM):**
    *   A new SQL query (`select * from t49_tracking_details`) was added and used to fetch data, initially overshadowing the main `getQuery`.
    *   The fetched data (`rows:data`) began to be processed in a loop, attempting to construct a `containerDetails` array with "Empty Out" events. A potential bug was introduced where `return result;` was inside the loop, causing the function to exit after the first iteration. This loop and `result` variable were later removed.
    *   The `t49_tracking_details` table was then explicitly `LEFT JOIN`ed with `mtr_tracking_data` in `sqlQuery`.
*   **Major Output Restructuring and Unified Query (5:18 PM):** The `fetchData` method underwent a significant refactor:
    *   A single, comprehensive SQL query (`sql`) was established, joining `mtr_tracking_data`, `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_container`, and `t49_tracking_details`. It included selecting various container milestone timestamps (e.g., `empty_out_at`, `loaded_return AS full_in`, `vessel_loaded`, `vessel_departed`, `vessel_arrived`, `full_out`, `empty_in`).
    *   The raw query results (`rows`) were then transformed into a structured `shipmentMap` object, grouping related containers and their milestones under each `bookingno`. This correctly returned the aggregated data outside the loop.
*   **Refinement of Joins and Milestones (5:19 PM - 6:56 PM):**
    *   The `agent_booking_container` join was removed, and `m.contno` was used directly for `container_number`.
    *   Specific milestone fields in the `SELECT` query were adjusted, and `m.t49_contno_out_gated` was added to the selection.
    *   The mapping of milestone events to database columns in the output structure was refined, using `r.atd` for "Vessel Departed" and `r.ata` for "Vessel Arrived", and `r.t49_contno_out_gated` for "Full Out". The "Empty In" milestone was initially removed from the `SELECT` list, then still pushed in the output structure (implicitly `undefined`), then eventually explicitly removed from the output structure.
    *   `COALESCE` functions were introduced for `atd` and `ata` to provide fallback values from `m.vessel_actualdeparted_date` and `m.vessel_actualarrived_date` respectively. `eta` was specifically mapped to `m.t49_eta`.
    *   A unique grouping key `r.bookingno || r.mblno` was introduced for the `shipmentMap` to handle potential null `bookingno` values, with a minor bug introduced and quickly corrected regarding `shipmentMap[r.key]`.
*   **Logging:** Numerous `console.log` statements were added, removed, or commented out for debugging the SQL queries and their results.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\scripts\run.AnchorJsonData.js`

This script is responsible for executing the `AnchorJsonData` batch.

*   **Batch Execution Setup (2:23 PM):** It was established to load environment variables, create a logger, and use `moment` for timestamping. It initialized the `AnchorJsonData` class, called its `fetchData` method, and logged batch start/end and total execution time.
*   **Output Logging Changes (5:21 PM - 6:56 PM):** The script frequently changed how the `fetchData` result (`res`) was logged to the console. This included toggling between `console.log(res, "res==data")`, `logger.info(json data, JSON.stringify(res))`, and pretty-printing the JSON output using `JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)` or `JSON.stringify(res, 2)`, often commenting out one form of output logging in favor of another.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\Downloads\Anchor_Ingedients_Shipmnet_Payload (1).json`

*   **Sample Payload (6:33 PM):** This file contains a sample JSON structure representing two shipment records. Each record includes comprehensive details about the shipment (booking, MBL, dates, locations, customs, PO numbers) and nested container objects, each with its own list of milestones (event and timestamp). This JSON structure appears to be the target output format the `jsonAnchor.js` module was being developed to produce.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** The rapid sequence of changes, especially within `jsonAnchor.js`, and the frequent addition/removal of `console.log` statements, demonstrate an iterative development and debugging process aimed at refining the data fetching and transformation logic.
*   **SQL Query Complexity:** The SQL query in `jsonAnchor.js` progressively became more complex, incorporating more tables, columns, aliases, and `COALESCE` functions to handle data retrieval.
*   **Structured JSON Output:** A consistent goal was to produce a highly structured JSON output, grouping container milestones under their respective shipments, as evidenced by the `shipmentMap` logic and the provided sample JSON payload.
*   **Date/Time Handling:** The reliance on `moment.js` in the `run.AnchorJsonData.js` script and the extensive selection of date/timestamp fields in `jsonAnchor.js` highlight the importance of time-related data in the application.
*   **Specific Business Logic:** The filters `m.shipment_completed = 'Yes'` and `m.account_name = 'ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO.'` indicate that this batch processing is tailored for specific "ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO." shipments that are marked as "completed".

## 10:32:08 AM
The changes primarily revolve around a Node.js batch application designed to extract and transform shipment tracking data for "ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO." into a structured JSON format.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\modules\anchor\jsonAnchor.js`**: This file contains the core logic for fetching and processing data.
    *   **Initial Data Fetching (11/17/2025, 2:21 PM - 2:49 PM)**: The module `jsonAnchor.js` started with a `fetchData` method querying `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_cargolist`, and `agent_booking_container` to retrieve basic booking and cargo details like `agent_booking_id`, `pol_code`, `pod_code`, `pono`, `pieces`, and `total_cbm`.
    *   **Shift to Shipment Tracking Data (11/17/2025, 2:49 PM)**: A significant overhaul of the SQL query occurred, replacing cargo-related tables with `mtr_tracking_data` and focusing on comprehensive shipment tracking details (e.g., `mblno`, `blno`, `scac_code`, various ETD/ETA/ATA dates, terminal info, customs release, `po_no`).
    *   **Introduction of Filtering (11/17/2025, 4:15 PM - 4:18 PM)**: The `fetchData` method was enhanced to include `WHERE` clauses to filter shipments. This involved repeated changes between `m.shipment_completed = 'Yes'` and `m.shipment_completed <> 'Yes'`, eventually settling on `m.shipment_completed = 'Yes'` and `m.account_name = 'ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO.'`, indicating a focus on completed shipments for a specific client.
    *   **Query Structure Refinement (11/17/2025, 4:33 PM - 4:35 PM)**: There were several adjustments to the SQL query's `FROM` clause and join types, alternating between starting the query from `agent_booking_entry` or `mtr_tracking_data` and consistently using `LEFT JOIN`.
    *   **Attempt at Milestone Processing (11/17/2025, 4:57 PM - 5:14 PM)**: An attempt was made to introduce a separate `sqlQuery` for `t49_tracking_details` and loop through its results. This initial implementation had logical flaws, such as re-initializing the result array within the loop.
    *   **Major Data Transformation Logic (11/17/2025, 5:18 PM)**: A substantial change consolidated the data fetching into a single complex SQL query. This query joined `mtr_tracking_data`, `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_container`, and `t49_tracking_details` to select a wide array of shipment and container milestone data. Post-query processing was introduced to transform the flat database rows into a hierarchical JSON object, grouping containers and their milestones under each shipment.
    *   **Refinement of Container Joins and Milestones (11/17/2025, 5:19 PM - 6:56 PM)**: Further adjustments refined how container numbers were joined (`m.contno AS container_number` instead of `con.contno`) and which specific milestone fields (`t.empty_out_at`, `t.loaded_return AS full_in`, `t.vessel_loaded`, `m.t49_contno_out_gated`) were selected. Missing milestone timestamps in the output structure were corrected by either mapping to existing fields or removing events that were not retrieved. The SQL query was updated to use `COALESCE` for some date fields (e.g., `atd`, `ata`) to ensure data availability from multiple potential sources. A bug where containers were incorrectly assigned to shipments (`shipmentMap[r.key]`) was introduced and subsequently fixed. The "Empty In" milestone was ultimately removed from the output structure, aligning it with the SQL query.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\scripts\run.AnchorJsonData.js`**: This file is a batch script responsible for executing the `jsonAnchor` module.
    *   **Basic Batch Execution (11/17/2025, 2:23 PM)**: Initial setup included loading environment variables, creating a logger, marking batch start/end times, calling `anchorJsonData.fetchData()`, and logging the raw result.
    *   **Logging Refinements (11/17/2025, 5:21 PM - 6:56 PM)**: Repeated modifications were made to how the fetched data was logged. This involved toggling between `console.log(res)`, `logger.info(JSON.stringify(res))`, and pretty-printing JSON output (`JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)` or `JSON.stringify(res, 2)`), indicating active debugging and presentation considerations for the output.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\Downloads\Anchor_Ingedients_Shipmnet_Payload (1).json`**: This JSON file (timestamp 11/17/2025, 6:33 PM) serves as an example of the structured output that the `jsonAnchor.js` module is designed to produce. It contains an array of shipment objects, each with detailed tracking information and a nested array of containers, each listing specific milestones with timestamps (e.g., Empty Out, Full In, Vessel Loaded). This demonstrates the desired hierarchical data format.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: There's a clear pattern of incremental changes, particularly in `jsonAnchor.js`, where the SQL query and data transformation logic are progressively refined. Frequent commits modifying SQL joins, selected columns, and `WHERE` clauses, along with the insertion and removal of `console.log` statements in both files, highlight an active development and debugging process.
*   **Focus on Shipment Tracking**: The core purpose of the changes is to retrieve and structure detailed shipment and container tracking information, specifically for the "ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO." account.
*   **Data Transformation from Flat to Hierarchical**: A key recurring theme is the effort to transform flat database query results into a more complex, nested JSON structure suitable for programmatic use or display, grouping container milestones under their respective shipments.
*   **Timestamp-Based Milestone Tracking**: The `milestione` array within containers, containing `event` and `timestamp` pairs, is a consistent element in the desired output structure, indicating a focus on tracking event chronology.
*   **Database Interaction**: Both `jsonAnchor.js` and `run.AnchorJsonData.js` consistently interact with a PostgreSQL database via a `pool` object, indicating a data-driven application.
*   **Error Handling**: The `fetchData` method in `jsonAnchor.js` consistently includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential database errors.

## 11:32:07 AM
The development log details a focused session on November 17, 2025, predominantly affecting two files within a `cng-batches` project related to `anchor` data processing. The core task appears to be extracting and structuring shipment tracking information from a database into a specific JSON format.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\modules\anchor\jsonAnchor.js`**
    *   **Initial Query (2:21 PM)**: Started with a basic `fetchData` function querying `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_cargolist`, and `agent_booking_container` for booking details, cargo pieces, and CBM.
    *   **Query Refinement (2:49 PM - 4:12 PM)**: The SQL query was significantly revamped to join `mtr_tracking_data` instead of `agent_booking_cargolist`, shifting focus to tracking data (MBL, BL, status, various dates like rail ATA, delivery, LFD, POL, POD, terminal info, customs, PO numbers, FDA release). Columns were aliased for clarity (e.g., `etd`, `eta`, `atd`).
    *   **Filtering Logic (4:15 PM - 4:18 PM)**: `whereClauses` were introduced to filter data based on `m.shipment_completed` and `m.account_name = 'ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO.'`. The `shipment_completed` condition was actively tested and toggled between `'No'`, `'Yes'`, and `<> 'Yes'` before settling on `m.shipment_completed = 'Yes'`.
    *   **Join Types and Order Changes (4:33 PM - 4:35 PM)**: There were several rapid changes in the `FROM` clause and `JOIN` types (from `JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN`) and the order of tables, indicating experimentation with how the tables should be related (`mtr_tracking_data` or `agent_booking_entry` as primary).
    *   **Temporary Query Change (4:57 PM)**: A brief diversion occurred where the `fetchData` function temporarily switched to an independent `SELECT * FROM t49_tracking_details` query, discarding the main complex query.
    *   **Comprehensive Query and Data Transformation (5:12 PM - 5:18 PM)**: A major refactor combined the various data sources into a single, complex `LEFT JOIN` SQL query. This new query (`sql`) targeted `mtr_tracking_data`, `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_container`, and `t49_tracking_details` to select a broad range of shipment details and container-specific milestones. Post-query processing was introduced to map flat results into a hierarchical JSON structure, grouping by `bookingno` and nesting `containers` with `milestone` events.
    *   **Container and Milestone Refinement (5:19 PM - 6:56 PM)**:
        *   The `agent_booking_container` join was removed, and `container_number` was sourced from `m.contno`.
        *   Milestone events were meticulously mapped to specific database columns (e.g., `Vessel Departed` to `r.atd`, `Full Out` to `r.t49_contno_out_gated`).
        *   The `SELECT` clause for `atd` and `ata` was enhanced with `COALESCE` to handle potentially missing data by falling back to alternative date columns (`m.vessel_actualdeparted_date`, `m.vessel_actualarrived_date`).
        *   A unique grouping `key` (`r.bookingno || r.mblno`) was introduced for robustness, and a bug in its application for container pushing was swiftly corrected.
        *   The `Empty In` milestone was removed from the output structure.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\scripts\run.AnchorJsonData.js`**
    *   **Batch Script Initialization (2:23 PM)**: A script was set up to run the `fetchData` function from `jsonAnchor.js`, including logger setup and batch timing.
    *   **Console Logging for Debugging (5:21 PM - 6:56 PM)**: There were frequent adjustments to how the `fetchData` result was logged to the console, oscillating between simple `console.log(res)`, `JSON.stringify(res)`, and `JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)` (pretty-printed JSON) to aid in debugging and reviewing the structured output.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\Downloads\Anchor_Ingedients_Shipmnet_Payload (1).json`**
    *   **Example Output (6:33 PM)**: This file represents the desired final JSON output structure, containing an array of shipment objects, each with detailed booking, tracking, and nested container-specific milestone data. It serves as a reference for the `jsonAnchor.js` output transformation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative SQL Development**: The `jsonAnchor.js` file shows a clear pattern of continuous refinement of a single, complex SQL query over many commits, indicating an effort to precisely select and join multiple database tables.
*   **Data Restructuring Focus**: A dominant theme is the transformation of relational database query results into a structured, hierarchical JSON format, grouping shipments and nesting container-specific milestones. This pattern is implemented and refined in the Node.js code after the database query.
*   **Debugging-Driven Changes**: Frequent additions, modifications, and removals of `console.log` statements across both `.js` files highlight an active debugging process to inspect both the raw query results and the transformed JSON output.
*   **Consistent Project/Client Context**: The presence of "ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO." in the SQL `WHERE` clauses and "Anchor_Ingedients_Shipmnet_Payload" in the JSON filename indicates a specific client or project for which this data processing is being developed.
*   **Logger Integration**: The `run.AnchorJsonData.js` script consistently uses a custom logger (`createLogger`) for batch status and timing, which is a common practice in batch processing applications.
*   **Single-Day Development**: All changes occurred on the same day (November 17, 2025), suggesting a concentrated development effort.

## 3:44:52 PM
The log details changes across three primary files: `jsonAnchor.js`, `run.AnchorJsonData.js`, and one JSON file. The timeline of these changes spans November 17-18, 2025, showing a progressive development and refinement of a data fetching and SFTP upload process.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\modules\anchor\jsonAnchor.js`**:
    *   **Initial Development (11/17/2025, 2:21 PM - 4:12 PM):** The file starts with a basic `fetchData` method, querying `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_cargolist`, and `agent_booking_container`. The `SELECT` clause initially fetches booking, POL/POD codes, PO number, pieces, package type, and CBM. Over several commits, the `SELECT` statement undergoes significant expansion.
    *   **Query Expansion and Refinement (11/17/2025, 2:49 PM - 4:12 PM):** The SQL query is drastically changed to join `mtr_tracking_data` and select a much broader set of fields related to shipment tracking, master bill of lading (MBL) details, SCAC code, various dates (ETD, ETA, ATD, ATA, rail dates, delivery dates, LFD, demurrage), terminal information, customs and freight release dates, ISF status, PO numbers, and customer details. The join conditions are also updated to primarily use `m.mblno = e.mblno`.
    *   **Adding Filtering Conditions (11/17/2025, 4:15 PM - 4:18 PM):** `WHERE` clauses are introduced to filter data where `m.shipment_completed` is either not 'No' (later changed to not 'Yes', then 'Yes') and `m.account_name` is 'ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO.'. There's an oscillation in the `shipment_completed` condition between `'Yes'` and `NOT 'Yes'`.
    *   **Refining Query and Joins (11/17/2025, 4:24 PM - 4:35 PM):** The `DISTINCT` keyword is temporarily removed from the `SELECT` clause (4:24 PM) and then re-added (4:24 PM). The `JOIN` types for `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry` are changed from `JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN` (4:33 PM, 4:35 PM), and the primary table in the `FROM` clause is switched between `agent_booking_entry` and `mtr_tracking_data`.
    *   **Milestone Integration Attempt (11/17/2025, 4:57 PM - 5:14 PM):** There's an attempt to fetch data from `t49_tracking_details` via a separate `sqlQuery` and then iterate over it to extract container milestone details, such as "Empty Out" timestamps. This initial attempt seems incomplete and potentially buggy (e.g., `for(rows of data)` followed by `const result = []`). It leads to confusion by having two distinct queries.
    *   **Consolidated Query and Data Structuring (11/17/2025, 5:18 PM - 5:19 PM):** The `fetchData` method is significantly refactored. A single, complex SQL query is introduced using `LEFT JOIN` with `t49_tracking_details` to directly pull container milestones (`empty_out_at`, `loaded_return` as `full_in`, `vessel_loaded`, etc.). The JavaScript code then processes the flat SQL result into a hierarchical JSON structure, grouping shipments by `booking_no` and nesting container details with their milestones. The `agent_booking_container` join is removed, and `m.contno` is used for container number and joining with `t49_tracking_details`.
    *   **Query Refinement and Milestone Mapping (11/17/2025, 5:19 PM - 6:56 PM):** The `SELECT` statement for milestones is slightly adjusted (e.g., `vessel_departed`, `vessel_arrived`, `full_out`, `empty_in` are removed from the direct select and then added back using derived values or existing columns like `m.atd` and `m.ata` for vessel departure/arrival). A `t49_contno_out_gated` field is added to the SQL query to represent the "Full Out" milestone. The `eta` and `atd` fields in the `SELECT` statement are updated to use `COALESCE` with `t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date`/`vessel_actualdeparted_date` and `t49_vessel_actualarrived_date`/`vessel_actualarrived_date` respectively, and `m.t49_eta` for `eta`. The logic for grouping containers ensures unique shipments are formed (`shipmentMap[key]`) and containers are pushed to the correct shipment. A bug is fixed where `shipmentMap[r.key]` was used instead of `shipmentMap[key]` when adding containers.
    *   **SFTP Integration and File Generation (11/18/2025, 1:43 PM - 2:02 PM):** The `AnchorJsonData` class is extended with new responsibilities.
        *   It now includes a `moveAnchorJsonFileToSftp` method which orchestrates the entire process: fetching data (`fetchAnchorJsonData`), connecting to an SFTP server, generating JSON files locally in a `temp/anchor-json` directory, uploading these files to a remote `/anchor/` directory on the SFTP server, and then cleaning up the local temporary files.
        *   New dependencies `fs`, `path`, `config`, `Client` (from `ssh2-sftp-client`), `moveFiles`, and `gmail` are imported.
        *   Error handling for SFTP operations is added, including sending email notifications via `gmailSender.utils`.
        *   The `connect` method is extracted to handle SFTP connection logic, explicitly logging the SFTP configuration and potential connection failures. It also switches `config.sftpConfig` to `config.sftpConfig7501` at 2:02 PM, indicating a change in the target SFTP configuration.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\scripts\run.AnchorJsonData.js`**:
    *   **Batch Execution Script (11/17/2025, 2:23 PM):** This script is responsible for running the data fetching batch. It initializes a logger, records start/end times, calls `anchorJsonData.fetchData()`, and logs the results.
    *   **Logging and Output Changes (11/17/2025, 5:21 PM - 5:23 PM):** The script's output logging is modified, initially adding `logger.info('json data',JSON.stringify(res))` (5:21 PM), then removing it (5:21 PM), and finally refining how `res` is logged to the console using `JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)` or `JSON.stringify(res, 2)` for pretty-printing.
    *   **Invoking SFTP Upload (11/18/2025, 1:53 PM):** The script's core execution is changed from calling `anchorJsonData.fetchData()` to `anchorJsonData.moveAnchorJsonFileToSftp()`, reflecting the new functionality of the `jsonAnchor.js` module. The `console.log(res)` statements might become less relevant since `moveAnchorJsonFileToSftp` doesn't directly return the processed data but handles the file operations internally.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\Downloads\Anchor_Ingedients_Shipmnet_Payload (1).json`**:
    *   **Sample Data (11/17/2025, 6:33 PM):** This file appears to be a sample of the desired JSON output structure, containing two shipment records with detailed booking, MBL, tracking, and container milestone information. This likely served as a reference for the `jsonAnchor.js` module's data structuring logic.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/17/2025, 2:49 PM:** Major SQL query overhaul in `jsonAnchor.js` to fetch expanded tracking data.
*   **11/17/2025, 4:15 PM:** Introduction of specific `WHERE` clauses for `shipment_completed` and `account_name` in `jsonAnchor.js`.
*   **11/17/2025, 5:18 PM:** Major refactoring in `jsonAnchor.js` to consolidate SQL queries and transform flat results into a nested JSON structure with container milestones.
*   **11/18/2025, 1:43 PM:** `jsonAnchor.js` is transformed to include SFTP connection, local file generation, and upload logic, moving beyond just data fetching.
*   **11/18/2025, 1:53 PM:** `run.AnchorJsonData.js` is updated to call the new SFTP upload method.
*   **11/18/2025, 1:53 PM & 1:54 PM:** `gmailSender.utils` is integrated into `jsonAnchor.js` for error notifications, then commented out.
*   **11/18/2025, 2:02 PM:** Change in SFTP configuration object used for connection in `jsonAnchor.js` (`config.sftpConfig` to `config.sftpConfig7501`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Query Refinement:** The SQL query in `jsonAnchor.js` (within the `fetchData` or `fetchAnchorJsonData` method) is continually expanded and refined. This includes adding new `SELECT` fields, changing `JOIN` types, and adjusting `WHERE` clauses.
*   **Data Transformation:** There's a consistent pattern of fetching flat relational data from the database and then transforming it into a more structured, nested JSON object, especially for grouping containers and their milestones under a shipment.
*   **Logging:** The use of `logger.info` and `console.log` is prevalent across both JavaScript files for debugging and tracing execution flow.
*   **Error Handling:** `try...catch` blocks are consistently used in asynchronous functions to catch and propagate errors, often including logging the error message.
*   **SFTP Integration:** The latter part of the log shows a clear focus on integrating SFTP functionality, including connecting, uploading files, and handling related errors.
*   **Hardcoded Account Name:** The `m.account_name = 'ANCHOR INGREDIENTS CO.'` condition remains constant throughout the evolution of the SQL query, indicating a specific client or context for this batch process.
*   **Milestone Event Mapping:** The list of milestone events (Empty Out, Full In, Vessel Loaded, Vessel Departed, Vessel Arrived, Full Out, Empty In) and their corresponding timestamp fields from the database is a recurring structure in the data transformation logic.
*   **Temporary File Generation:** The pattern of generating temporary JSON files locally before uploading them via SFTP and then deleting them is established in the later stages.
