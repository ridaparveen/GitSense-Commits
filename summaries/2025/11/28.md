# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 4:30:48 AM
The recent changes focus on refining the HBL (House Bill of Lading) creation and update functionality within the `t360-backend` application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\hblEntry.controller.ts`**
    *   **11/26/2025, 12:21:43 PM - 12:30:44 PM:** The `createHblMasterBooking` function was primarily responsible for inserting a new HBL master record and its associated details (vessel, HBL-specific data, routing, containers, purchase orders) into various database tables (`hbl_master`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_hbl`, `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_po`). It leveraged database transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK) for data integrity. A `saveHblBooking` function existed but its update logic was incomplete, mainly fetching data.
    *   **11/26/2025, 2:32:34 PM:** Minor adjustments were made to the `bookingInsertQuery` within `createHblMasterBooking` to explicitly include `bookingdate` and `transport_mode` fields.
    *   **11/26/2025, 4:41:31 PM - 6:04:47 PM:** An attempt was made to merge create and update logic into `createHblMasterBooking` by checking for `serial_id` (initially from `req.query`, then `req.body`). This interim state introduced a conditional flow where, if `serial_id` was present, it would try to update `hbl_master` and `agent_booking_vessel`, but incorrectly attempted to *insert* into other detail tables or had incorrect update conditions for `agent_booking_hbl`. This logic was inconsistent and likely buggy, leading to the next set of changes.
    *   **11/27/2025, 10:12:30 AM - 10:42:33 AM:** The problematic merged logic in `createHblMasterBooking` was removed, reverting it to solely handle the creation of new HBL records. The `saveHblBooking` function was commented out entirely, indicating a decision to separate creation and update operations.
    *   **11/27/2025, 10:54:16 AM:** A significant improvement was made to `createHblMasterBooking`. After inserting into `hbl_master`, the returned `serial_id` (aliased as `hbl_master_id`) is now correctly captured and used to link all subsequent related insertions (vessel, HBL details, routing, containers, POs) to this newly created master record. `booking_serial_id` was also introduced in `hbl_master` insert, retrieved from `agent_booking_entry` to link HBL to a main booking.
    *   **11/27/2025, 11:05:47 AM:** A new, dedicated function `updateHblMasterBooking` was introduced. This function explicitly handles updating an existing HBL record identified by `serial_id` (from `req.body`). It performs direct `UPDATE` queries for `hbl_master`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_hbl`. For lists like `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, and `agent_booking_po`, it adopts a "delete all, then insert new" strategy to manage changes effectively.
    *   **11/27/2025, 11:24:27 AM - 3:11:54 PM:** Continued refinement, ensuring `hbl_master_id` is consistently passed and used for all associated sub-records during creation. The `hbldate` in `bookingInsertQuery` and `hblDeatailsCount` was made nullable.
    *   **11/27/2025, 3:24:58 PM - 3:30:57 PM:** A brief regression occurred where `hbldate` and `marks` were removed from `updateHblMasterBooking`'s update queries, but this was quickly rectified in the following commit, restoring the ability to update these fields.

2.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\hblEntry.route.ts`**
    *   **11/27/2025, 10:18:23 AM:** The route `router.post("/",saveHblBooking)` was commented out, aligning with the removal of the `saveHblBooking` function from the controller.
    *   **11/27/2025, 12:21:23 PM:** A new route `router.post("/update",updateHblMasterBooking)` was added, explicitly mapping to the newly introduced update controller function.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/26/2025, 4:41:31 PM:** Initial attempt to merge create/update logic in `createHblMasterBooking`.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:12:30 AM:** `createHblMasterBooking` reverts to create-only, `saveHblBooking` commented out.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:54:16 AM:** Correct `hbl_master_id` linking established in `createHblMasterBooking`.
*   **11/27/2025, 11:05:47 AM:** Introduction of `updateHblMasterBooking` for dedicated update logic.
*   **11/27/2025, 12:21:23 PM:** Corresponding `/update` route added for `updateHblMasterBooking`.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:30:57 PM:** Final correction to `updateHblMasterBooking` to correctly include `hbldate` and `marks` in update queries.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Data Sanitization:** All incoming string payload fields are consistently sanitized using `sanitizeString()`.
*   **Date Formatting:** Dates are formatted to `YYYY-MM-DD` using `AppDateFormate()` before database insertion/update, often allowing `null` values.
*   **Database Transactions:** All major write operations (`createHblMasterBooking`, `updateHblMasterBooking`) are wrapped in `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` for transactional integrity.
*   **Complex Data Structures:** HBLs are complex entities, reflected in the large `hblEntryPayloadTypes` object and the need to interact with multiple related database tables (master, vessel, HBL details, routing, containers, POs).
*   **List Management Strategy:** For child lists, the update strategy involves a complete replacement: `DELETE` all existing related records, then `INSERT MANY` the new list items from the request payload.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error checking is in place after each database operation (`if (!rowCount) throw new HttpError(...)`) to catch failures and trigger transaction rollbacks.
*   **API Refactoring:** There's a clear evolution from a potentially merged/confused create/update function (`saveHblBooking`) towards distinct, clearer API endpoints and controller functions (`createHblMasterBooking` and `updateHblMasterBooking`) for better maintainability and clarity.
