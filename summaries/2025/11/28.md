# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 4:30:48 AM
The recent changes focus on refining the HBL (House Bill of Lading) creation and update functionality within the `t360-backend` application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\hblEntry.controller.ts`**
    *   **11/26/2025, 12:21:43 PM - 12:30:44 PM:** The `createHblMasterBooking` function was primarily responsible for inserting a new HBL master record and its associated details (vessel, HBL-specific data, routing, containers, purchase orders) into various database tables (`hbl_master`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_hbl`, `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_po`). It leveraged database transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK) for data integrity. A `saveHblBooking` function existed but its update logic was incomplete, mainly fetching data.
    *   **11/26/2025, 2:32:34 PM:** Minor adjustments were made to the `bookingInsertQuery` within `createHblMasterBooking` to explicitly include `bookingdate` and `transport_mode` fields.
    *   **11/26/2025, 4:41:31 PM - 6:04:47 PM:** An attempt was made to merge create and update logic into `createHblMasterBooking` by checking for `serial_id` (initially from `req.query`, then `req.body`). This interim state introduced a conditional flow where, if `serial_id` was present, it would try to update `hbl_master` and `agent_booking_vessel`, but incorrectly attempted to *insert* into other detail tables or had incorrect update conditions for `agent_booking_hbl`. This logic was inconsistent and likely buggy, leading to the next set of changes.
    *   **11/27/2025, 10:12:30 AM - 10:42:33 AM:** The problematic merged logic in `createHblMasterBooking` was removed, reverting it to solely handle the creation of new HBL records. The `saveHblBooking` function was commented out entirely, indicating a decision to separate creation and update operations.
    *   **11/27/2025, 10:54:16 AM:** A significant improvement was made to `createHblMasterBooking`. After inserting into `hbl_master`, the returned `serial_id` (aliased as `hbl_master_id`) is now correctly captured and used to link all subsequent related insertions (vessel, HBL details, routing, containers, POs) to this newly created master record. `booking_serial_id` was also introduced in `hbl_master` insert, retrieved from `agent_booking_entry` to link HBL to a main booking.
    *   **11/27/2025, 11:05:47 AM:** A new, dedicated function `updateHblMasterBooking` was introduced. This function explicitly handles updating an existing HBL record identified by `serial_id` (from `req.body`). It performs direct `UPDATE` queries for `hbl_master`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_hbl`. For lists like `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, and `agent_booking_po`, it adopts a "delete all, then insert new" strategy to manage changes effectively.
    *   **11/27/2025, 11:24:27 AM - 3:11:54 PM:** Continued refinement, ensuring `hbl_master_id` is consistently passed and used for all associated sub-records during creation. The `hbldate` in `bookingInsertQuery` and `hblDeatailsCount` was made nullable.
    *   **11/27/2025, 3:24:58 PM - 3:30:57 PM:** A brief regression occurred where `hbldate` and `marks` were removed from `updateHblMasterBooking`'s update queries, but this was quickly rectified in the following commit, restoring the ability to update these fields.

2.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\hblEntry.route.ts`**
    *   **11/27/2025, 10:18:23 AM:** The route `router.post("/",saveHblBooking)` was commented out, aligning with the removal of the `saveHblBooking` function from the controller.
    *   **11/27/2025, 12:21:23 PM:** A new route `router.post("/update",updateHblMasterBooking)` was added, explicitly mapping to the newly introduced update controller function.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/26/2025, 4:41:31 PM:** Initial attempt to merge create/update logic in `createHblMasterBooking`.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:12:30 AM:** `createHblMasterBooking` reverts to create-only, `saveHblBooking` commented out.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:54:16 AM:** Correct `hbl_master_id` linking established in `createHblMasterBooking`.
*   **11/27/2025, 11:05:47 AM:** Introduction of `updateHblMasterBooking` for dedicated update logic.
*   **11/27/2025, 12:21:23 PM:** Corresponding `/update` route added for `updateHblMasterBooking`.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:30:57 PM:** Final correction to `updateHblMasterBooking` to correctly include `hbldate` and `marks` in update queries.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Data Sanitization:** All incoming string payload fields are consistently sanitized using `sanitizeString()`.
*   **Date Formatting:** Dates are formatted to `YYYY-MM-DD` using `AppDateFormate()` before database insertion/update, often allowing `null` values.
*   **Database Transactions:** All major write operations (`createHblMasterBooking`, `updateHblMasterBooking`) are wrapped in `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` for transactional integrity.
*   **Complex Data Structures:** HBLs are complex entities, reflected in the large `hblEntryPayloadTypes` object and the need to interact with multiple related database tables (master, vessel, HBL details, routing, containers, POs).
*   **List Management Strategy:** For child lists, the update strategy involves a complete replacement: `DELETE` all existing related records, then `INSERT MANY` the new list items from the request payload.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error checking is in place after each database operation (`if (!rowCount) throw new HttpError(...)`) to catch failures and trigger transaction rollbacks.
*   **API Refactoring:** There's a clear evolution from a potentially merged/confused create/update function (`saveHblBooking`) towards distinct, clearer API endpoints and controller functions (`createHblMasterBooking` and `updateHblMasterBooking`) for better maintainability and clarity.

## 5:30:45 AM
The changes primarily focus on the `hblEntry.controller.ts` file, responsible for managing House Bill of Lading (HBL) entries, and its corresponding route definitions in `hblEntry.route.ts`. The significant changes occurred across November 26-27, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\hblEntry.controller.ts`**
    *   **November 26, 2025 (12:21 PM - 12:30 PM)**: Initial implementation and minor internal tweaks to `createHblMasterBooking` and `saveHblBooking`. `createHblMasterBooking` was designed for inserting new HBL records across several database tables (e.g., `hbl_master`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_hbl`, `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_po`). `saveHblBooking` contained logic for fetching existing booking data, suggesting an update intent, though its implementation was incomplete or problematic.
    *   **November 26, 2025 (2:32 PM)**: The `bookingdate` field was uncommented and `transport_mode` was added to the `bookingInsertQuery` in `createHblMasterBooking`.
    *   **November 26, 2025 (4:41 PM - 6:04 PM)**: Multiple changes experimented with combining create and update logic within `createHblMasterBooking` by checking for a `serial_id` from either `req.query` or `req.body`. This resulted in confused logic where updates were attempted, but often followed by re-insertions into sub-tables, indicating an unstable implementation of the update flow.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (10:12 AM - 10:18 AM)**: The `if (serial_id)` and `else` blocks in `createHblMasterBooking` were removed, effectively reverting `createHblMasterBooking` to solely handle creation (insert operations). Crucially, the `saveHblBooking` function was entirely commented out, signifying a redesign of the update process.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (10:54 AM - 11:05 AM)**: `createHblMasterBooking` was refined to correctly retrieve the `serial_id` generated by the `hbl_master` insertion and use this `hbl_master_id` to link all related records (vessel, HBL details, routing, containers, POs), ensuring data integrity.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (11:24 AM)**: A query to find `booking_serial_id` from `agent_booking_entry` was added to `createHblMasterBooking`, and `hbl_master_id` linking was expanded to `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, and `agent_booking_po` during creation.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (12:19 PM)**: A new, dedicated `updateHblMasterBooking` function was introduced. This function takes `serial_id` from `req.body` to identify the HBL record. It performs direct `UPDATE` queries for `hbl_master`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_hbl`. For associated lists (routing, containers, POs), it implements a "delete and insert" pattern: existing records linked to the `hbl_master_id` are deleted, and new ones from the request payload are inserted.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (12:22 PM - 12:26 PM)**: Minor corrections were made to the `updateHblMasterBooking` SQL update statements, specifically re-adding and ensuring correct parameter mapping for fields like `hbldate` and `marks`.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (3:12 PM)**: Defaulting for `bookingdate` and `hbldate` in the payload construction and database inserts was improved to explicitly allow `null` values instead of `'null'` strings.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\hblEntry.route.ts`**
    *   **November 26, 2025 (2:49 PM)**: Initial routes were defined for `POST /` (for `saveHblBooking`), `GET /` (for `fetchHblFormDetails`), `GET /get-hbl`, and `POST /create` (for `createHblMasterBooking`).
    *   **November 27, 2025 (10:18 AM)**: The `router.post("/",saveHblBooking);` route was commented out, and `saveHblBooking` was removed from the imports.
    *   **November 27, 2025 (12:21 PM)**: `updateHblMasterBooking` was imported, and a new route `router.post("/update",updateHblMasterBooking);` was added.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Data Sanitization**: The `sanitizeString` utility is consistently applied to almost all string-based fields from the request body to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Date Formatting**: The `AppDateFormate` utility is uniformly used to convert date strings from the request body into a `YYYY-MM-DD` database format, with explicit handling for `null` values.
*   **Database Transactions**: All significant database operations within both `createHblMasterBooking` and `updateHblMasterBooking` are wrapped in explicit SQL transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency and atomicity.
*   **Error Handling**: A custom `HttpError` is consistently used to signal specific issues (e.g., "Unable to save HBL.") during database operations, facilitating structured error responses.
*   **Multi-Table Persistence**: Both creation and update of HBL records involve interacting with a core `hbl_master` table and several associated detail tables (`agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_hbl`, `agent_booking_routing`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_po`), reflecting a normalized database schema.
*   **Update Strategy for Lists**: For one-to-many relationship lists (routing, containers, basic POs), the common update pattern is to delete all existing child records for a given `hbl_master_id` and then insert all the new child records provided in the request payload.

## 9:08:13 AM
The provided log details changes primarily focused on the "House Bill of Lading" (HBL) functionality within a frontend application, specifically concerning booking and HBL management.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\store\api\agentBookingApi.js`**
*   **11/26/2025, 2:53:21 PM**: This file, responsible for Redux Toolkit Query API definitions related to agent bookings, saw significant expansion. New endpoints for HBL management were added: `saveHblBooking` (POST to `/hblEntry/create`) and `fetchHblBookingFormDetails` (GET to `/hblEntry`). It also included `getHblDashboard` (GET to `/hblEntry/get-hbl`). Existing endpoints for booking, ISF, and customer approval were also present, indicating a comprehensive API for booking-related operations.
*   **11/26/2025, 5:48:11 PM**: The `saveHblBooking` mutation's URL was changed from `/hblEntry/create` to `/hblEntry`, suggesting a potential simplification or consolidation of the HBL creation endpoint.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:17:24 AM**: The `saveHblBooking` mutation's URL was reverted back to `/hblEntry/create`.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:40:18 PM**: A new mutation `updateHblBooking` was added, pointing to `/hblEntry/update`, expanding the HBL API to support updates. The exported hooks were also updated to include `useUpdateHblBookingMutation`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\hbl\HBLListDetails.jsx`**
*   **11/26/2025, 2:57:40 PM**: Introduced the `HblListDetails` component, likely a dashboard or list view for HBLs. It imports `useGetHblDashboardQuery` to fetch data and `HBL_COLUMNS` for grid definitions. It includes an "Add HBL" button that navigates to `/app/booking/hbl_form`. The component initially used `isfDummyData`.
*   **11/26/2025, 2:58:49 PM**: The `ThemedGrid` component was updated to use `hblData?.data` instead of `isfDummyData` and changed the `uniqueId` prop from `agent_booking_id` to `serial_id`. This indicates the integration of live HBL data from the API.
*   **11/26/2025, 6:03:04 PM**: The `useGetHblDashboardQuery` hook was updated to accept `agent_booking_id` from the `location.state`, enabling filtering of HBLs specific to a particular booking.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:25:36 AM**: Added `console.log("dat=====location====", location);` for debugging purposes.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:56:44 PM**: The navigation state for "Add HBL" button was updated to explicitly pass `agent_booking_id` from `location.state`, ensuring consistency when creating new HBLs linked to an existing booking.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\agent.booking.js`**
*   **11/26/2025, 3:01:38 PM**: The file defines column configurations for various booking-related grids, including `BOOKING_VESSEL_COLUMN`, `BOOKING_CARGO_COLUMN`, and `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS_GRID`. The `renderCell` functions frequently use `appDateFormat` for date formatting and `Chip` components for status display.
*   **11/27/2025, 11:03:09 AM**: No functional changes were observed, indicating consistent column definitions for booking-related displays.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\actions.js`**
*   **11/26/2025, 3:13:47 PM**: This file defines various actions (Edit, Copy, View) for booking, ISF, and HBL entities, dynamically generated based on user access roles (agent, customer, admin). It introduced `getHblActions` to specifically handle HBL-related actions, initially containing only an "Edit HBL" action which navigates to `/app/booking/hbl_form`.
*   **11/26/2025, 5:33:49 PM**: The `getHblActions` function was updated to pass `agent_booking_id` in the navigation state for "Edit HBL".
*   **11/26/2025, 5:35:42 PM**: The `getHblActions` function's "Edit HBL" navigation state was further refined to include `serial_id` alongside `agent_booking_id`. This implies that HBLs are uniquely identified by `serial_id`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\hbl\HBLform.jsx`**
*   **11/26/2025, 5:55:57 PM**: This is the initial creation of the `HBLForm` component. It uses Formik for form management, Redux for state, and several internal components (`HblHeaderForms`, `HblContainerDetailsForm`, `HblRoutingForm`, `BasicPoForm`, party-related forms). It handles saving HBL data via `useSaveHblBookingMutation` and includes logic to process form values, especially parsing "name~code" strings for various parties and locations. It also incorporates keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Navigation after a successful save directs to `/app/booking`.
*   **11/26/2025, 6:11:50 PM**: Added `serial_id:location.state?.serial_id || "",` to the payload for `handleSave`, indicating that `serial_id` is now part of the HBL data being submitted.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:20:17 AM**: Modified the success navigation path from `/app/booking` to `/app/booking/hbl_form_screen` and removed `agent_booking_id` from the state object on success, which was likely a bug or an interim change.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:23:28 AM**: Re-added `agent_booking_id` to the success navigation state, drawing it from `resp.data.agent_booking_id`.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:29:45 AM**: Changed how `agent_booking_id` is determined in the success navigation, prioritizing `location.state.booking_id` if available, otherwise falling back to `resp.data.agent_booking_id`. This ensures the correct booking context is maintained after an HBL save.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:58:43 AM**: Commented out `serial_id:location.state?.serial_id || "",` from the payload, suggesting that `serial_id` might be passed differently or not directly in the payload for certain operations.
*   **11/27/2025, 10:59:07 AM**: Commented out both `booking_serial_id` and `serial_id` from the payload, implying these might be derived or passed via other means in the API calls. Also removed `agent_booking_id` from the payload for the save, which might be an oversight if it's needed for linking.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:44:36 PM**: Integrated `useUpdateHblBookingMutation` and implemented conditional logic within `handleSave` to call either `updateHblBooking` (if `formAction` is "edit" and `serial_id` exists in `location.state`) or `saveBooking`. This is a crucial change for enabling HBL editing. The payload for `saveBooking` was incorrectly left as an empty call (should have been `saveBooking(payload)`).
*   **11/27/2025, 2:44:56 PM**: Corrected the call to `saveBooking` to `saveBooking(payload)` when not in "edit" mode.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:52:40 PM**: Refined the `handleSave` logic:
    *   Explicitly defined `agent_booking_id` for the success navigation state, prioritizing `location.state.agent_booking_id` (if available from parent) or `resp?.data?.agent_booking_id`.
    *   Added error handling to explicitly check for a missing `agent_booking_id` after save.
    *   The `agent_booking_id` for the *payload* was also refined, using `location.state.agent_booking_id` primarily, but `booking_serial_id` was still commented out.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:56:53 PM**: In the `handleSave` function, the payload's `agent_booking_id` was again set, this time using `location.state.agent_booking_id || ""`, which is more consistent with how it's handled in the success navigation.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:26:27 PM**: Changed initial values for `hbldate` and `bookingdate` to `null` if undefined, instead of an empty string, likely for date picker compatibility.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:30:00 PM**: Adjusted how `agent_booking_id` is set in the payload during `handleSave`, now checking `location.state.booking_id || location.state.agent_booking_id || ""` to ensure the correct ID is passed for association.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:33:27 PM**: Reverted `agent_booking_id` logic in `handleSave` payload to `location.state.booking_id || ""` and updated success navigation to `location.state.agent_booking_id || resp.data.agent_booking_id`. This indicates an ongoing refinement of how booking IDs are passed between components and API calls.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:49:59 PM**: In `handleSave`, the `saveBooking` mutation for "add" now explicitly passes the payload including `agent_booking_id` from `location.state`. This fixes a previous potential issue where `agent_booking_id` was not being correctly associated with new HBLs.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\booking\HblEntry.jsx`**
*   **11/27/2025, 12:05:38 PM**: This file imports and uses `HblEntryForm` (which is likely `HBLform` renamed or an alias). It fetches HBL details using `useFetchHblBookingFormDetailsQuery` based on `agent_booking_id` from `useLocation` state. It also includes `useEffect` hooks to initialize Redux lists (`containerList`, `routingList`) and reset state on unmount.
*   **11/27/2025, 12:07:36 PM**: No functional changes were observed.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\hbl\HblEntryFormScreen.jsx`**
*   **11/27/2025, 12:07:51 PM**: This new component acts as a wrapper for `HBLForm`, handling the data fetching for HBL details based on `agent_booking_id` from `location.state`. It also manages modals for adding/viewing parties and error popups. It dispatches actions (`initializeLists`, `resetHblEntryForm`) to Redux store. There was a commented-out section for a `hblDetails` query, followed by an active one.
*   **11/27/2025, 12:08:00 PM**: No functional changes were observed.
*   **11/27/2025, 12:08:31 PM**: The `useFetchHblBookingFormDetailsQuery` was updated to fetch HBL details using `serial_id` instead of `agent_booking_id` when `state` is present, suggesting a shift to using `serial_id` as the primary identifier for fetching HBL forms.
*   **11/27/2025, 12:08:43 PM**: Corrected the variable name for fetched HBL data from `hblBbookingDetails` to `hblDetails`.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:11:16 PM**: The query for `useFetchHblBookingFormDetailsQuery` was changed back to use `state.booking_serial_id` when `isEdit` is true, but then immediately reverted this change in the next log entry. This indicates some back-and-forth or experimentation with the key used for fetching HBL details.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:12:29 PM**: The query for `useFetchHblBookingFormDetailsQuery` was changed back to use `state.serial_id` when `isEdit` is true. This confirms `serial_id` is the intended primary key for editing existing HBLs.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:20:00 PM**: The `useFetchHblBookingFormDetailsQuery` was further refined to explicitly check `isEdit && state?.serial_id` before attempting to fetch, ensuring the query is only made when an HBL is being edited.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/26/2025, 2:53:21 PM**: Initial major update to `agentBookingApi.js` for HBL functionality.

*   **11/27/2025, 12:07:51 PM**: Introduction of `HblEntryFormScreen.jsx` to wrap `HBLForm` with data fetching and modal logic.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:40:18 PM**: `agentBookingApi.js` updated to include `updateHblBooking` mutation, enabling editing of HBLs.
*   **11/27/2025, 2:44:36 PM** and **2:44:56 PM**: `HBLform.jsx` integrated the `updateHblBooking` mutation, distinguishing between create and update operations.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:20:00 PM**: `HblEntryFormScreen.jsx` improved data fetching logic for HBL editing.
*   **11/27/2025, 3:49:59 PM**: Final refinement in `HBLform.jsx` for passing `agent_booking_id` during HBL creation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **HBL Feature Development**: The changes clearly indicate a concentrated effort to implement or refine the House Bill of Lading (HBL) feature, covering API endpoints, list views, and detailed forms.
*   **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**: All API interactions are handled using RTK Query (`createApi`, `fetchBaseQuery`, `builder.mutation`, `builder.query`, `invalidatesTags`, `providesTags`), demonstrating a consistent pattern for data fetching and state management in the frontend.
*   **`useLocation` for State Passing**: Navigation and data passing between components heavily rely on `useLocation().state`, especially for `agent_booking_id`, `serial_id`, and `formAction` (add/edit/copy). This pattern is used to maintain context across different screens.
*   **`formAction` Prop**: The `formAction` prop (values like "add", "edit", "copy") is a recurring pattern used to control the behavior and initial values of forms, like `HBLForm`.
*   **Data Transformation for Forms/APIs**: There's a consistent pattern of transforming data, especially for party and location fields (e.g., `recoverValue` function splitting "name~code" strings), before sending it to the API. Similarly, fetched data is transformed (`convertToArray`, remapping field names) for display in forms.
*   **Conditional Data Fetching with `skipToken`**: The `skipToken` from RTK Query is frequently used to prevent queries from firing when necessary parameters (like `agent_booking_id` or `serial_id`) are not yet available, optimizing network requests.
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback**: `toast` notifications and `setAlertConfig` for modal error messages are consistently used to provide user feedback on API call results.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: The use of `useKeyboardShortcut` hook for actions like edit, view, add party, and save indicates an emphasis on improving user experience and efficiency.
*   **`serial_id` vs. `agent_booking_id`**: There's an evolving understanding and consistent refinement of whether `serial_id` or `agent_booking_id` is the primary identifier for HBL-related operations, particularly for fetching and updating HBL forms. `serial_id` seems to be becoming the specific identifier for an HBL record, while `agent_booking_id` links it to a broader booking context.
*   **Console Logging for Debugging**: Frequent `console.log` statements throughout the code changes suggest active debugging during development.
