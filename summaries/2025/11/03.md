# Activity Summary for 11/3/2025

## 10:50:05 AM
The provided logs indicate a significant refactoring effort, primarily focusing on migrating UI components and styling from Material-UI (MUI) to Tailwind CSS, alongside general component enhancement and consolidation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11/3/2025, 10:23:42 AM)**: The component `ViewContainer` was using `@mui/material` components for layout (`Box`, `Stack`, `ThemeTabs`). It managed custom dashboard views, allowing users to select up to 9 metrics from "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" categories. It included functionality for saving, updating, deleting, and auditing these views, utilizing RTK Query hooks (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`). Imports were updated to use path aliases, and `ANALYTICS_VIEW_AUDIT_COLUMNS` path was changed.
    *   **Major Refactor (11/3/2025, 10:28:43 AM)**: This was a pivotal change, renaming the component to `ViewContainerTailwind` and commencing a full migration to Tailwind CSS. All `@mui/material` layout components were replaced with standard `div` elements styled with Tailwind classes. The `ThemeTabs` component was replaced by a new `RadioNav` component, and the `tabData` values were updated from generic "1", "2" to descriptive "containerWise", "mblWise". The loading spinner was also replaced with a Tailwind-based animation.
    *   **Subsequent Adjustments (11/3/2025, 10:29:50 AM - 10:40:10 AM)**: Following the Tailwind migration, several iterative changes occurred:
        *   Initial wrapper styling for the main container was removed, and then specific input styling (native `input`) was removed in favor of the custom `InputBox` component (10:32:06 AM, 10:32:52 AM).
        *   The placement of the `RadioNav` relative to the "View Name" input was adjusted (10:31:08 AM).
        *   A `my-6` margin was added to the input section (10:34:28 AM).
        *   Finally, the component was renamed back to `ViewContainer` (10:40:10 AM), indicating the `Tailwind` suffix was temporary during the migration process.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:35:36 AM)**: This file was introduced to render a tree-like view of metrics with collapsible groups. It uses a custom `Checkbox` component and icons from `@heroicons/react` and `@mui/icons-material`. Styling is entirely based on Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Styling Refinements (11/3/2025, 10:36:01 AM - 10:38:12 AM)**: Minor adjustments were made to the group header button's border styling, including an accidental `b` class which was quickly corrected, and a more specific custom property for the `border-bottom` was applied (10:37:07 AM).
    *   **Label Styling (11/3/2025, 10:47:30 AM - 10:48:45 AM)**: The `span` element displaying the metric name was initially given an `input-title` class, which was then changed to a direct Tailwind class `text-sm font-medium`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\app-drawer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:40:50 AM)**: This component was added as a reusable `AppDrawer`, implementing a fixed-position right-aligned drawer using Tailwind CSS. It handles preventing body scroll when open and includes a header with a title and a close button (`IoClose`).
    *   **Header Styling and Width Adjustments (11/3/2025, 10:41:14 AM - 10:45:56 AM)**: The header's background (`bg-blue-600`) and text color (`text-white`) were removed, followed by the removal of its bottom border (10:42:17 AM). A series of minor changes to the drawer's `width` were logged, indicating testing or iteration on the appropriate size (from `w-135` up to `w-200`, then `w-180`, `w-165`, and finally `w-[42rem]`).
    *   **Reversions and Debugging (11/3/2025, 10:46:15 AM - 10:46:46 AM)**: The drawer width was reverted to `w-165`, the header border was removed again, and the close button's hover state changed back. A temporary "jj" string was added to the drawer's content area for debugging and then removed.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\radio-nav.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:48:23 AM)**: This new component was introduced to provide a radio-button-like navigation, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and `clsx`/`twMerge` for class management. It uses `Field` and `Label` components from a shared `fieldset` kit.
    *   **Minor Correction (11/3/2025, 10:48:30 AM)**: A trailing "ll" from the `Label` component was removed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Tailwind CSS Migration**: The most prominent pattern is the ongoing migration from MUI-based styling to Tailwind CSS across multiple components. This involves replacing MUI components with standard HTML elements and applying Tailwind utility classes.
*   **Component Modularity and Reusability**: New common components like `AppDrawer` and `RadioNav` are being introduced, suggesting an effort to create a consistent, reusable component library, likely part of a broader design system (e.g., `@components/kit`).
*   **Iterative UI/Styling Development**: Numerous small, sequential changes to Tailwind classes (e.g., `width` adjustments in `AppDrawer`, border styles, font styling) indicate an iterative development process for fine-tuning the user interface.
*   **Path Aliases**: Consistent use of path aliases like `@components/common`, `store/api`, `data/coulmns` for imports across files, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code structure.
*   **Debugging Artifacts**: The presence and removal of temporary text ("jj") highlight active development and testing within the components.

## 12:26:12 PM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on enhancing analytics and reporting functionalities within a backend system. The updates span several service files and the main analytics routing configuration, showing iterative development, debugging, and refactoring.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM)**: This file defined `getExportData` for generating analytics exports, distinguishing between booking and non-booking reports. It included a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" in data and implemented specific `DISTINCT ON` clauses for MBL-wise reports and a TEU filter for non-booking reports.
    *   **Intermediate Edits (11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM & 11:52:44 AM)**: These timestamps reveal a period of code instability, marked by significant duplication of interfaces and helper functions, temporary import path changes for the database utility (`@src/common/db` vs `@src/common/util/database`), and introduction of syntax errors (`co logger.error`). This suggests a complex merge or copy-paste operation.
    *   **Refactoring & Cleanup (11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM & 11:56:23 AM)**: The subsequent changes focused on resolving the duplication, correcting syntax errors, and consolidating interface definitions. `NextFunction` was properly imported, query parameter access was explicitly typed, and debugging `console.log` statements were added (e.g., `===request12345===>`, `===userCode===>`, `===mainQuery===>`). The MBL-wise TEU filter was updated with explicit type annotations for `obj` and `item`. The `query` import was stabilized to `@src/common/util/database`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Query Definition (11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM)**: This file defines `getMonthValue` and `bookingQuery`. The `bookingQuery` function dynamically generates complex SQL snippets for various booking reports, including detailed `CASE WHEN` logic to categorize day differences into weekly buckets for stacked bar visualizations. A new filter `m.t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date IS NOT NULL` was added to the "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)" query.
    *   **No Functional Change (11/3/2025, 11:58:42 AM)**: The code content remained identical to the previous timestamp, likely a minor save operation.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **Query Builder Introduction (11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM)**: This file introduced `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function designed to construct specific SQL queries for different booking-related analytics, such as "Booking Date to Actual Departure" and its MBL-wise and stacked bar variants. It utilizes `WITH` clauses for aggregation and calculates percentages. It also updates a `customizer` object with report-specific metadata.
    *   **No Functional Change (11/3/2025, 12:16:05 PM)**: The code content remained identical to the previous timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **Centralized Reporting (11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM)**: The `getTableDataReports` function was introduced as a central dispatcher for various analytics reports. It integrates multiple query builders (chassis, booking, container, departure, general) and selects the appropriate one based on the `type` parameter in the request. It also includes debugging output for the generated SQL queries.
    *   **Minor Debugging (11/3/2025, 12:08:25 PM)**: A `console.log(error)` was added within the catch block, alongside the existing `logger.info(error)`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **Container Reporting (11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM)**: The `getContainerReports` function was added to generate reports based on container data, allowing grouping by columns like `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`, or `trucker`. It constructs dynamic SQL queries with `DISTINCT ON` clauses and applies a special condition for trucker-based TEU reports.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM)**: This update introduced explicit interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) for better type safety and code clarity. Variable access for `companyname` and `access` was streamlined. Comments were added to enhance readability, and a minor typo (`ConditionForTueByTrucker` to `ConditionForTeuByTrucker`) was corrected.
    *   **Minor Debugging (11/3/2025, 12:16:36 PM)**: A `console.log("===reqquery",req.query);` was added at the start of the `getContainerReports` function for debugging purposes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **New Routes (11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM)**: This file was updated to register new GET endpoints for various analytics reports, including TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and general Table Data, linking them to their respective service functions (e.g., `getTEUReports`, `getContainerReports`, `getTableDataReports`). A duplicate route definition for `Paths.Analytics.Get` was observed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Date Handling**: A `defaultDateRange()` utility is frequently used across services to provide fallback `fromDate` and `toDate` values, ensuring reports always have a defined time window.
*   **User Context and Authorization**: `getUserObject` is consistently invoked across multiple services to extract `companyname` and `usercode` from the authenticated request, facilitating company-specific data filtering and access control.
*   **Modular Query Generation**: The system employs a modular approach with dedicated query builder functions (e.g., `bookingQueryBuilder`, `chassisQueryBuilder`) for different categories of reports. These builders dynamically construct SQL queries based on request parameters.
*   **`DISTINCT ON` for Uniqueness**: Many SQL queries, particularly those involving containers, utilize the `DISTINCT ON (m.voyage, m.contno, ...)` clause to prevent duplicate entries, ensuring accurate counts and calculations. For MBL-wise reports, this logic adapts to the `mblno`.
*   **Standardized Data Transformation**: The `replaceColumnHandler` function demonstrates a pattern of normalizing specific data values (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES") for consistency across reports.
*   **Debugging and Logging**: Throughout the changes, `console.log` and `logger.info` statements are extensively used to track request parameters, intermediate values, and generated SQL queries, indicating an active debugging and development process.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: All service functions consistently wrap their logic in `try-catch` blocks, logging errors and returning a standard `500 Internal Server Error` response, ensuring system stability.
*   **Type Safety Improvement**: The introduction of specific interfaces (e.g., `ContainerReportQuery`) in refactored code indicates a push towards improving type safety and code maintainability.
*   **API Expansion**: The `analyticsRoutes.ts` updates show a clear pattern of adding new API endpoints to expose the growing set of analytics reports.

## 1:26:12 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining analytics and reporting functionalities across several service files and query utilities, with a strong emphasis on dynamic SQL generation, data processing, and type safety improvements.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM - 11:52:09 AM**: Initial or minor saves of the `getExportData` controller, which handles exporting data for booking and non-booking reports. It includes logic for date range defaults, user/company object retrieval, column selection, and a `replaceColumnHandler` function to normalize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES". A specific filter for MBL-wise TEU reports is also present.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM - 11:52:44 AM**: Introduced temporary code inconsistencies, including duplicated `Response` imports, adding `NextFunction` (which wasn't used), and changing the `query` utility import path (to `@src/common/db` from `@src/common/util/database`), which was later reverted. There were also duplicated `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface definitions and a typo (`co logger.error`) in the catch block that was corrected to `console.log("error", error)`.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM**: The `query` import was temporarily removed, `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface was simplified by removing `companyname` and `access` (despite still being used in the code), and numerous `console.log` statements were added for debugging request parameters, user codes, main queries, and exported data. The `getUserObject` call was made more explicit in casting query parameters.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:56:23 AM**: The `query` utility import path was correctly restored to `@src/common/util/database`, and `nonBookingQuery` was re-imported, resolving previous issues. The `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface still omits `companyname` and `access` fields, indicating a type safety gap, but the debugging logs and previous functional changes remained.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM - 11:58:42 AM**: Defines `getMonthValue` and `bookingQuery` functions. `bookingQuery` generates complex SQL WHERE clauses and SELECT components for various booking reports, including stacked bar chart variations, incorporating dynamic filtering based on month, week, or quarter. It extensively uses `DISTINCT ON` for container/MBL uniqueness and `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)` for date differences.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM - 1:18:17 PM**: Implements `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function responsible for constructing full SQL queries for numerous booking-related analytics, including "Booking Date to Actual Departure" and its MBL-wise and stacked bar variants. These queries involve CTEs (`WITH t AS`), aggregation (AVG, COUNT), date difference calculations, and dynamic column selection using `getColumnsByCategory` and date filtering via `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`.
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:57 PM - 1:23:26 PM**: Introduced type safety improvements by defining `Customizer` and refining the `reportName` type in the `QueryBuilderI` interface, initially allowing `string[]` and later restricting it to `string | undefined`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM - 12:08:25 PM**: The `getTableDataReports` function orchestrates analytics reports by delegating query building to specialized builder functions (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`) based on the requested report `type`. It handles default date ranges, retrieves user/company context, and includes extensive `if/else if` conditions for report type routing. A `console.log(error)` was added to the catch block in the later timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM**: The `getContainerReports` function constructs SQL queries for container reports, dynamically grouping data by columns like `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`, or `trucker`. It uses `replaceValueInQuery` for data normalization and specific conditions for trucker-related data (`type_of_move IN ('FDC','FDN')`).
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM**: Significant type safety enhancements were made by introducing `ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, and `AnalyticsRow` interfaces. Query parameter handling was refactored, and explicit typing was applied to `user_id` and `reportName` for `getColumnsByCategory`. SQL query sections were also commented for improved readability.
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:16:36 PM**: A `console.log("===reqquery", req.query);` was added for debugging purposes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM**: This file saw a significant expansion of analytics routes. New GET endpoints were added for various report types, including TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and general Table Data, each mapping to its respective service function (e.g., `getTEUReports`, `getCBMReports`, `getContainerReports`, `getTransitReports`, `getTableDataReports`).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM**: This utility file underwent several improvements. Commented-out code was removed, and interfaces like `UserRow` were introduced for clarity. The `getUserObject` function's return type was made explicit. `getExcelSelectedColumns` logic was refined, especially for the "BL Release KPI" report, and the base columns for export were expanded significantly. The `dateFilterOnExport` function was updated to use `moment.format("MM/DD/YYYY")` for consistent date formatting. Finally, the `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array was considerably extended with many new key-name mappings, indicating a broader range of data available for export.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Date Range Management:** A consistent `defaultDateRange()` utility is used to set a 365-day range when `fromDate` or `toDate` are not provided in requests across multiple services.
*   **User and Company Context:** The `getUserObject` helper is frequently invoked to establish the `CompanyName` and `userCode` for current operations, critical for data filtering in a multi-tenant environment.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation:** A pervasive pattern is the construction of SQL queries dynamically based on report parameters, column choices, and date ranges. This is evident in `export.query.ts`, `booking.query.ts`, `containerService.ts`, and `analyticsExportService.ts`.
*   **Data Normalization:** The need to replace "LONG BEACH" with "LOS ANGELES" is a recurring theme, handled both as a post-processing step in `analyticsExportService.ts` and directly within SQL queries using `replaceValueInQuery` in `containerService.ts`.
*   **Modularity in Query Builders:** The `tableService.ts` demonstrates a clear architectural pattern of delegating specific report query logic to dedicated builder functions (`chassis.query`, `booking.query`, `container.query`, `departure.query`, `general.query`), enhancing organization and maintainability.
*   **Type Safety Evolution:** There is a visible trend toward improving code clarity and robustness through the introduction and refinement of TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `AnalyticsControllerQuery`, `ContainerReportQuery`, `QueryBuilderI`, `Customizer`) across several files.
*   **Extensive Logging:** `logger.info` and `logger.error` are consistently used for operational logging, and `console.log` statements were frequently added during development for debugging, especially in `analyticsExportService.ts` and `containerService.ts`.
*   **SQL Query Structure:** Common SQL constructs include `DISTINCT ON (...)` for unique record selection, `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)` for date calculations, and `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END` for conditional logic and data categorization.
*   **Data Export Expansion:** The `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array in `analytics.ts` shows a significant increase in available exportable columns, suggesting a major enhancement to the reporting capabilities.

## 1:26:36 PM
The changes primarily focus on enhancing the analytics section of a frontend application, specifically concerning report configuration, data processing, chart rendering, and Excel export functionalities. All modifications occurred on November 3, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\config\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:04:01 PM & 12:04:54 PM**
    *   This file defines comprehensive analytics configurations.
    *   `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` outlines various CBM and TEU reports grouped by dimensions like ocean freight carrier, port, supplier, and country.
    *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` lists an extensive set of columns for Excel exports, covering detailed shipment information from file numbers and account names to container specifics and various date milestones (original/live ETD, ETA, discharge, availability, delivery, return).
    *   `CargoReadyToETD10Days` defines a smaller set of columns for a specific report focusing on cargo readiness and ETD.
    *   `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` provides headers for a wide array of reports, including Container Wise (CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit) and MBL Wise (CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit) metrics, as well as several new Chassis and Container lifecycle reports such as "Chassis Pick-Up Date vs Final Delivery", "Average Days Chassis Used", "Container Discharge vs Availability", and "Containers Outgated but Not Returned". The second timestamp for this file shows no content change, indicating a save operation without modification.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:06:05 PM**
    *   Introduced robust TypeScript type definitions (`AnalyticsData`, `Customizer`, `Metric`, `Endpoint`, `FormatSettings`, `MetricsPackageReturn`) for various analytics-related data structures, significantly improving type safety.
    *   The `metricsPackageHandler` function was converted to be strongly typed, responsible for processing raw analytics data into a structured object for UI consumption, including determining chart types and calculation methods (e.g., total, average).
    *   Added `reportFormula` for dynamically generating formula strings for reports like "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" based on date columns.
    *   Implemented `weekDateFormater` for consistent date formatting.
    *   The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function was added, capable of generating Excel reports using `ExcelJS`. This function handles dynamic header adjustments based on period filters and chart types (especially for "StackedBar" and "transitBar"). It includes specific logic for data mapping and calculation summaries (Average, Total) for various stacked bar reports like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI".
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:37:19 PM**
    *   No visible changes in code content from the previous timestamp, indicating a save operation.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:38:24 PM**
    *   Extended the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function to include export logic for a new report: `"Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)"`, handling data mapping for "This Quarter" and "Last Quarter" based on period filters.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\StackedBarChart.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:24:18 PM**
    *   Initial implementation of the `StackedBarChart` component using `ReactApexChart`. It configures a horizontal stacked bar chart with dynamic Y-axis categories based on period filters (month, week, quarter) and a tooltip that displays values as both absolute numbers and percentages. Basic styling and a loading state were included.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:25:35 PM**
    *   A `color="red"` attribute was temporarily added to the `Tooltip` component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:25:59 PM**
    *   The temporary `Tooltip` color attribute was removed, and "kk" was briefly added to the displayed report name (likely for debugging).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:26:13 PM**
    *   The "kk" debugging text was removed, reverting the component's title display to the original report name.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:29:16 PM**
    *   **Major Refinement:** The component was refactored with comprehensive TypeScript type definitions (`ChartDataItem`, `ChartProps`), converted to a `React.FC`, and incorporated Tailwind CSS classes for styling, replacing inline styles. Chart `colors` were updated for better visual distinction (`["#09090B", "#E5E5E5"]`), legend labels were explicitly colored black, and tooltip styling was improved. Data processing in `useEffect` was made more robust by ensuring numeric values for chart series.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:30:37 PM**
    *   The chart `colors` array was slightly adjusted from `["#09090B", "#E5E5E5"]` to `["#09090B", "#71717A"]` (a darker gray).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:31:43 PM**
    *   No visible changes in code content from the previous timestamp.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:32:13 PM**
    *   The "kk" debugging text was again temporarily added to the displayed report name.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:33:02 PM**
    *   The "kk" debugging text was removed. Styling for the chart title `div` was simplified by removing explicit `text-align`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, and `color` styles, relying more on inherited or surrounding Tailwind classes.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:33:10 PM**
    *   The title styling was reverted to use the more explicit Tailwind classes: `text-center text-gray-800 font-semibold text-base truncate w-[90%] mx-auto`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:40:45 PM**
    *   This component manages the overall analytics dashboard layout and interactions.
    *   It uses `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to reorder (`moveItem`) and resize (`saveSize`) metric widgets, with changes persisted via API calls (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`).
    *   Redux is integrated (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management of metrics and settings.
    *   Introduced TypeScript types (`UserType`, `MetricItem`) for user data and metric items.
    *   `fetchSingleReport` function handles fetching individual report data from an API (`useLazyFetchReportQuery`), applying various filters, and processing the response using `metricsPackageHandler` before updating the Redux store.
    *   The component renders a grid (`id="metric-board"`, `grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-4`) composed of `ResizableGridItem`s, each housing a `MetricsBox`.

## 2:26:15 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining and extending the analytics and reporting functionality within the backend system. This includes improvements to data querying, export mechanisms, and report generation, with a strong emphasis on type safety and dynamic SQL construction.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM - 11:52:09 AM**: The initial state of the `getExportData` controller processes booking and non-booking reports, applies a `replaceColumnHandler` for port name consistency (Long Beach to Los Angeles), and includes a specific MBLwise TEU filter. It uses various utility functions for date range, column queries, user object retrieval, and database interaction.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM - 11:52:44 AM**: This period introduced temporary issues, including duplicate imports and interface declarations, a typo (`co logger.error`), and a change in the database `query` import path from `@src/common/util/database` to `@src/common/db`. These commits appear to be transitional, with some debugging (`console.log("error",error)`) being added.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM - 11:56:23 AM**: A significant cleanup and refactoring occurred. Duplicate code was removed, the `query` import path was reverted to `@src/common/util/database`, and the `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface was streamlined by removing `companyname` and `access` as direct properties, instead passing them explicitly to the `getUserObject` utility. Additional `console.log` statements were added for debugging query generation and user code. The MBLwise TEU filter logic was slightly adjusted to use a generic `obj` for tracking seen items.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM - 11:58:42 AM**: This file, introduced or first logged during this period, defines `getMonthValue` and a comprehensive `bookingQuery` function. `bookingQuery` contains a large map of SQL query fragments for various booking-related reports, including "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to Estimated Departure", and "Booking Date to POD Arrival", with specific logic for "Stacked Bar" and "MBL Wise" variations. Queries frequently check for `NOT NULL` and exclude `'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'` dates.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM - 1:18:17 PM**: This file defines `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function responsible for constructing SQL queries and customizing report metadata (like date ranges, calculation types, and selected columns) for various booking-related analytics. It dynamically generates queries for reports such as "BookingDatetoActualDeparture" and its MBL-wise and stacked bar variants.
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:57 PM - 1:29:32 PM**: A series of type-safety improvements were made. The `QueryBuilderI` interface was updated, and dedicated `Customizer`, `CalColumn`, and `CalColumnConfig` interfaces were introduced and progressively refined to explicitly define the structure of the `customizer` object, enhancing code clarity and maintainability. This included adding properties like `mblwise` and `chartType` to the `Customizer` interface.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM - 12:08:25 PM**: The `getTableDataReports` controller was updated to handle a wide array of analytics report types (chassis, booking/cargo-ready, containers, departures, general). It acts as a router, dispatching to different `queryBuilder` functions based on the `type` parameter from the request. It consistently retrieves user and company information and logs the generated SQL query for debugging, adding `console.log(error)` for catch block in the latter timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM**: The `getContainerReports` controller dynamically constructs SQL queries for container-specific analytics, allowing grouping by columns like `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`, or `trucker`. It includes logic for `DISTINCT ON` container tracking and uses `replaceValueInQuery` for data standardization.
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM - 12:16:36 PM**: This file underwent significant refactoring for improved type safety and readability. Explicit interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) were introduced. The logic for user/company retrieval was streamlined, and the `query` function was updated to use a generic type. A minor debugging `console.log("===reqquery",req.query)` was added.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM**: This route file was extended to include new endpoints for various analytics reports, specifically for TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and general Table Data, integrating the newly developed service functions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM**: This utility file was enhanced with several helper functions: `defaultDateRange` for consistent date defaults, `replaceValueInQuery` for standardizing column values (e.g., port names), `getUserObject` for managing user and company context (including ADMIN access logic), `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` for dynamic SQL grouping/ordering based on display preferences (month, week, quarter), `getExcelSelectedColumns` to select relevant columns for report exports, and `dateFilterOnExport` to clean and format date fields in export data. It also defines a comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dynamic SQL Query Generation:** A prominent pattern is the dynamic construction of complex SQL queries using template literals, which vary based on report type, filters, and display options. This is evident in `analyticsExportService`, `export.query`, `booking.query`, `tableService`, and `containerService`.
*   **Date Normalization:** Dates are consistently handled with default ranges (`defaultDateRange`), formatted for SQL queries (`'${date}'::timestamp`), and validated/formatted for export (`dateFilterOnExport`). Invalid dates (e.g., `'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'`) are explicitly filtered out in SQL queries.
*   **User and Company Context:** The `getUserObject` utility is central to retrieving and managing user and company information, often passed to query builders to scope data.
*   **Data Standardization:** The conversion of "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" is implemented both in `replaceColumnHandler` within a service and via `replaceValueInQuery` utility, highlighting a need for consistent data representation.
*   **Type Safety and Refactoring:** Later commits, particularly in `booking.query.ts` and `containerService.ts`, show a clear trend towards introducing and refining TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `Customizer`, `QueryBuilderI`) to improve type safety, code structure, and maintainability.
*   **Reporting Diversity:** The system supports a wide range of analytics reports, categorized by subject (booking, containers, chassis, departures, general) and presentation (simple data, MBL-wise, stacked bar charts, Excel exports).
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent use of `console.log` and `logger.info` statements throughout the code suggests active development and debugging, with some debugging lines being temporary.

## 2:26:48 PM
The code changes, primarily occurring on November 3, 2025, between 12:00 PM and 2:30 PM, are focused on enhancing the analytics dashboard functionality within the `t360-frontend-v2` project. Key updates span across configuration, utility methods, and various React components responsible for rendering and interacting with analytics charts and reports.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`src\config\analytics.ts`** (11/3/2025, 12:04:01 PM & 12:04:54 PM): This file defines various analytics report configurations, including `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`, `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`, `CargoReadyToETD10Days`, and `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`. No significant content changes were observed between the two timestamps, indicating a stable configuration for report structures and data columns.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`** (11/3/2025, 12:06:05 PM, 12:37:19 PM, & 12:38:24 PM): This file contains utility functions for analytics. The primary change at 12:38:24 PM was an expansion of the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function to handle a new report type, "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)", specifically for "StackedBar" charts across different time periods (month, week, quarter), indicating extended data export capabilities. Type definitions for input parameters and return types were also introduced for improved code quality.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\StackedBarChart.tsx`** (Numerous timestamps from 11/3/2025, 12:24:18 PM to 2:02:37 PM): This component underwent extensive iterative development.
    *   Early changes focused on integrating TypeScript interfaces and defining chart options like colors (`["#09090B", "#E5E5E5"]` then `["#09090B", "#71717A"]`).
    *   Subsequent updates refined chart styling, particularly for tooltips. Initially using default ApexCharts tooltip formatters, there was a shift towards custom HTML tooltips (at 1:51:15 PM, 1:53:13 PM, and 2:01:47 PM) to achieve a consistent white background, gray border, and black text, along with displaying value and percentage.
    *   Styling for chart title (truncation, font-weight, color) and loading states also saw adjustments.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 12:40:45 PM & 2:11:51 PM): This core component manages the analytics grid, handling metric reordering, resizing, and data fetching. The main changes involved explicitly defining TypeScript types for user data (`UserType`) and metric items (`MetricItem`), and specifying Redux state types (`RootState`, `AppDispatch`) for `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`** (Numerous timestamps from 11/3/2025, 1:31:55 PM to 1:35:29 PM): This component renders individual metric boxes. It saw iterative updates similar to `StackedBarChart.tsx` regarding TypeScript type definitions for props and state. There was a back-and-forth on strict Redux state typing (`state.analytics` vs `state.analyticSlice`) and component inclusion (`MetricToolbar` within `ThemedModal`).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:39:15 PM, 1:39:26 PM, & 1:42:37 PM): This component provides filtering and chart view options. A `RadioNav` component for chart type selection (bar, pie, line) was introduced and then commented out, suggesting an experimental feature that was reverted. The `SwitchBox` component remained the primary chart type selector.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\SwitchBox.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:42:09 PM & 1:43:37 PM): A reusable chart type selector component. No notable content changes were observed, focusing on consistent styling and functionality.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\PieChart.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:45:10 PM & 1:45:37 PM): Introduced a `Tooltip` component for the chart title and fixed a color string in the legend.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\LineChart.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:47:50 PM & 1:47:56 PM): Added a `Tooltip` component for the chart title.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\PdfRenderer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:03:39 PM to 2:06:08 PM): This component prepares content for PDF export. It was updated to include a company logo (`logo-v2.svg`), enhance title styling with truncation, and improve robustness by adding nullish coalescing operators for client name and date range display.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`** (Numerous timestamps from 11/3/2025, 2:07:36 PM to 2:21:06 PM): Manages export options (Excel, PDF) and full-screen view.
    *   The PDF export functionality was a major focus, migrating from simple icon buttons to a more complex flow involving `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for rendering chart components within a hidden DOM element before generating the PDF. This also involved iterative changes to ensure the correct styling and loading indicators.
    *   A significant revert at 2:10:32 PM temporarily switched back to MUI `Button`/`Chip` components from custom Tailwind-styled ones and changed Redux state access, but this was mostly undone in subsequent commits (2:12:00 PM, 2:12:06 PM, 2:12:20 PM), restoring the previous state management and component usage.
    *   At 2:15:20 PM, `html2canvas` options were updated to explicitly set `backgroundColor: "#ffffff"` for PDF generation, likely to address issues with transparent or modern CSS color formats (e.g., `oklch`). This was then reverted and re-reverted.
    *   Final adjustments involved explicit inline styling for PDF icons.
*   **`src\index.css`** (11/3/2025, 2:17:41 PM & 2:17:53 PM): The global CSS file. At 2:17:53 PM, new color variables (`--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-danger`) were added to the `@theme` block, utilizing the `oklch` color format, signifying an expansion of the application's design system.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:22:07 PM & 2:23:38 PM): Manages custom dashboard creation and editing. The change at 2:23:38 PM simplified the `Loader` component usage, removing a specific `screen="modal"` prop.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:24:22 PM): The main analytics toolbar. The `downloadDashboardPDF` function was significantly refactored to use `Image` and `getBase64Image` for robust logo rendering in PDFs, explicitly handling image loading and potential issues with `html2canvas` for local assets. Older, less stable PDF export code was commented out.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Development on Analytics:** All changes are concentrated within the analytics feature, suggesting active development or bug fixing for this module.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** A consistent effort is observed to introduce and refine TypeScript interfaces and explicit typing across components and utility functions, enhancing code maintainability and error checking.
*   **Charting and Reporting Enhancements:** There's a strong focus on improving the visual presentation and export functionality of charts, particularly stacked bar charts, including detailed tooltip customization and robust PDF export.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Many files show multiple commits within minutes, indicating a highly iterative development process with frequent small adjustments, debugging (often using `console.log`), and experimentation with styling and component behavior.
*   **Redux State Management:** Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) is consistently used for managing application state across different analytics components.
*   **PDF Export Complexity:** The PDF export feature seems to be a complex area, undergoing several revisions to handle image rendering, styling, and general stability across different chart types. The use of `html2canvas` (and `html2canvas-pro`) and `jsPDF` is central to this.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Efforts were made to standardize styling, including explicit color definitions (e.g., black and gray palettes for charts, text colors, tooltip backgrounds) and usage of Tailwind CSS classes and MUI components.
