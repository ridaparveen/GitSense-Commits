# Activity Summary for 11/3/2025

## 10:50:05 AM
The provided logs indicate a significant refactoring effort, primarily focusing on migrating UI components and styling from Material-UI (MUI) to Tailwind CSS, alongside general component enhancement and consolidation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11/3/2025, 10:23:42 AM)**: The component `ViewContainer` was using `@mui/material` components for layout (`Box`, `Stack`, `ThemeTabs`). It managed custom dashboard views, allowing users to select up to 9 metrics from "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" categories. It included functionality for saving, updating, deleting, and auditing these views, utilizing RTK Query hooks (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`). Imports were updated to use path aliases, and `ANALYTICS_VIEW_AUDIT_COLUMNS` path was changed.
    *   **Major Refactor (11/3/2025, 10:28:43 AM)**: This was a pivotal change, renaming the component to `ViewContainerTailwind` and commencing a full migration to Tailwind CSS. All `@mui/material` layout components were replaced with standard `div` elements styled with Tailwind classes. The `ThemeTabs` component was replaced by a new `RadioNav` component, and the `tabData` values were updated from generic "1", "2" to descriptive "containerWise", "mblWise". The loading spinner was also replaced with a Tailwind-based animation.
    *   **Subsequent Adjustments (11/3/2025, 10:29:50 AM - 10:40:10 AM)**: Following the Tailwind migration, several iterative changes occurred:
        *   Initial wrapper styling for the main container was removed, and then specific input styling (native `input`) was removed in favor of the custom `InputBox` component (10:32:06 AM, 10:32:52 AM).
        *   The placement of the `RadioNav` relative to the "View Name" input was adjusted (10:31:08 AM).
        *   A `my-6` margin was added to the input section (10:34:28 AM).
        *   Finally, the component was renamed back to `ViewContainer` (10:40:10 AM), indicating the `Tailwind` suffix was temporary during the migration process.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:35:36 AM)**: This file was introduced to render a tree-like view of metrics with collapsible groups. It uses a custom `Checkbox` component and icons from `@heroicons/react` and `@mui/icons-material`. Styling is entirely based on Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Styling Refinements (11/3/2025, 10:36:01 AM - 10:38:12 AM)**: Minor adjustments were made to the group header button's border styling, including an accidental `b` class which was quickly corrected, and a more specific custom property for the `border-bottom` was applied (10:37:07 AM).
    *   **Label Styling (11/3/2025, 10:47:30 AM - 10:48:45 AM)**: The `span` element displaying the metric name was initially given an `input-title` class, which was then changed to a direct Tailwind class `text-sm font-medium`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\app-drawer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:40:50 AM)**: This component was added as a reusable `AppDrawer`, implementing a fixed-position right-aligned drawer using Tailwind CSS. It handles preventing body scroll when open and includes a header with a title and a close button (`IoClose`).
    *   **Header Styling and Width Adjustments (11/3/2025, 10:41:14 AM - 10:45:56 AM)**: The header's background (`bg-blue-600`) and text color (`text-white`) were removed, followed by the removal of its bottom border (10:42:17 AM). A series of minor changes to the drawer's `width` were logged, indicating testing or iteration on the appropriate size (from `w-135` up to `w-200`, then `w-180`, `w-165`, and finally `w-[42rem]`).
    *   **Reversions and Debugging (11/3/2025, 10:46:15 AM - 10:46:46 AM)**: The drawer width was reverted to `w-165`, the header border was removed again, and the close button's hover state changed back. A temporary "jj" string was added to the drawer's content area for debugging and then removed.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\radio-nav.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:48:23 AM)**: This new component was introduced to provide a radio-button-like navigation, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and `clsx`/`twMerge` for class management. It uses `Field` and `Label` components from a shared `fieldset` kit.
    *   **Minor Correction (11/3/2025, 10:48:30 AM)**: A trailing "ll" from the `Label` component was removed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Tailwind CSS Migration**: The most prominent pattern is the ongoing migration from MUI-based styling to Tailwind CSS across multiple components. This involves replacing MUI components with standard HTML elements and applying Tailwind utility classes.
*   **Component Modularity and Reusability**: New common components like `AppDrawer` and `RadioNav` are being introduced, suggesting an effort to create a consistent, reusable component library, likely part of a broader design system (e.g., `@components/kit`).
*   **Iterative UI/Styling Development**: Numerous small, sequential changes to Tailwind classes (e.g., `width` adjustments in `AppDrawer`, border styles, font styling) indicate an iterative development process for fine-tuning the user interface.
*   **Path Aliases**: Consistent use of path aliases like `@components/common`, `store/api`, `data/coulmns` for imports across files, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code structure.
*   **Debugging Artifacts**: The presence and removal of temporary text ("jj") highlight active development and testing within the components.
