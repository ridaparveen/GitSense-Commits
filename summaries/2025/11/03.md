# Activity Summary for 11/3/2025

## 10:50:05 AM
The provided logs indicate a significant refactoring effort, primarily focusing on migrating UI components and styling from Material-UI (MUI) to Tailwind CSS, alongside general component enhancement and consolidation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11/3/2025, 10:23:42 AM)**: The component `ViewContainer` was using `@mui/material` components for layout (`Box`, `Stack`, `ThemeTabs`). It managed custom dashboard views, allowing users to select up to 9 metrics from "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" categories. It included functionality for saving, updating, deleting, and auditing these views, utilizing RTK Query hooks (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`). Imports were updated to use path aliases, and `ANALYTICS_VIEW_AUDIT_COLUMNS` path was changed.
    *   **Major Refactor (11/3/2025, 10:28:43 AM)**: This was a pivotal change, renaming the component to `ViewContainerTailwind` and commencing a full migration to Tailwind CSS. All `@mui/material` layout components were replaced with standard `div` elements styled with Tailwind classes. The `ThemeTabs` component was replaced by a new `RadioNav` component, and the `tabData` values were updated from generic "1", "2" to descriptive "containerWise", "mblWise". The loading spinner was also replaced with a Tailwind-based animation.
    *   **Subsequent Adjustments (11/3/2025, 10:29:50 AM - 10:40:10 AM)**: Following the Tailwind migration, several iterative changes occurred:
        *   Initial wrapper styling for the main container was removed, and then specific input styling (native `input`) was removed in favor of the custom `InputBox` component (10:32:06 AM, 10:32:52 AM).
        *   The placement of the `RadioNav` relative to the "View Name" input was adjusted (10:31:08 AM).
        *   A `my-6` margin was added to the input section (10:34:28 AM).
        *   Finally, the component was renamed back to `ViewContainer` (10:40:10 AM), indicating the `Tailwind` suffix was temporary during the migration process.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\TreeViewContianer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:35:36 AM)**: This file was introduced to render a tree-like view of metrics with collapsible groups. It uses a custom `Checkbox` component and icons from `@heroicons/react` and `@mui/icons-material`. Styling is entirely based on Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Styling Refinements (11/3/2025, 10:36:01 AM - 10:38:12 AM)**: Minor adjustments were made to the group header button's border styling, including an accidental `b` class which was quickly corrected, and a more specific custom property for the `border-bottom` was applied (10:37:07 AM).
    *   **Label Styling (11/3/2025, 10:47:30 AM - 10:48:45 AM)**: The `span` element displaying the metric name was initially given an `input-title` class, which was then changed to a direct Tailwind class `text-sm font-medium`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\app-drawer.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:40:50 AM)**: This component was added as a reusable `AppDrawer`, implementing a fixed-position right-aligned drawer using Tailwind CSS. It handles preventing body scroll when open and includes a header with a title and a close button (`IoClose`).
    *   **Header Styling and Width Adjustments (11/3/2025, 10:41:14 AM - 10:45:56 AM)**: The header's background (`bg-blue-600`) and text color (`text-white`) were removed, followed by the removal of its bottom border (10:42:17 AM). A series of minor changes to the drawer's `width` were logged, indicating testing or iteration on the appropriate size (from `w-135` up to `w-200`, then `w-180`, `w-165`, and finally `w-[42rem]`).
    *   **Reversions and Debugging (11/3/2025, 10:46:15 AM - 10:46:46 AM)**: The drawer width was reverted to `w-165`, the header border was removed again, and the close button's hover state changed back. A temporary "jj" string was added to the drawer's content area for debugging and then removed.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\radio-nav.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 10:48:23 AM)**: This new component was introduced to provide a radio-button-like navigation, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and `clsx`/`twMerge` for class management. It uses `Field` and `Label` components from a shared `fieldset` kit.
    *   **Minor Correction (11/3/2025, 10:48:30 AM)**: A trailing "ll" from the `Label` component was removed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Tailwind CSS Migration**: The most prominent pattern is the ongoing migration from MUI-based styling to Tailwind CSS across multiple components. This involves replacing MUI components with standard HTML elements and applying Tailwind utility classes.
*   **Component Modularity and Reusability**: New common components like `AppDrawer` and `RadioNav` are being introduced, suggesting an effort to create a consistent, reusable component library, likely part of a broader design system (e.g., `@components/kit`).
*   **Iterative UI/Styling Development**: Numerous small, sequential changes to Tailwind classes (e.g., `width` adjustments in `AppDrawer`, border styles, font styling) indicate an iterative development process for fine-tuning the user interface.
*   **Path Aliases**: Consistent use of path aliases like `@components/common`, `store/api`, `data/coulmns` for imports across files, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code structure.
*   **Debugging Artifacts**: The presence and removal of temporary text ("jj") highlight active development and testing within the components.

## 12:26:12 PM
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on enhancing analytics and reporting functionalities within a backend system. The updates span several service files and the main analytics routing configuration, showing iterative development, debugging, and refactoring.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM)**: This file defined `getExportData` for generating analytics exports, distinguishing between booking and non-booking reports. It included a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" in data and implemented specific `DISTINCT ON` clauses for MBL-wise reports and a TEU filter for non-booking reports.
    *   **Intermediate Edits (11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM & 11:52:44 AM)**: These timestamps reveal a period of code instability, marked by significant duplication of interfaces and helper functions, temporary import path changes for the database utility (`@src/common/db` vs `@src/common/util/database`), and introduction of syntax errors (`co logger.error`). This suggests a complex merge or copy-paste operation.
    *   **Refactoring & Cleanup (11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM & 11:56:23 AM)**: The subsequent changes focused on resolving the duplication, correcting syntax errors, and consolidating interface definitions. `NextFunction` was properly imported, query parameter access was explicitly typed, and debugging `console.log` statements were added (e.g., `===request12345===>`, `===userCode===>`, `===mainQuery===>`). The MBL-wise TEU filter was updated with explicit type annotations for `obj` and `item`. The `query` import was stabilized to `@src/common/util/database`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Query Definition (11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM)**: This file defines `getMonthValue` and `bookingQuery`. The `bookingQuery` function dynamically generates complex SQL snippets for various booking reports, including detailed `CASE WHEN` logic to categorize day differences into weekly buckets for stacked bar visualizations. A new filter `m.t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date IS NOT NULL` was added to the "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)" query.
    *   **No Functional Change (11/3/2025, 11:58:42 AM)**: The code content remained identical to the previous timestamp, likely a minor save operation.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **Query Builder Introduction (11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM)**: This file introduced `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function designed to construct specific SQL queries for different booking-related analytics, such as "Booking Date to Actual Departure" and its MBL-wise and stacked bar variants. It utilizes `WITH` clauses for aggregation and calculates percentages. It also updates a `customizer` object with report-specific metadata.
    *   **No Functional Change (11/3/2025, 12:16:05 PM)**: The code content remained identical to the previous timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **Centralized Reporting (11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM)**: The `getTableDataReports` function was introduced as a central dispatcher for various analytics reports. It integrates multiple query builders (chassis, booking, container, departure, general) and selects the appropriate one based on the `type` parameter in the request. It also includes debugging output for the generated SQL queries.
    *   **Minor Debugging (11/3/2025, 12:08:25 PM)**: A `console.log(error)` was added within the catch block, alongside the existing `logger.info(error)`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **Container Reporting (11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM)**: The `getContainerReports` function was added to generate reports based on container data, allowing grouping by columns like `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`, or `trucker`. It constructs dynamic SQL queries with `DISTINCT ON` clauses and applies a special condition for trucker-based TEU reports.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM)**: This update introduced explicit interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) for better type safety and code clarity. Variable access for `companyname` and `access` was streamlined. Comments were added to enhance readability, and a minor typo (`ConditionForTueByTrucker` to `ConditionForTeuByTrucker`) was corrected.
    *   **Minor Debugging (11/3/2025, 12:16:36 PM)**: A `console.log("===reqquery",req.query);` was added at the start of the `getContainerReports` function for debugging purposes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **New Routes (11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM)**: This file was updated to register new GET endpoints for various analytics reports, including TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and general Table Data, linking them to their respective service functions (e.g., `getTEUReports`, `getContainerReports`, `getTableDataReports`). A duplicate route definition for `Paths.Analytics.Get` was observed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Date Handling**: A `defaultDateRange()` utility is frequently used across services to provide fallback `fromDate` and `toDate` values, ensuring reports always have a defined time window.
*   **User Context and Authorization**: `getUserObject` is consistently invoked across multiple services to extract `companyname` and `usercode` from the authenticated request, facilitating company-specific data filtering and access control.
*   **Modular Query Generation**: The system employs a modular approach with dedicated query builder functions (e.g., `bookingQueryBuilder`, `chassisQueryBuilder`) for different categories of reports. These builders dynamically construct SQL queries based on request parameters.
*   **`DISTINCT ON` for Uniqueness**: Many SQL queries, particularly those involving containers, utilize the `DISTINCT ON (m.voyage, m.contno, ...)` clause to prevent duplicate entries, ensuring accurate counts and calculations. For MBL-wise reports, this logic adapts to the `mblno`.
*   **Standardized Data Transformation**: The `replaceColumnHandler` function demonstrates a pattern of normalizing specific data values (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES") for consistency across reports.
*   **Debugging and Logging**: Throughout the changes, `console.log` and `logger.info` statements are extensively used to track request parameters, intermediate values, and generated SQL queries, indicating an active debugging and development process.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: All service functions consistently wrap their logic in `try-catch` blocks, logging errors and returning a standard `500 Internal Server Error` response, ensuring system stability.
*   **Type Safety Improvement**: The introduction of specific interfaces (e.g., `ContainerReportQuery`) in refactored code indicates a push towards improving type safety and code maintainability.
*   **API Expansion**: The `analyticsRoutes.ts` updates show a clear pattern of adding new API endpoints to expose the growing set of analytics reports.

## 1:26:12 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining analytics and reporting functionalities across several service files and query utilities, with a strong emphasis on dynamic SQL generation, data processing, and type safety improvements.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM - 11:52:09 AM**: Initial or minor saves of the `getExportData` controller, which handles exporting data for booking and non-booking reports. It includes logic for date range defaults, user/company object retrieval, column selection, and a `replaceColumnHandler` function to normalize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES". A specific filter for MBL-wise TEU reports is also present.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM - 11:52:44 AM**: Introduced temporary code inconsistencies, including duplicated `Response` imports, adding `NextFunction` (which wasn't used), and changing the `query` utility import path (to `@src/common/db` from `@src/common/util/database`), which was later reverted. There were also duplicated `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface definitions and a typo (`co logger.error`) in the catch block that was corrected to `console.log("error", error)`.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM**: The `query` import was temporarily removed, `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface was simplified by removing `companyname` and `access` (despite still being used in the code), and numerous `console.log` statements were added for debugging request parameters, user codes, main queries, and exported data. The `getUserObject` call was made more explicit in casting query parameters.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:56:23 AM**: The `query` utility import path was correctly restored to `@src/common/util/database`, and `nonBookingQuery` was re-imported, resolving previous issues. The `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface still omits `companyname` and `access` fields, indicating a type safety gap, but the debugging logs and previous functional changes remained.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM - 11:58:42 AM**: Defines `getMonthValue` and `bookingQuery` functions. `bookingQuery` generates complex SQL WHERE clauses and SELECT components for various booking reports, including stacked bar chart variations, incorporating dynamic filtering based on month, week, or quarter. It extensively uses `DISTINCT ON` for container/MBL uniqueness and `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)` for date differences.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM - 1:18:17 PM**: Implements `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function responsible for constructing full SQL queries for numerous booking-related analytics, including "Booking Date to Actual Departure" and its MBL-wise and stacked bar variants. These queries involve CTEs (`WITH t AS`), aggregation (AVG, COUNT), date difference calculations, and dynamic column selection using `getColumnsByCategory` and date filtering via `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`.
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:57 PM - 1:23:26 PM**: Introduced type safety improvements by defining `Customizer` and refining the `reportName` type in the `QueryBuilderI` interface, initially allowing `string[]` and later restricting it to `string | undefined`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM - 12:08:25 PM**: The `getTableDataReports` function orchestrates analytics reports by delegating query building to specialized builder functions (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`) based on the requested report `type`. It handles default date ranges, retrieves user/company context, and includes extensive `if/else if` conditions for report type routing. A `console.log(error)` was added to the catch block in the later timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM**: The `getContainerReports` function constructs SQL queries for container reports, dynamically grouping data by columns like `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`, or `trucker`. It uses `replaceValueInQuery` for data normalization and specific conditions for trucker-related data (`type_of_move IN ('FDC','FDN')`).
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM**: Significant type safety enhancements were made by introducing `ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, and `AnalyticsRow` interfaces. Query parameter handling was refactored, and explicit typing was applied to `user_id` and `reportName` for `getColumnsByCategory`. SQL query sections were also commented for improved readability.
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:16:36 PM**: A `console.log("===reqquery", req.query);` was added for debugging purposes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM**: This file saw a significant expansion of analytics routes. New GET endpoints were added for various report types, including TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and general Table Data, each mapping to its respective service function (e.g., `getTEUReports`, `getCBMReports`, `getContainerReports`, `getTransitReports`, `getTableDataReports`).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM**: This utility file underwent several improvements. Commented-out code was removed, and interfaces like `UserRow` were introduced for clarity. The `getUserObject` function's return type was made explicit. `getExcelSelectedColumns` logic was refined, especially for the "BL Release KPI" report, and the base columns for export were expanded significantly. The `dateFilterOnExport` function was updated to use `moment.format("MM/DD/YYYY")` for consistent date formatting. Finally, the `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array was considerably extended with many new key-name mappings, indicating a broader range of data available for export.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Date Range Management:** A consistent `defaultDateRange()` utility is used to set a 365-day range when `fromDate` or `toDate` are not provided in requests across multiple services.
*   **User and Company Context:** The `getUserObject` helper is frequently invoked to establish the `CompanyName` and `userCode` for current operations, critical for data filtering in a multi-tenant environment.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation:** A pervasive pattern is the construction of SQL queries dynamically based on report parameters, column choices, and date ranges. This is evident in `export.query.ts`, `booking.query.ts`, `containerService.ts`, and `analyticsExportService.ts`.
*   **Data Normalization:** The need to replace "LONG BEACH" with "LOS ANGELES" is a recurring theme, handled both as a post-processing step in `analyticsExportService.ts` and directly within SQL queries using `replaceValueInQuery` in `containerService.ts`.
*   **Modularity in Query Builders:** The `tableService.ts` demonstrates a clear architectural pattern of delegating specific report query logic to dedicated builder functions (`chassis.query`, `booking.query`, `container.query`, `departure.query`, `general.query`), enhancing organization and maintainability.
*   **Type Safety Evolution:** There is a visible trend toward improving code clarity and robustness through the introduction and refinement of TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `AnalyticsControllerQuery`, `ContainerReportQuery`, `QueryBuilderI`, `Customizer`) across several files.
*   **Extensive Logging:** `logger.info` and `logger.error` are consistently used for operational logging, and `console.log` statements were frequently added during development for debugging, especially in `analyticsExportService.ts` and `containerService.ts`.
*   **SQL Query Structure:** Common SQL constructs include `DISTINCT ON (...)` for unique record selection, `EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)` for date calculations, and `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END` for conditional logic and data categorization.
*   **Data Export Expansion:** The `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array in `analytics.ts` shows a significant increase in available exportable columns, suggesting a major enhancement to the reporting capabilities.

## 1:26:36 PM
The changes primarily focus on enhancing the analytics section of a frontend application, specifically concerning report configuration, data processing, chart rendering, and Excel export functionalities. All modifications occurred on November 3, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\config\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:04:01 PM & 12:04:54 PM**
    *   This file defines comprehensive analytics configurations.
    *   `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS` outlines various CBM and TEU reports grouped by dimensions like ocean freight carrier, port, supplier, and country.
    *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` lists an extensive set of columns for Excel exports, covering detailed shipment information from file numbers and account names to container specifics and various date milestones (original/live ETD, ETA, discharge, availability, delivery, return).
    *   `CargoReadyToETD10Days` defines a smaller set of columns for a specific report focusing on cargo readiness and ETD.
    *   `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` provides headers for a wide array of reports, including Container Wise (CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit) and MBL Wise (CBM, TEU, KGS, Transit) metrics, as well as several new Chassis and Container lifecycle reports such as "Chassis Pick-Up Date vs Final Delivery", "Average Days Chassis Used", "Container Discharge vs Availability", and "Containers Outgated but Not Returned". The second timestamp for this file shows no content change, indicating a save operation without modification.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:06:05 PM**
    *   Introduced robust TypeScript type definitions (`AnalyticsData`, `Customizer`, `Metric`, `Endpoint`, `FormatSettings`, `MetricsPackageReturn`) for various analytics-related data structures, significantly improving type safety.
    *   The `metricsPackageHandler` function was converted to be strongly typed, responsible for processing raw analytics data into a structured object for UI consumption, including determining chart types and calculation methods (e.g., total, average).
    *   Added `reportFormula` for dynamically generating formula strings for reports like "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" based on date columns.
    *   Implemented `weekDateFormater` for consistent date formatting.
    *   The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function was added, capable of generating Excel reports using `ExcelJS`. This function handles dynamic header adjustments based on period filters and chart types (especially for "StackedBar" and "transitBar"). It includes specific logic for data mapping and calculation summaries (Average, Total) for various stacked bar reports like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD" and "BL Release KPI".
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:37:19 PM**
    *   No visible changes in code content from the previous timestamp, indicating a save operation.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:38:24 PM**
    *   Extended the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function to include export logic for a new report: `"Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)"`, handling data mapping for "This Quarter" and "Last Quarter" based on period filters.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\StackedBarChart.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:24:18 PM**
    *   Initial implementation of the `StackedBarChart` component using `ReactApexChart`. It configures a horizontal stacked bar chart with dynamic Y-axis categories based on period filters (month, week, quarter) and a tooltip that displays values as both absolute numbers and percentages. Basic styling and a loading state were included.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:25:35 PM**
    *   A `color="red"` attribute was temporarily added to the `Tooltip` component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:25:59 PM**
    *   The temporary `Tooltip` color attribute was removed, and "kk" was briefly added to the displayed report name (likely for debugging).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:26:13 PM**
    *   The "kk" debugging text was removed, reverting the component's title display to the original report name.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:29:16 PM**
    *   **Major Refinement:** The component was refactored with comprehensive TypeScript type definitions (`ChartDataItem`, `ChartProps`), converted to a `React.FC`, and incorporated Tailwind CSS classes for styling, replacing inline styles. Chart `colors` were updated for better visual distinction (`["#09090B", "#E5E5E5"]`), legend labels were explicitly colored black, and tooltip styling was improved. Data processing in `useEffect` was made more robust by ensuring numeric values for chart series.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:30:37 PM**
    *   The chart `colors` array was slightly adjusted from `["#09090B", "#E5E5E5"]` to `["#09090B", "#71717A"]` (a darker gray).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:31:43 PM**
    *   No visible changes in code content from the previous timestamp.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:32:13 PM**
    *   The "kk" debugging text was again temporarily added to the displayed report name.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:33:02 PM**
    *   The "kk" debugging text was removed. Styling for the chart title `div` was simplified by removing explicit `text-align`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, and `color` styles, relying more on inherited or surrounding Tailwind classes.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:33:10 PM**
    *   The title styling was reverted to use the more explicit Tailwind classes: `text-center text-gray-800 font-semibold text-base truncate w-[90%] mx-auto`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 12:40:45 PM**
    *   This component manages the overall analytics dashboard layout and interactions.
    *   It uses `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to reorder (`moveItem`) and resize (`saveSize`) metric widgets, with changes persisted via API calls (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`).
    *   Redux is integrated (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management of metrics and settings.
    *   Introduced TypeScript types (`UserType`, `MetricItem`) for user data and metric items.
    *   `fetchSingleReport` function handles fetching individual report data from an API (`useLazyFetchReportQuery`), applying various filters, and processing the response using `metricsPackageHandler` before updating the Redux store.
    *   The component renders a grid (`id="metric-board"`, `grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-4`) composed of `ResizableGridItem`s, each housing a `MetricsBox`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics Dashboard Development:** The changes consistently focus on building and refining an analytics dashboard, covering data definitions, processing logic, chart visualization, and interactive UI elements.
*   **Timestamp Clustering:** All changes occurred on a single date (11/3/2025), indicating a concentrated development effort on these analytics features.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** There is a clear and strong pattern of introducing and expanding TypeScript typing across multiple files, significantly improving code quality, maintainability, and error detection.
*   **Modularity and Component-Based Architecture:** The code is organized into distinct files for configuration, utility methods, and specific chart components, adhering to a component-based frontend architecture.
*   **Interactive UI:** Features like drag-and-drop, resizing, and dynamic data filtering highlight a focus on creating a highly interactive and customizable user experience for analytics.
*   **Excel Export Capability:** The integration of `ExcelJS` for spreadsheet generation across multiple report types demonstrates a recurring requirement for data export functionality.
*   **Iterative Chart Development:** The `StackedBarChart.tsx` file specifically shows an iterative development process, with minor adjustments, debugging steps (like "kk" placeholders), and significant refactoring for type safety and modern styling, followed by further minor refinements.
*   **Consistent Styling Approach:** A shift from inline styles to Tailwind CSS classes is evident in `StackedBarChart.tsx`, suggesting a broader pattern for consistent styling across the application.

## 2:26:15 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining and extending the analytics and reporting functionality within the backend system. This includes improvements to data querying, export mechanisms, and report generation, with a strong emphasis on type safety and dynamic SQL construction.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM - 11:52:09 AM**: The initial state of the `getExportData` controller processes booking and non-booking reports, applies a `replaceColumnHandler` for port name consistency (Long Beach to Los Angeles), and includes a specific MBLwise TEU filter. It uses various utility functions for date range, column queries, user object retrieval, and database interaction.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM - 11:52:44 AM**: This period introduced temporary issues, including duplicate imports and interface declarations, a typo (`co logger.error`), and a change in the database `query` import path from `@src/common/util/database` to `@src/common/db`. These commits appear to be transitional, with some debugging (`console.log("error",error)`) being added.
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM - 11:56:23 AM**: A significant cleanup and refactoring occurred. Duplicate code was removed, the `query` import path was reverted to `@src/common/util/database`, and the `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface was streamlined by removing `companyname` and `access` as direct properties, instead passing them explicitly to the `getUserObject` utility. Additional `console.log` statements were added for debugging query generation and user code. The MBLwise TEU filter logic was slightly adjusted to use a generic `obj` for tracking seen items.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM - 11:58:42 AM**: This file, introduced or first logged during this period, defines `getMonthValue` and a comprehensive `bookingQuery` function. `bookingQuery` contains a large map of SQL query fragments for various booking-related reports, including "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to Estimated Departure", and "Booking Date to POD Arrival", with specific logic for "Stacked Bar" and "MBL Wise" variations. Queries frequently check for `NOT NULL` and exclude `'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'` dates.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM - 1:18:17 PM**: This file defines `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function responsible for constructing SQL queries and customizing report metadata (like date ranges, calculation types, and selected columns) for various booking-related analytics. It dynamically generates queries for reports such as "BookingDatetoActualDeparture" and its MBL-wise and stacked bar variants.
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:57 PM - 1:29:32 PM**: A series of type-safety improvements were made. The `QueryBuilderI` interface was updated, and dedicated `Customizer`, `CalColumn`, and `CalColumnConfig` interfaces were introduced and progressively refined to explicitly define the structure of the `customizer` object, enhancing code clarity and maintainability. This included adding properties like `mblwise` and `chartType` to the `Customizer` interface.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM - 12:08:25 PM**: The `getTableDataReports` controller was updated to handle a wide array of analytics report types (chassis, booking/cargo-ready, containers, departures, general). It acts as a router, dispatching to different `queryBuilder` functions based on the `type` parameter from the request. It consistently retrieves user and company information and logs the generated SQL query for debugging, adding `console.log(error)` for catch block in the latter timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM**: The `getContainerReports` controller dynamically constructs SQL queries for container-specific analytics, allowing grouping by columns like `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`, or `trucker`. It includes logic for `DISTINCT ON` container tracking and uses `replaceValueInQuery` for data standardization.
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM - 12:16:36 PM**: This file underwent significant refactoring for improved type safety and readability. Explicit interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) were introduced. The logic for user/company retrieval was streamlined, and the `query` function was updated to use a generic type. A minor debugging `console.log("===reqquery",req.query)` was added.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM**: This route file was extended to include new endpoints for various analytics reports, specifically for TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and general Table Data, integrating the newly developed service functions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM**: This utility file was enhanced with several helper functions: `defaultDateRange` for consistent date defaults, `replaceValueInQuery` for standardizing column values (e.g., port names), `getUserObject` for managing user and company context (including ADMIN access logic), `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` for dynamic SQL grouping/ordering based on display preferences (month, week, quarter), `getExcelSelectedColumns` to select relevant columns for report exports, and `dateFilterOnExport` to clean and format date fields in export data. It also defines a comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dynamic SQL Query Generation:** A prominent pattern is the dynamic construction of complex SQL queries using template literals, which vary based on report type, filters, and display options. This is evident in `analyticsExportService`, `export.query`, `booking.query`, `tableService`, and `containerService`.
*   **Date Normalization:** Dates are consistently handled with default ranges (`defaultDateRange`), formatted for SQL queries (`'${date}'::timestamp`), and validated/formatted for export (`dateFilterOnExport`). Invalid dates (e.g., `'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'`) are explicitly filtered out in SQL queries.
*   **User and Company Context:** The `getUserObject` utility is central to retrieving and managing user and company information, often passed to query builders to scope data.
*   **Data Standardization:** The conversion of "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" is implemented both in `replaceColumnHandler` within a service and via `replaceValueInQuery` utility, highlighting a need for consistent data representation.
*   **Type Safety and Refactoring:** Later commits, particularly in `booking.query.ts` and `containerService.ts`, show a clear trend towards introducing and refining TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `Customizer`, `QueryBuilderI`) to improve type safety, code structure, and maintainability.
*   **Reporting Diversity:** The system supports a wide range of analytics reports, categorized by subject (booking, containers, chassis, departures, general) and presentation (simple data, MBL-wise, stacked bar charts, Excel exports).
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent use of `console.log` and `logger.info` statements throughout the code suggests active development and debugging, with some debugging lines being temporary.

## 2:26:48 PM
The code changes, primarily occurring on November 3, 2025, between 12:00 PM and 2:30 PM, are focused on enhancing the analytics dashboard functionality within the `t360-frontend-v2` project. Key updates span across configuration, utility methods, and various React components responsible for rendering and interacting with analytics charts and reports.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`src\config\analytics.ts`** (11/3/2025, 12:04:01 PM & 12:04:54 PM): This file defines various analytics report configurations, including `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`, `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`, `CargoReadyToETD10Days`, and `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER`. No significant content changes were observed between the two timestamps, indicating a stable configuration for report structures and data columns.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\methods.ts`** (11/3/2025, 12:06:05 PM, 12:37:19 PM, & 12:38:24 PM): This file contains utility functions for analytics. The primary change at 12:38:24 PM was an expansion of the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function to handle a new report type, "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)", specifically for "StackedBar" charts across different time periods (month, week, quarter), indicating extended data export capabilities. Type definitions for input parameters and return types were also introduced for improved code quality.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\StackedBarChart.tsx`** (Numerous timestamps from 11/3/2025, 12:24:18 PM to 2:02:37 PM): This component underwent extensive iterative development.
    *   Early changes focused on integrating TypeScript interfaces and defining chart options like colors (`["#09090B", "#E5E5E5"]` then `["#09090B", "#71717A"]`).
    *   Subsequent updates refined chart styling, particularly for tooltips. Initially using default ApexCharts tooltip formatters, there was a shift towards custom HTML tooltips (at 1:51:15 PM, 1:53:13 PM, and 2:01:47 PM) to achieve a consistent white background, gray border, and black text, along with displaying value and percentage.
    *   Styling for chart title (truncation, font-weight, color) and loading states also saw adjustments.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 12:40:45 PM & 2:11:51 PM): This core component manages the analytics grid, handling metric reordering, resizing, and data fetching. The main changes involved explicitly defining TypeScript types for user data (`UserType`) and metric items (`MetricItem`), and specifying Redux state types (`RootState`, `AppDispatch`) for `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`** (Numerous timestamps from 11/3/2025, 1:31:55 PM to 1:35:29 PM): This component renders individual metric boxes. It saw iterative updates similar to `StackedBarChart.tsx` regarding TypeScript type definitions for props and state. There was a back-and-forth on strict Redux state typing (`state.analytics` vs `state.analyticSlice`) and component inclusion (`MetricToolbar` within `ThemedModal`).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:39:15 PM, 1:39:26 PM, & 1:42:37 PM): This component provides filtering and chart view options. A `RadioNav` component for chart type selection (bar, pie, line) was introduced and then commented out, suggesting an experimental feature that was reverted. The `SwitchBox` component remained the primary chart type selector.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\SwitchBox.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:42:09 PM & 1:43:37 PM): A reusable chart type selector component. No notable content changes were observed, focusing on consistent styling and functionality.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\PieChart.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:45:10 PM & 1:45:37 PM): Introduced a `Tooltip` component for the chart title and fixed a color string in the legend.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\LineChart.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 1:47:50 PM & 1:47:56 PM): Added a `Tooltip` component for the chart title.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\PdfRenderer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:03:39 PM to 2:06:08 PM): This component prepares content for PDF export. It was updated to include a company logo (`logo-v2.svg`), enhance title styling with truncation, and improve robustness by adding nullish coalescing operators for client name and date range display.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`** (Numerous timestamps from 11/3/2025, 2:07:36 PM to 2:21:06 PM): Manages export options (Excel, PDF) and full-screen view.
    *   The PDF export functionality was a major focus, migrating from simple icon buttons to a more complex flow involving `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for rendering chart components within a hidden DOM element before generating the PDF. This also involved iterative changes to ensure the correct styling and loading indicators.
    *   A significant revert at 2:10:32 PM temporarily switched back to MUI `Button`/`Chip` components from custom Tailwind-styled ones and changed Redux state access, but this was mostly undone in subsequent commits (2:12:00 PM, 2:12:06 PM, 2:12:20 PM), restoring the previous state management and component usage.
    *   At 2:15:20 PM, `html2canvas` options were updated to explicitly set `backgroundColor: "#ffffff"` for PDF generation, likely to address issues with transparent or modern CSS color formats (e.g., `oklch`). This was then reverted and re-reverted.
    *   Final adjustments involved explicit inline styling for PDF icons.
*   **`src\index.css`** (11/3/2025, 2:17:41 PM & 2:17:53 PM): The global CSS file. At 2:17:53 PM, new color variables (`--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-danger`) were added to the `@theme` block, utilizing the `oklch` color format, signifying an expansion of the application's design system.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:22:07 PM & 2:23:38 PM): Manages custom dashboard creation and editing. The change at 2:23:38 PM simplified the `Loader` component usage, removing a specific `screen="modal"` prop.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:24:22 PM): The main analytics toolbar. The `downloadDashboardPDF` function was significantly refactored to use `Image` and `getBase64Image` for robust logo rendering in PDFs, explicitly handling image loading and potential issues with `html2canvas` for local assets. Older, less stable PDF export code was commented out.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Development on Analytics:** All changes are concentrated within the analytics feature, suggesting active development or bug fixing for this module.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** A consistent effort is observed to introduce and refine TypeScript interfaces and explicit typing across components and utility functions, enhancing code maintainability and error checking.
*   **Charting and Reporting Enhancements:** There's a strong focus on improving the visual presentation and export functionality of charts, particularly stacked bar charts, including detailed tooltip customization and robust PDF export.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Many files show multiple commits within minutes, indicating a highly iterative development process with frequent small adjustments, debugging (often using `console.log`), and experimentation with styling and component behavior.
*   **Redux State Management:** Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) is consistently used for managing application state across different analytics components.
*   **PDF Export Complexity:** The PDF export feature seems to be a complex area, undergoing several revisions to handle image rendering, styling, and general stability across different chart types. The use of `html2canvas` (and `html2canvas-pro`) and `jsPDF` is central to this.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Efforts were made to standardize styling, including explicit color definitions (e.g., black and gray palettes for charts, text colors, tooltip backgrounds) and usage of Tailwind CSS classes and MUI components.

## 3:26:20 PM
The log details changes across three files, primarily focusing on UI updates, state management, and PDF/Excel export functionalities within an analytics dashboard application.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`** (Frequent changes between 11/3/2025, 2:08:09 PM and 2:21:06 PM):
    *   **Initial State (2:08:09 PM):** This component handles the footer for individual metric cards, providing functionalities like Excel/PDF export, and enlarging charts. It uses Material-UI icons (`FileDownloadOutlined`, `FullscreenOutlined`, `InfoOutlined`), `react-icons/fa6` (`FaFileExcel`, `FaFilePdf`), and `react-icons/md` (`MdPictureAsPdf`). Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) is used for state management. PDF generation relies on `jspdf` and `html2canvas`.
    *   **2:09:05 PM:** A minor change occurred, likely a formatting or whitespace adjustment, as the code content appears identical to the previous version.
    *   **2:10:32 PM:** Significant refactoring.
        *   Replaced `react-icons` for Excel/PDF with Material-UI icons (`TableViewOutlined`, `PictureAsPdfOutlined`).
        *   Changed the styling and structure of export buttons from `IconButton` with `FaFileExcel`/`MdPictureAsPdf` to `Button` components from `@mui/material`.
        *   Updated Redux state access from `state.analyticSlice` to `state.analytics` and user data from `localStorage` to `state.auth.user`.
        *   Removed `FaFilePdf` and `MdPictureAsPdf` imports.
        *   Added `EXPORT_ITEMS` array, suggesting a menu-based export option, though it's commented out in subsequent logs.
        *   Modified the `handlePdf` function to potentially clone the chart component with an `exportPdf: true` prop, suggesting a specific rendering for PDF.
    *   **2:11:01 PM:** Minor change, commenting out `import TMenu from '../../common/TMenu';`.
    *   **2:12:00 PM:** Reverted Redux state access for `toolState` from `state.analytics` back to `state.analyticSlice` and user from `state.auth.user` back to `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user") || "{}")`. Added `RootState` type import.
    *   **2:12:06 PM & 2:12:20 PM:** Further minor adjustments, mainly commenting out `ViewFiled` import. The PDF export function also saw a brief change (2:15:20 PM) to add `useCORS: true, backgroundColor: "#ffffff"` to `html2canvas` options, which was then reverted by 2:15:52 PM.
    *   **2:17:19 PM:** Changed the inline `className` for `MdPictureAsPdf` to an inline `style` object: `style={{ color: "#6b7280", fontSize: "1.2rem" }}`.
    *   **2:21:00 PM & 2:21:06 PM:** Removed `FileDownloadOutlined`, `FaFilePdf`, and `Stack` imports, while retaining `CircularProgress` and `Tooltip` directly from `@mui/material`. The PDF icon styling was reverted to use `className="text-gray-500"` in 2:21:00 PM, then back to inline style in 2:21:06 PM.

2.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`** (11/3/2025, 2:11:51 PM):
    *   This file defines the main analytics container, handling drag-and-drop (`DndProvider`, `HTML5Backend`), metric resizing, view changes, and data fetching.
    *   Introduced TypeScript interfaces for `UserType` and `MetricItem` for better type safety.
    *   Updated Redux state access to `state.analyticSlice` and `state.settingSlice`.
    *   Added `AppDispatch` type for `useDispatch`.
    *   Updated `saveSequence` and `saveMetricSize` mutation calls to use `.unwrap()` for better error handling.
    *   The core logic for moving, resizing, and saving views remains consistent.

3.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`** (Multiple changes between 11/3/2025, 2:22:07 PM and 2:38:33 PM):
    *   **Initial State (2:22:07 PM):** Manages the creation, editing, and deletion of custom analytics dashboards ("views"). It uses `react-hot-toast` for notifications, `RadioNav` for tab selection, and `InputBox` for naming views. It interacts with an analytics API for fetching and saving dashboard options and also includes an audit drawer.
    *   **2:23:38 PM:** Removed a specific `screen="modal"` prop from the `Loader` component.
    *   **2:30:10 PM:** Added a `console.log("===virwtitle==",viewTitle);` for debugging.
    *   **2:31:47 PM:** Introduced comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for `ViewContainerProps`, `ViewOptionItem`, `ViewOptions`, `CheckBoxManager`, `AlertConfig`, and `ModalState`, significantly improving type safety and code readability. Refined the `handleCheckBoxClicked` logic for better state updates and error handling, and added `try-catch` blocks to `handleSave` and `handleDelete` for robust error management and toast notifications.
    *   **2:32:35 PM & 2:33:11 PM:** Added more `console.log` statements (`===view,`, `viewname`) for debugging the `viewTitle` and `viewName` state.
    *   **2:33:50 PM, 2:34:02 PM, 2:36:17 PM, 2:36:39 PM:** The initialization of `viewName` state was changed from `viewTitle || ""` to `{viewTitle}` or simply `viewTitle`. This was then corrected in 2:38:19 PM by introducing a `useEffect` to set `viewName` from `viewTitle` when `action` is "edit".
    *   **2:38:19 PM:** Corrected `viewName` initialization logic to ensure it's properly set from `viewTitle` when `action` is "edit" via a `useEffect` hook.
    *   **2:38:33 PM:** Reverted the `viewName` initialization in `useState` back to `viewTitle || ""` while keeping the `useEffect` for `action === "edit"`.

4.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`** (Multiple changes between 11/3/2025, 2:24:22 PM and 3:25:47 PM):
    *   This component provides the toolbar for the analytics dashboard, including date filters, dashboard selection, and global PDF export.
    *   **2:24:22 PM:** Implemented a `downloadDashboardPDF` function using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`. This function captures the `#metric-board` element, resizes it, adds a logo, and saves it as a PDF. Several commented-out alternative `downloadDashboardPDF` implementations are present, suggesting iterative development or experimentation with PDF export methods. Imports of various icons from `@mui/icons-material`, `react-icons/bs`, `react-icons/fa6`, and `@heroicons/react` are extensive.
    *   **2:28:32 PM, 2:29:15 PM, 2:29:36 PM, 3:05:04 PM, 3:05:37 PM, 3:21:27 PM, 3:21:40 PM, 3:22:02 PM, 3:22:18 PM, 3:23:44 PM, 3:24:20 PM, 3:24:59 PM, 3:25:07 PM, 3:25:33 PM, 3:25:47 PM:** These timestamps primarily show minor adjustments related to importing icons (e.g., `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, `PlusIcon`, `PresentationChartLineIcon`, `HiPresentationChartLine`) and commenting/uncommenting sections of the JSX, particularly related to the `Stack` components and a global PDF export button, indicating ongoing UI refinement.

5.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\index.css`** (Changes between 11/3/2025, 2:17:41 PM and 2:17:53 PM):
    *   **2:17:41 PM:** Defines global CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, breakpoints, text properties, and shadows within a `@theme` block. It also includes utility classes and custom styles for MUI DataGrid scrollbars.
    *   **2:17:53 PM:** Added new color variables `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, and `--color-danger` using the `oklch` color function, indicating a new set of semantic colors for the theme.

6.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`** (Multiple changes between 11/3/2025, 2:43:19 PM and 3:18:40 PM):
    *   This component provides a scrollable chip-based tab view with left/right navigation.
    *   **2:43:19 PM:** Initial version, using basic Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Scroll buttons use `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` icons.
    *   **2:47:32 PM:** Minor whitespace change.
    *   **2:50:09 PM:** Added `msOverflowStyle: "none"` and `scrollbarWidth: "none"` for cross-browser scrollbar hiding, and an inline `<style>` tag to hide `webkit-scrollbar`. Changed `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` `size` prop to `fontSize="small"`.
    *   **2:53:12 PM:** Refactored button styling. Changed from `px-4 py-1.5 rounded-full` to `px-4 py-2 border rounded-full` for options, and `px-4 py-1.5 rounded-full border border-gray-300` to `flex items-center justify-between gap-2 px-4 py-2 rounded-full border` for the button chip. Added `transition-all duration-200` for smoother hover effects. Adjusted gap from `gap-2` to `gap-3`.
    *   **2:53:23 PM, 2:54:13 PM, 2:55:02 PM, 2:55:22 PM, 2:55:38 PM, 2:55:49 PM:** Reverted most of the styling changes from 2:53:12 PM, going back to simpler chip button styles, but maintaining the `w-[180px] h-[40px]` dimensions, `shadow` classes, and `transition hover:bg-gray-50` for the optional button chip.
    *   **2:57:06 PM:** Swapped the order of the optional button chip and the options map within the scrollable container.
    *   **2:58:24 PM:** Updated chip styling again: `w-[180px] h-[40px]` changed to `w-[220px] min-w-[200px] h-[44px]` for both regular options and the button chip. The active state `bg-blue-600 text-white border-blue-600` was changed to `bg-gray-100 text-black hover:bg-gray-100`. Removed `border` from the option buttons.
    *   **3:01:42 PM:** Removed `max-w-[520px]` from the main container, making it potentially wider.
    *   **3:01:58 PM, 3:02:07 PM, 3:02:19 PM, 3:02:28 PM, 3:02:44 PM, 3:03:06 PM, 3:04:48 PM, 3:05:58 PM, 3:06:08 PM, 3:06:31 PM, 3:06:48 PM, 3:07:07 PM, 3:07:21 PM, 3:08:24 PM:** Repeated adjustments to the `max-w` property of the main container, ranging from `w-full` to specific pixel values like `max-w-[520px]`, `max-w-[550px]`, `max-w-[700px]`, `max-w-[1200px]`, `max-w-[800px]`, `w-[180px]`, `max-w-[900px]`, `max-w-[1000px]`, `max-w-[1100px]`. Also, subtle changes to spacing and icon alignment (e.g., `ml-4` for icon margin) for the button chip.
    *   **3:09:50 PM:** Significant styling revamp:
        *   Changed `rounded-lg` to `rounded-xl` for the button chip.
        *   Changed `shadow-[0_4px_6px_-1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0_2px_4px_-2px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]` to `shadow-[0_1px_3px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]` for a lighter shadow.
        *   Adjusted hover states and active state colors for tabs (`bg-gray-100 border-gray-400 text-gray-900`).
        *   Added `icon?: React.ReactNode;` to the `Option` interface, indicating that regular options might now also display icons.
    *   **3:10:27 PM, 3:10:37 PM, 3:11:06 PM, 3:12:19 PM, 3:12:33 PM, 3:12:51 PM, 3:13:08 PM, 3:13:36 PM, 3:13:42 PM, 3:13:55 PM, 3:14:03 PM, 3:14:14 PM, 3:16:11 PM, 3:17:04 PM, 3:17:37 PM, 3:17:57 PM, 3:18:18 PM, 3:18:40 PM:** Further iterations on styles, including minor adjustments to `max-w` (e.g., `max-w-[950px]`), `rounded-xl` to `rounded-md`, and varying the `fontSize` of the scroll `Chevron` icons (small, medium, large) before settling back on `large`. The active state background for tab options also shifted from `bg-gray-100` to `bg-[var(--Background-backgroundHoverOverlay,#00000006)]` in one instance (3:12:19 PM) and then back to `bg-gray-100`. The shadow on options was changed back to `shadow-[0_4px_6px_-1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0_2px_4px_-2px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]` in some iterations.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Analytics Context:** All modified files (`MetricFooter.tsx`, `analyticsContainer.tsx`, `ViewContainer.tsx`, `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`) are part of an "analytics" feature, indicating a focused effort on dashboard, metric, and reporting functionalities.
*   **Redux Integration:** Consistent use of `useDispatch` and `useSelector` (often targeting `state.analyticSlice`) across multiple components for state management in the React application.
*   **PDF Export Functionality:** A recurring theme is the implementation and refinement of PDF export.
    *   Both `MetricFooter.tsx` (for individual metrics) and `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` (for the entire dashboard) utilize `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for client-side PDF generation.
    *   There's an ongoing effort to ensure proper rendering for PDF, including handling background colors (`backgroundColor: "#ffffff"`) and incorporating a logo.
*   **UI/Styling Refinement:** Frequent changes in CSS classes, icon types (Material-UI vs. React Icons), and component structures (e.g., `IconButton` vs. `Button`, `Stack` vs. `div` with flexbox) suggest active development and iteration on the user interface and user experience.
    *   Specifically, `ChipsTabView.tsx` shows numerous small adjustments to `max-width`, `gap`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` values, pointing to meticulous styling work for responsive and visually appealing chip components.
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Use of `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages is present in `ViewContainer.tsx` and `analyticsContainer.tsx`, indicating a focus on clear user feedback. `PopupAlert` is also used for confirmations.
*   **TypeScript Adoption/Refinement:** The introduction of detailed TypeScript interfaces in `ViewContainer.tsx` highlights a move towards stricter type checking and better code maintainability.
*   **Debugging Statements:** The presence of `console.log` statements in various files (`===item===:`, `===permision`, `===viewtitle==`, `viewname`) indicates active debugging during the development process.
*   **API Interaction:** Components interact with an analytics API for various operations like fetching dashboard options, saving dashboard sequences, metric sizes, and view configurations. The `apiKey` for API calls (`"nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"`) is hardcoded in the `ViewContainer` component.

## 3:26:23 PM
The log details recent changes across several files, primarily focusing on analytics and reporting functionalities within a backend service.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Initial state (11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM)**: This file defines the `getExportData` endpoint responsible for exporting analytics data. It handles date range defaults, retrieves user/company objects, constructs SQL queries for booking and non-booking reports, and includes a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES". It also applies a specific TEU filter for MBL-wise reports.
    *   **Inconsistent Changes (11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM & 11:52:44 AM)**: During this period, the file saw the introduction of `NextFunction` (though unused), duplicated import statements, and redundant `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface definitions. The `query` import path was briefly changed to `@src/common/db` and then back. A typo in error logging (`co logger.error`) was introduced and fixed (`console.log("error",error) logger.error`). Multiple redundant definitions of the `replaceColumnHandler` helper function were also introduced at the end of the file.
    *   **Refactoring and Debugging (11/3/2025, 11:54:19 AM & 11:56:23 AM)**: A major cleanup removed the duplicate imports and interface definitions. Debugging `console.log` statements were extensively added. The `nonBookingQuery` import was temporarily removed and then re-added, indicating a potential temporary break in non-booking report functionality. The `companyname` and `access` parameters were removed from the `AnalyticsControllerQuery` interface's destructuring but then passed directly to `getUserObject`. The duplicated `replaceColumnHandler` definition at the end persisted.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Initial state (11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM)**: This file defines `getMonthValue` for month-to-number mapping and `bookingQuery` for constructing SQL query fragments. `bookingQuery` contains numerous SQL query strings tailored for various booking-related reports, including stacked bar charts. It incorporates logic for date difference calculations and categorizes results into time buckets (e.g., "Less than 1 week"). There were no functional changes in the subsequent entry.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM)**: Introduces `bookingQueryBuilder`, a function that dynamically generates SQL queries for a wide range of booking analytics reports. It utilizes a `customizer` object to configure report settings (e.g., `dateRange`, `calType`, `chartType`, selected columns, date columns) and includes complex SQL for different report types (e.g., "BookingDatetoActualDeparture", "BookingDatetoActualDepartureStackedBar").
    *   **Interface Refinements (11/3/2025, 1:22:57 PM, 1:23:26 PM, & 1:26:32 PM)**: This file underwent several iterations to improve type safety. The `QueryBuilderI` interface's `customizer` parameter was explicitly typed, and new interfaces like `Customizer`, `CalColumn`, and `CalColumnConfig` were introduced to provide granular typing for the customization object's properties. The type of `reportName` in `QueryBuilderI` was also adjusted, briefly becoming less specific, then regaining some specificity. Notably, some `customizer` properties (`mblwise`, `chartType`) used in the function logic were still not explicitly included in the `Customizer` interface in the latest version.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM)**: This file contains `getTableDataReports`, a dispatcher endpoint for various analytics reports. It determines which specialized query builder (chassis, booking, container, departure, general) to invoke based on the `type` parameter in the request. It manages default date ranges, retrieves user context, and logs the generated SQL query for debugging.
    *   **Minor Debugging Addition (11/3/2025, 12:08:25 PM)**: A `console.log(error)` statement was added within the `catch` block for enhanced error visibility.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM)**: Defines `getContainerReports`, an endpoint for container-specific analytics. It handles date defaults, user authentication, and dynamically generates SQL queries based on the `group_by_column`. It includes logic for joining with `portmaster` when grouping by country and uses `replaceValueInQuery` for data standardization.
    *   **Major Type Safety & Readability Improvements (11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM)**: A significant refactoring introduced explicit TypeScript interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) for better type safety. Request parameters were destructured and typed. Variable assignments became more explicit, and comments were added to explain different code sections. The `query` call was also type-hinted.
    *   **Minor Debugging Addition (11/3/2025, 12:16:36 PM)**: A `console.log("===reqquery",req.query);` was added for debugging request parameters.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **Route Configuration (11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM)**: This file configures API routes for various analytics functionalities. It imports and registers numerous service functions (for core views, metrics, and diverse reports like Excel export, TEU, CBM, KGS, Containers, Transit, and Tables Data) to specific paths. A duplicated route `AnalyticsRoutes.get(Paths.Analytics.Get,getAll);` was present in this snapshot.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Utility Functions (11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM)**: This file houses core utility functions for analytics. It includes `defaultDateRange` for common date calculations, `replaceValueInQuery` to standardize geographical names (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES"), `getUserObject` for flexible user/company context retrieval, and `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` for generating dynamic SQL clauses based on time periods. `getExcelSelectedColumns` handles report-specific column selection logic, and `isValidDate`/`dateFilterOnExport` ensure date data quality and formatting. It also defines `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` for export mappings. The `replaceValueInQuery` function was uncommented and given a more explicit type signature.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Type Safety & Refactoring**: There's a clear and ongoing effort to improve code quality and maintainability through the introduction and refinement of TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `AnalyticsControllerQuery`, `QueryBuilderI`, `Customizer`, `ContainerReportQuery`, `AnalyticsRow`). This indicates a structured approach to development, although some interfaces still exhibit minor inconsistencies (e.g., missing properties).
2.  **Dynamic Query Generation**: The application heavily relies on dynamic SQL query generation. Functions like `bookingQuery`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, and conditional logic in `analyticsExportService` and `containerService` construct complex SQL queries based on user input and report type.
3.  **Date Handling Consistency**: `defaultDateRange` is consistently used across multiple services to establish a baseline date filter. SQL queries frequently check for invalid or default date values (e.g., `'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'`) and `dateFilterOnExport` ensures dates are formatted correctly for export.
4.  **Data Standardization**: The specific transformation of "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields is a recurring data standardization rule, encapsulated in `replaceColumnHandler` and `replaceValueInQuery`.
5.  **Debugging Practices**: Numerous `console.log` statements were added and modified across different files, especially during rapid changes, suggesting an active debugging phase.
6.  **`DISTINCT ON` Clause**: Many generated SQL queries use `DISTINCT ON (m.voyage, m.contno, CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE cont_type END)` to ensure unique entries for container-related metrics, indicating an attention to data accuracy in aggregated results.
7.  **Modular Service Architecture**: The codebase is structured with distinct service files (`analyticsExportService.ts`, `tableService.ts`, `containerService.ts`) and utility files (`export.query.ts`, `booking.query.ts`, `analytics.ts`), along with a central router (`analyticsRoutes.ts`) that dispatches requests to these services.

## 4:26:07 PM
The provided log details changes across two React/TypeScript files: `ViewContainer.tsx` and `ChipsTabView.tsx`, both located within the analytics feature of a frontend application. There are no `env` file changes or key storage updates.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`

**Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 2:22:07 PM - 11/3/2025, 2:38:33 PM**

This file, `ViewContainer.tsx`, is a React component responsible for managing custom analytical views. It allows users to select metrics ("Container Wise" or "MBL Wise") to create or edit dashboards.

**Key changes and patterns:**

*   **Initial setup:** The component uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management, Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for global state, and RTK Query (`useFetchDashboardOptionsQuery`, `useSaveDasboardMutation`) for data fetching and saving.
*   **State management:** Manages `selectedTab`, `checkBoxManager` (to track checked metrics), `viewName`, `numChecked` (maximum 9 metrics allowed), `alertConfig` for pop-up alerts, and `modal` for audit drawer.
*   **API Interactions:** It fetches dashboard options and saves/deletes dashboards via `analytics-api`. The API key `nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG` and user ID are consistently passed in queries.
*   **Core functionality:**
    *   `useEffect`: Populates `checkBoxManager` with pre-checked metrics when in "edit" mode.
    *   `handleCheckBoxClicked`: Toggles metric selection, enforces a maximum of 9 checked metrics with `toast.error` messages.
    *   `handleSave`: Validates `viewName` and `checkBoxManager` before saving (POST for new, PUT for edit). Shows `toast.success` or `toast.error` based on API response. Dispatches `setRefetchAll` and updates `dashboard` state if successful.
    *   `handleDelete`: Shows a `PopupAlert` for confirmation before deleting a view (DELETE request). Dispatches `setRefetchAll` and resets `dashboard` to "Default".
    *   `handleAudit`: Opens an `AuditViewDrawer` for viewing audit logs related to the analytics view.
*   **Minor modifications:**
    *   At 2:23:38 PM, the `Loader` component's `screen` prop (`screen="modal"`) was removed.
    *   Between 2:30:10 PM and 2:38:33 PM, multiple changes involve adding `console.log` statements for debugging `viewTitle` and `viewName`.
    *   A significant change occurred at 2:31:47 PM, where explicit TypeScript interfaces (`ViewContainerProps`, `ViewOptionItem`, `ViewOptions`, `CheckBoxManager`, `AlertConfig`, `ModalState`) were introduced for better type safety, and the component was converted to `React.FC<ViewContainerProps>`.
    *   Error handling for `handleSave` and `handleDelete` was improved by wrapping API calls in `try...catch` blocks to show more specific `toast.error` messages (e.g., "Failed to save view", "Delete failed").
    *   The `viewName` state initialization was changed from `viewTitle || ""` to `viewTitle` (2:34:02 PM) and then back to `viewTitle || ""` (2:38:33 PM). A `useEffect` was also added (2:38:19 PM) to explicitly set `viewName` from `viewTitle` when in "edit" mode, ensuring the input field correctly reflects the current view's title.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`

**Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 2:24:22 PM - 11/3/2025, 3:31:06 PM**

This file, `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, appears to be a toolbar component for the analytics screen, featuring filtering, custom view management, and PDF export functionality.

**Key changes and patterns:**

*   **PDF Export Functionality:** The most prominent feature in this file is the `downloadDashboardPDF` asynchronous function. This function uses `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` to capture a specific HTML element (`#metric-board`) and export it as a PDF, including a logo. There are multiple commented-out versions of this function, suggesting iterative development and refinement of the PDF export logic.
    *   The latest version of `downloadDashboardPDF` (consistent across all timestamps in this file) includes robust error handling for image loading and PDF generation, and uses `getBase64Image` to ensure the logo is properly embedded.
*   **State and Redux:** The component uses `useDispatch` and `useSelector` to interact with the Redux store (`analyticSlice`) for managing dashboard selections, global filters, and operation types.
*   **UI Components:** Imports various UI components like `SelectBox`, `SwitchTab`, `ChipsTabView`, `DateRange`, `PopoverPanel`, `AppDrawer`, `ViewContainer`, `InputBox`, `RadioNav`, `Button`, `IconButton`.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The "Manage View" button is conditionally rendered based on whether the `selectedDashboard` is "Default" or "_Default_".
*   **Debugging:** Numerous `console.log` statements are present to log `permission` and `toolState`, indicating ongoing debugging during development.
*   **Minor modifications:**
    *   Minor icon imports were added (e.g., `PlusIcon` at 3:05:04 PM, `PresentationChartLineIcon` at 3:21:27 PM and 3:22:18 PM, `HiPresentationChartLine` at 3:23:44 PM).
    *   The `ChipsTabView` `buttonConfig` icon was changed multiple times (e.g., from `AddCircleOutlineOutlined` at 3:05:04 PM to `PlusIcon` at 3:05:04 PM, then removed, and later added back via `AddCircleOutlineOutlined` or `HiPresentationChartLine`).

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`

**Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 2:43:19 PM - 11/3/2025, 3:28:26 PM**

This file, `ChipsTabView.tsx`, is a reusable React component for displaying a scrollable row of selectable "chip" buttons, often used for tabs or options, with an optional "New" button.

**Key changes and patterns:**

*   **Initial Structure:** The component is a functional React component using `useRef` for scrollable container management. It takes `options`, `value`, `onChange`, `buttonChip`, `buttonConfig`, and `handleButtonClick` as props.
*   **Scroll Functionality:** Includes `handleScroll` function to navigate the chips left and right, with `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` icons.
*   **Styling Refinements (frequent changes):** This file shows a consistent pattern of iterative CSS class adjustments, primarily around:
    *   **Width and Max-width:** The `max-w` property of the main container (`div`) was frequently adjusted: `max-w-[520px]` (2:43:19 PM), `max-w-[180px]` (3:07:07 PM), `max-w-[800px]` (3:03:06 PM, 3:05:58 PM, 3:06:08 PM, 3:06:31 PM), `max-w-[900px]` (3:08:24 PM, 3:09:50 PM, 3:10:27 PM, 3:10:37 PM, 3:11:06 PM, 3:12:19 PM, 3:12:33 PM, 3:12:51 PM, 3:13:08 PM, 3:13:36 PM), `max-w-[950px]` (3:13:42 PM), `max-w-[1200px]` (3:13:55 PM, 3:26:59 PM), `max-w-[1000px]` (3:14:03 PM), `max-w-[1100px]` (3:14:14 PM, 3:16:11 PM, 3:17:04 PM, 3:17:37 PM, 3:17:57 PM, 3:18:18 PM, 3:18:40 PM, 3:27:19 PM, 3:27:33 PM, 3:27:52 PM) and finally `max-w-[1150px]` (3:26:38 PM, 3:28:26 PM). This suggests an effort to optimize the component's width for different screen sizes or content amounts.
    *   **Button Sizing and Appearance:**
        *   Initial buttons were `px-4 py-1.5 rounded-full border text-sm font-medium`.
        *   Later, they shifted to fixed widths and heights: `w-[180px] h-[40px] rounded-lg px-4 py-2` (3:01:42 PM onwards) and even `w-[220px] min-w-[200px] h-[44px]` (3:08:24 PM).
        *   Shadows and background colors were frequently adjusted (`shadow-[0_4px_6px_-1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0_2px_4px_-2px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]`, `bg-[var(--Background-backgroundHoverOverlay,#00000006)]`, `bg-gray-100`).
        *   Rounded corners changed between `rounded-full`, `rounded-lg`, and `rounded-md`.
    *   **Icon Placement and Sizing:** The `buttonConfig.icon` and `option.icon` elements had their margin adjusted (e.g., `ml-4`, `mr-2`, `ml-3`) and icon `fontSize` changed from `"small"` to `"large"` (3:13:08 PM). The icon was initially rendered before the label, then after.
    *   **Scrollbar Hiding:** Consistent CSS to hide scrollbars (`scrollbar-hide` class with `msOverflowStyle` and `scrollbarWidth` for cross-browser compatibility, and `::-webkit-scrollbar` for Chrome/Safari/Opera).
*   **Floating Label:** A `p` tag with absolute positioning serves as a floating label above the chips.
*   **Flexbox Layout:** The internal structure consistently uses flexbox for alignment and spacing of chips and scroll buttons.

### General Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Redux/RTK Query:** Both `ViewContainer.tsx` and `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` heavily rely on Redux for state management and RTK Query for API interactions, using `useDispatch`, `useSelector`, and mutation/query hooks.
*   **Toast Notifications:** `react-hot-toast` is used across the `ViewContainer.tsx` for user feedback (success, error messages).
*   **UI Component Imports:** Common UI components from `@components/common` (e.g., `Loader`, `PopupAlert`, `AuditViewDrawer`, `RadioNav`, `InputBox`, `ChipsTabView`) and `@components/kit/button` (`Button`) are frequently imported and used.
*   **Styling (Tailwind CSS-like classes):** Extensive use of utility-first CSS classes (e.g., `w-[500px]`, `flex justify-end gap-2`, `bg-blue-600`) suggests a Tailwind CSS setup.
*   **Debugging (`console.log`):** Frequent use of `console.log` statements for debugging purposes, particularly for `toolState` in `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` and `viewTitle`/`viewName` in `ViewContainer.tsx`.
*   **API Key:** The `apiKey: "nRKniUrJd6rjNCyvT8iRRHmG"` appears hardcoded in API calls across `ViewContainer.tsx`, which might be a security or configuration concern in a production environment.
*   **PDF Generation:** The `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` component is dedicated to PDF export functionality using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`, including complex logic for image conversion and PDF layout.
*   **Iterative UI Refinement:** The `ChipsTabView.tsx` file clearly shows a history of fine-tuning CSS classes for layout, spacing, and appearance, indicating continuous UI/UX improvements.

## 4:26:32 PM
The provided log details a series of changes across several backend services and utilities, primarily focused on analytics and reporting functionalities, with a significant emphasis on data querying, processing, and user preferences.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/3/2025, 11:51:04 AM):** Introduced the `getExportData` controller to handle the export of analytics reports. It differentiated between booking and non-booking reports, applied date filtering, fetched user and company context, and included a helper function (`replaceColumnHandler`) to standardize port names (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES"). It also featured an MBLwise TEU filter for non-booking reports.
    *   **Refactoring and Corrections (11/3/2025, 11:52:28 AM to 11:56:23 AM):** Subsequent changes reflect a refactoring process. Initially, duplicate imports and interface definitions were introduced, and the database `query` import path was temporarily incorrect (`@src/common/db` instead of `@src/common/util/database`). These issues were addressed in later commits. The `nonBookingQuery` import was briefly removed and then reinstated. Debugging `console.log` statements were added and adjusted, and the `replaceColumnHandler` function was consolidated. The structure for retrieving user/company information (`getUserObject`) was made more explicit.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Introduction of Dynamic Query Generation (11/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM):** This file was created to house the `bookingQuery` function and a `getMonthValue` helper. `bookingQuery` generates complex SQL query fragments tailored to various report names, especially for stacked bar charts, incorporating filters based on month, week, or quarter.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **Core Query Builder Implementation (11/3/2025, 12:00:20 PM):** Introduced `bookingQueryBuilder`, a crucial function for constructing SQL queries for a wide array of booking and cargo-ready related analytics. It dynamically sets `customizer` properties (e.g., `dateRange`, `calType`, `chartType`, `dateColumns`, `booking`, `mblwise`, `calColumnConfig`) and generates detailed SQL queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for calculations, including percentages and date differences for stacked bar charts.
    *   **Interface Refinement (11/3/2025, 1:22:57 PM to 1:29:32 PM):** This file saw several updates to its TypeScript interfaces (`Customizer`, `QueryBuilderI`, `CalColumn`, `CalColumnConfig`), progressively making them more explicit, robust, and type-safe to accurately reflect the complex configuration objects used by the query builder.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\tableService.ts`**
    *   **Analytics Report Dispatcher (11/3/2025, 12:02:23 PM):** The `getTableDataReports` controller was introduced as a central point for handling various analytics requests. It uses a large `else if` block to dispatch to different query builders (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`) based on the requested report type, ensuring flexibility in serving diverse analytical needs. A debugging `console.log` was added to show the generated query (11/3/2025, 12:08:25 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\containerService.ts`**
    *   **Container Reporting Logic (11/3/2025, 12:11:01 PM):** Implemented `getContainerReports` to provide analytics specifically for container data. This service dynamically generates SQL queries to group and count containers by various criteria, including country of origin/discharge and trucker, applying special conditions where necessary (e.g., for trucker types of move).
    *   **Code Structure and Typing Improvement (11/3/2025, 12:13:38 PM):** Significant refactoring to enhance readability and maintainability, including the introduction of dedicated TypeScript interfaces (`ContainerReportQuery`, `Customizer`, `AnalyticsRow`) and improved internal commenting. A debugging `console.log` was added to `req.query` (11/3/2025, 12:16:36 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\analyticsRoutes.ts`**
    *   **Analytics Route Consolidation (11/3/2025, 12:21:34 PM):** This file was updated to centralize all analytics-related API endpoints. It maps routes for core views, metrics, Excel reports, TEU, CBM, KGS, containers, transit, and table data reports to their respective service functions. A minor redundancy with `Paths.Analytics.Get` was noted.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Analytics Utilities (11/3/2025, 1:22:26 PM):** This utility file was significantly expanded to include several helper functions:
        *   `defaultDateRange`: Provides a standard 365-day date range.
        *   `replaceValueInQuery`: Normalizes port names (e.g., "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES") within SQL queries.
        *   `getUserObject`: Retrieves user and company details, including admin access handling.
        *   `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`: Generates SQL fragments for grouping and ordering by month, week, or quarter.
        *   `getExcelSelectedColumns`: Selects appropriate columns for Excel exports based on report type and booking status, with special logic for specific reports (e.g., network days for cargo-ready date reports).
        *   `dateFilterOnExport`: Filters and formats date fields within data rows for export, validating dates and formatting valid ones to 'MM/DD/YYYY' using `moment.js`.
        *   `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`: A comprehensive list of column mappings for Excel exports.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\UserService.ts`**
    *   **User Management Enhancements (11/3/2025, 3:39:14 PM):** The `UserService` was enhanced with new functionalities:
        *   `login`: Updated to cast `companyname` to lowercase during login and include it in the token payload.
        *   `saveUserPreferences`, `fetchUserPreferences`: For managing user-specific settings, using `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for persistence.
        *   `saveInviteLog`, `fetchAllCompanyUser`: For handling user invitations and fetching lists of active/pending users within a company.
        *   `userSettings`: To retrieve specific user settings like `date_format`.
        *   Extensive logging was added to these new functions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\index.ts`**
    *   **Root Router Integration (11/3/2025, 3:39:25 PM):** The main application router was updated to integrate the newly organized `UserRoutes`, `NotificationRoutes`, and `AnalyticsRoutes`. It also added new endpoints for fetching company details and audit logs.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Standardized Date Handling:** A consistent pattern emerged for handling date ranges, using `defaultDateRange()` when dates are not provided and applying specific SQL timestamp filters (`>= '${fromDate}'::timestamp AND < '${toDate}'::timestamp + INTERVAL '1 day'`) across many queries.
*   **Geographic Data Normalization:** The recurring use of functions like `replaceColumnHandler` and `replaceValueInQuery` to convert "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for `pod` and `place_of_delivery` indicates a core data standardization requirement.
*   **User and Company Context:** The `getUserObject` utility is central to retrieving user-specific `usercode` and `companyname`, which are then used to filter data across almost all analytical queries, suggesting a robust multi-tenant or role-based access control system.
*   **Dynamic SQL Query Construction:** Services heavily rely on "query builder" functions (e.g., `bookingQueryBuilder`, `chassisQueryBuilder`) to dynamically assemble complex SQL queries based on requested report types and parameters, often utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for intermediate calculations.
*   **Type Safety Evolution:** Throughout the changes, there's a clear progression towards more explicit and detailed TypeScript interfaces for query parameters, `customizer` objects, and data rows, improving code maintainability and reducing potential runtime errors.
*   **Comprehensive Logging and Debugging:** `logger.info` and `logger.error` are extensively used for application monitoring and error tracking. Additionally, `console.log` statements frequently appear for debugging purposes during development.
*   **Database Interaction:** All analytical services directly interact with the database via a shared `query` utility, highlighting a direct data access approach.
*   **Distinct Data Handling in Queries:** Many SQL queries include `DISTINCT ON (m.voyage, m.contno, CASE WHEN m.t49_cont_type IS NOT NULL ... END)` clauses to ensure unique container or MBL entries, especially when calculating aggregated values like counts or averages.

## 4:30:18 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts`, last updated on 11/3/2025 at 3:44:37 PM, defines an analytics controller responsible for generating various data reports.

The main function `getTableDataReports` serves as a central dispatcher for different analytics requests. It processes incoming requests, extracting parameters like `fromDate`, `toDate`, `type`, `displayBy`, `companyname`, `access`, and `reportName`.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Date Range Handling**: It initializes default `fromDate` and `toDate` if not provided in the request.
*   **User and Company Context**: It retrieves `CompanyName` and `user_id` using `getUserObject`, indicating support for multi-tenant or user-specific data filtering.
*   **Modular Query Building**: The controller utilizes a large `if-else if` structure to dynamically route requests to specialized query builder functions based on the `type` parameter in the request. These builders include:
    *   `chassisQueryBuilder` for chassis-related metrics (e.g., `Averagechassisuseddays`, `ChassisPUdateVsFinalDeliveryDate`).
    *   `bookingQueryBuilder` handles a comprehensive array of booking and cargo-ready related reports, along with container shipping metrics and total spend per month. This builder is responsible for the most diverse set of reports.
    *   `containerQueryBuilder` for container-specific reports (e.g., `ContainerDischargevsContainerAvailable`, `VesselDepartureToConsigneeDoor`).
    *   `departureQueryBuilder` for departure-related KPIs (e.g., `BLReleaseKPI`, `DelayedPOLDepartures`, `OriginalETAvsActualETA`).
    *   `generalQueryBuilder` for general shipment statistics (`TotalShipments`, `TotalShipmentsMblWise`).
*   **Query Execution**: For most report types, the controller constructs a SQL query using the appropriate builder and then executes it against the database using a `query` utility. The `generalQueryBuilder` is an exception, as it directly returns processed data, bypassing the generic query execution step.
*   **Error Handling**: A `try-catch` block ensures robust error handling, logging errors, and returning a 500 Internal Server Error for unhandled exceptions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   The `type` parameter is central to dictating the report logic, acting as a crucial differentiator between various analytics requests.
*   Most query builder functions receive a consistent set of parameters: `type`, `customizer`, `CompanyName`, `fromDate`, `toDate`, `user_id`, and `reportName`, with `displayBy` occasionally included.
*   The code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with the controller managing request parsing and dispatching, and dedicated query builders handling the specific SQL logic for each report type.

## 4:30:29 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js`, last modified on `11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM`, serves as a central hub for various utility functions related to analytics reporting and data visualization within a frontend application.

Key functionalities include:

*   **Text Truncation:** A `TruncateText` utility function is provided to shorten strings for display purposes.
*   **Metric Processing (`metricsPackageHandler`):** This core function processes raw metric data, dynamically determining the chart type (e.g., Count, StackedBar, Transit, General) and calculating aggregate values (Total, Average, or NA) based on customizer settings. It also applies specific formatting based on date ranges or volume. The output is a structured object ready for chart rendering, including report names, column/row spans, and customized headers.
*   **Chart Configuration:** The file defines `allChartOptions` (listing available chart types like bar, pie, line, stack, gauge with corresponding MUI icons) and `chartOptionsByType` (mapping broader chart categories to specific displayable chart keys).
*   **Report Formula Generation (`reportFormula`):** A function to construct mathematical formulas based on selected date columns, specifically handling "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" and general two-date column calculations.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `weekDateFormater` function formats dates into a 'D MMM' string using `moment.js`.
*   **Excel Report Export (`downloadReportSpreadsheet`):** This extensive asynchronous function uses `exceljs` and `file-saver` to generate and download detailed Excel spreadsheets. It dynamically constructs report headers and data rows based on the report item, period filters (month, week, quarter), view filters, user information, and selected columns. The logic branches significantly based on `chartType` (especially "StackedBar" and "transitBar") and specific `reportName` values like "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped", "Total Spend per Month", "Average Transit Time per Month", and "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (Stacked Bar +/- 10 Days)". Each branch customizes the data mapping to Excel columns, often including values like "Less than 1 week", "This Quarter", or "Less than 10 days" depending on the report.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dynamic Data Handling:** There is a consistent pattern of using conditional logic (if/else if statements) based on `item.customizer.chartType`, `item.reportName`, and `periodFilter` to tailor data processing, header generation, and data mapping for Excel exports.
*   **Date and Time Utilities:** `moment.js` is frequently used for various date formatting and manipulation tasks across different functions.
*   **`customizer` Object:** The `customizer` object appears to be a crucial configuration mechanism, driving how metrics are interpreted, charted, and presented in reports, particularly for `chartType`, `calType`, and `dateColumns`.
*   **ExcelJS Integration:** The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function demonstrates a robust integration with `ExcelJS` to programmatically build complex spreadsheets, including static and dynamic headers, and detailed data rows derived from various report types.
*   **Period-based Data Segmentation:** Multiple stacked bar reports show a recurring structure for mapping data based on "month", "week", or "quarter" period filters, often featuring comparative columns like "This Quarter" vs. "Last Quarter" or specific time-based buckets.

    This file underwent numerous, highly iterative styling and layout adjustments over a short period (from 11/3/2025, 2:43:19 PM to 3:28:26 PM). Key changes include:
    *   **Scrollbar Management**: Added inline styles (`msOverflowStyle`, `scrollbarWidth`) and a `<style>` tag for `::-webkit-scrollbar` to hide scrollbars consistently across browsers (11/3/2025, 2:50:09 PM).
    *   **Layout and Sizing**: Frequent adjustments to the `max-width` of the main container (e.g., `max-w-[520px]` to `max-w-[1150px]`), the `gap` between items (e.g., `gap-2` to `gap-3`), and explicit `width`/`height` properties for buttons (e.g., `w-[180px] h-[40px]`).
    *   **Button Appearance**: Iterative changes to `border-radius` (from `rounded-full` to `rounded-lg` and `rounded-md`), `box-shadow` values (`shadow-[0_4px_6px...]` to `shadow-[0_1px_3px...]`), `background` colors, and `text-colors` for both active and inactive chip buttons.
    *   **Icon Placement and Sizing**: Chevron navigation icons' `fontSize` was changed multiple times (e.g., `small` to `large` around 11/3/2025, 3:13:08 PM and 3:13:36 PM). Icons within chip buttons were also wrapped in `span` tags with specific text color classes and adjusted margins.
    *   **Element Order**: The "New" button (if configured) was reordered to appear before the list of dynamic options (11/3/2025, 2:57:06 PM).
    *   **Positional Adjustments**: A negative left margin (`ml-[-4px]`, then `ml-[-6px]`) was added to the main container (starting 11/3/2025, 3:27:33 PM) for precise horizontal alignment.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**
    *   **Icon Imports**: The most prominent changes are in the component's imports for UI icons.
        *   Initially imported `MagnifyingGlassIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` (11/3/2025, 2:44:24 PM).
        *   `PlusIcon` was added to the same `@heroicons/react/16/solid` import (11/3/2025, 3:05:04 PM).
        *   `ShowChart` from `@mui/icons-material` and `PresentationChartLineIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` were added (11/3/2025, 3:21:27 PM).
        *   Later, `MagnifyingGlassIcon` and `PlusIcon` were removed, and `PresentationChartLineIcon`'s path was updated to `@heroicons/react/24/solid` (11/3/2025, 3:22:02 PM).
        *   `HiPresentationChartLine` from `react-icons/hi2` was subsequently added (11/3/2025, 3:23:44 PM).
    *   The core functionality, including the PDF generation logic (which remains largely commented out except for a `downloadDashboardPDF` function using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`), Redux state handling, and various filter/tab change handlers, remained stable.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**
    *   This file saw no discernible code changes between its two log entries. It maintains its structure for rendering resizable and draggable metric boxes within a grid, handling interactions like reordering, resizing, and fetching data for individual reports using Redux and API hooks.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`**
    *   This file also saw no discernible code changes in its single log entry. It provides footer actions for metric boxes, including exporting data to Excel (with column selection) and PDF, displaying calculated values, and toggling a fullscreen view. It uses `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` for PDF generation, rendering content to a hidden element before capturing it.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics-Specific Functionality**: The log entries consistently show development focused on an analytics dashboard, including custom view management, metric display, filtering, and reporting (PDF/Excel exports).
*   **React Ecosystem**: Heavy reliance on React functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), and Redux for state management, specifically Redux Toolkit Query for API interactions.
*   **UI/UX Refinements**: Numerous changes are dedicated to the user interface, particularly the `ChipsTabView` component, which undergoes extensive styling iteration using Tailwind CSS classes. This indicates a focus on visual presentation and user interaction for navigating different dashboard views.
*   **PDF Export Implementation**: Both `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` and `MetricFooter.tsx` feature `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` for generating PDF reports, suggesting a critical requirement for data export functionality within the application. The `AnalyticsToolbar` includes commented-out, more complex PDF generation logic, hinting at ongoing development or troubleshooting for this feature.
*   **User Context**: User details (userid, role, companyname) are consistently accessed from `localStorage` and utilized in API requests and access control checks (`useAccess` hook).
*   **Toast Notifications**: `react-hot-toast` is a recurring element for providing non-blocking user feedback (success/error messages) for actions like saving or deleting data.

## 5:30:21 PM
The provided log details recent code changes within the `t360-backend` project, focusing on analytics reporting and OTM (Oracle Transportation Management) Bill of Lading functionalities. Both updates occurred on the same date, 11/3/2025, suggesting a coordinated development effort.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 3:44:37 PM):**
    This file, which handles various analytics reports, received a significant expansion of its `getTableDataReports` function. The function now supports a much broader range of report `type` parameters, particularly for "booking & cargo-ready" analytics. New report types include detailed metrics around confirmation dates, cargo ready dates, actual and estimated departure times, arrival at POD, discharge dates, container availability and delivery dates, outgate dates, average transit time, and total spend per month. This indicates an increased granularity and scope for operational insights within the system, utilizing a modular approach with dedicated query builders for different categories like chassis, booking, containers, and departures.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 5:05:37 PM):**
    This file, defining API routes for OTM Bill of Lading operations, was updated to introduce several new functionalities. A new POST route, `/upload_save_edit`, was added, likely refining or replacing previous upload mechanisms. Additionally, new routes were introduced for fetching BOL data by a `common_key` (`/fetch/:common_key`), generating XML related to BOLs (`/generate_xml`), and sending data directly to the OTM system (`/send_to_otm`). An older `/upload` route for BOL excel uploads has been commented out, indicating a shift in how these uploads are handled.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes reflect an ongoing enhancement of the backend system's capabilities. The analytics controller shows a clear pattern of continuous expansion to support more specific and detailed reporting metrics, suggesting a drive for deeper operational insights. The OTM route updates indicate a move towards a more comprehensive and automated integration with OTM, encompassing data retrieval by various keys, streamlined upload processes, and direct programmatic interaction for XML generation and data submission. Both sets of updates focus on improving data utility, either through enhanced reporting or more robust external system integration.

## 5:30:34 PM
This log details significant updates to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js` on **November 3, 2025, at 3:47:35 PM**.

The changes primarily revolve around analytics reporting, data transformation, and Excel export functionalities. Key updates include:

*   **Utility Functions**:
    *   A `TruncateText` function was added for basic text shortening.
    *   A `weekDateFormater` function uses `moment.js` to format dates as "D MMM".
*   **Analytics Metrics Handling (`metricsPackageHandler`)**:
    *   This function processes raw metric data for display, determining chart types (`AnalyticsChartType` enum is used), calculating aggregate values (total, average, or "NA" based on `calType`), and applying formatting settings.
    *   It dynamically sets report headers and calculation details based on `customizer` properties.
*   **Chart Configuration**:
    *   `allChartOptions` defines available chart types (bar, pie, line, stack, gauge) with corresponding Material UI icons.
    *   `chartOptionsByType` maps general analytics chart categories (e.g., `General`, `StackBar`, `Transit`, `Count`) to specific visual chart options.
*   **Report Formula Generation (`reportFormula`)**:
    *   A function to generate dynamic formulas based on report name and selected date columns, specifically for "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" and other reports involving two date columns.
*   **Excel Report Download (`downloadReportSpreadsheet`)**:
    *   This is the most extensive new functionality, enabling the export of various analytics reports to Excel using `ExcelJS`.
    *   It meticulously structures the Excel file, including report metadata (metric name, client, date range).
    *   **Dynamic Header Adjustments**: The header row adapts based on `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) for "StackedBar" charts and inserts a "View" row for "transitBar" charts.
    *   **Conditional Data Mapping**: The core data population logic is highly conditional, adapting to different `chartType` values and `reportName`s:
        *   For general reports (non-StackedBar, 3-column headers), data is mapped directly, and aggregate rows (Average, Total) are appended.
        *   For various `StackedBar` reports (e.g., "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped", "Total Spend per Month", "Average Transit Time per Month", "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (+/- 10 Days)"), data is mapped specifically according to the `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) to corresponding columns like "Less than 1 week", "This Quarter", "Less than 10 days", etc.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:

*   **Heavy Reliance on `customizer`**: Many functions, especially `metricsPackageHandler` and `downloadReportSpreadsheet`, extensively use the `item.customizer` object to determine chart types, calculation methods, and data presentation.
*   **Conditional Logic for Chart/Report Types**: There's a strong pattern of using `if/else if` statements to differentiate behavior based on `item.customizer.chartType` and `item.reportName`, indicating a system designed to handle diverse analytics reports.
*   **Date and Period Filtering**: The `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) is a recurring element, particularly when structuring data for `StackedBar` charts in the Excel export, necessitating specific column mappings for each period type.
*   **Moment.js for Date Handling**: `moment` is consistently used for parsing and formatting dates across different functions.
*   **ExcelJS for Export**: The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function demonstrates a complex and repetitive structure for building Excel spreadsheets, with similar conditional mappings based on report characteristics.

## 6:31:33 PM
The `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts` file, updated on November 3, 2025, at 3:44:37 PM, primarily defines the `getTableDataReports` function. This function serves as a central endpoint for generating various analytics reports. It dynamically constructs SQL queries based on the `type` parameter from the request, along with date ranges, company name, and user ID. The controller imports and utilizes several specialized query builder functions (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`). A significant portion of its logic is dedicated to a large conditional block (`if-else if`) that maps a vast array of specific report types (e.g., 'Averagechassisuseddays', 'BookingDatetoActualDeparture', 'ContainerDischargevsContainerAvailable', 'DelayedPOLDepartures') to the appropriate query builder. It defaults date ranges if not provided and executes the constructed query against the database, returning the results.

The `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts` file, modified later on November 3, 2025, at 5:05:37 PM, sets up the API routes for Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) Bill of Lading (BOL) operations. It defines several GET and POST endpoints, including fetching BOL data by various keys (`:bol`, `:common_key`), retrieving payload, exporting data to Excel, editing BOLs, handling upload and saving of edits, generating XML documents, and sending BOL information to OTM. Notably, a route for file upload (`/upload`) using `uploadMiddleware` is present but commented out in the provided code snippet.

Both changes occurred on the same day, November 3, 2025, suggesting a focused development or update cycle. The analytics controller highlights a complex, data-intensive reporting system with many specific report types, while the OTM BOL route demonstrates an API designed for integrating with an external system and managing specific domain-related data. Both files are part of a `t360-backend` application, indicating ongoing development in a backend TypeScript environment.

## 6:32:03 PM
`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`
This file, defining a `ChipsTabView` component, underwent continuous refinement throughout the log. The component features a scrollable row of customizable chip-style buttons, optional left/right scroll navigation, and a floating label. Key updates include:
*   **Styling Iterations (2:53 PM - 3:18 PM):** Extensive adjustments were made to the visual appearance of the chip buttons. This involved frequent changes to their dimensions (e.g., `px-4 py-1.5` to `px-4 py-2`, `w-[180px] h-[40px]`, `min-w-[160px] h-[42px]`), border-radius (`rounded-full`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, `rounded-md`), and shadow properties. The active state color for selected chips transitioned from a `bg-blue-600` to `bg-gray-100` (with a brief `bg-gray-700` experiment), indicating a shift in color scheme.
*   **Layout Adjustments (3:01 PM - 3:28 PM):** The `max-width` of the main container was repeatedly modified (from `max-w-[520px]` incrementally up to `max-w-[1200px]`, then down to `max-w-[1100px]`/`max-w-[1150px]`), alongside fine-tuning of horizontal positioning using `ml-[-4px]` and `ml-[-6px]` classes. The `gap` between chips was also adjusted between `gap-2` and `gap-3`.
*   **Feature Enhancements (3:09 PM):** The `Option` interface was extended to support an optional `icon`, allowing icons to be displayed within the individual chip buttons. The rendering logic for both regular option chips and the special "New" button was updated to accommodate these icons with specific spacing and text coloring.
*   **Interaction Refinement (3:12 PM - 3:13 PM):** The size of the `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` scroll icons was increased from `small` to `large`.
*   **Code Organization (2:57 PM):** The "New" button, when enabled via `buttonChip`, was reordered to appear before the mapped `options`, ensuring its consistent first position.
*   **Debugging (6:03 PM - 6:04 PM):** `console.log` statements were added to inspect the `options` and `value` props, suggesting active debugging during later changes.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`
This file, representing the analytics toolbar, remained functionally stable, with its primary evolution focused on dependency management:
*   **Icon Imports (3:05 PM - 3:23 PM):** There was a series of changes related to importing icons. Initially, `MagnifyingGlassIcon` was used. `PlusIcon` and `PresentationChartLineIcon` were added from `@heroicons/react/16/solid`, then `PresentationChartLineIcon` was re-imported from `@heroicons/react/24/solid` (indicating a change in icon size preference), and finally, `HiPresentationChartLine` from `react-icons/hi2` was introduced. This pattern suggests an ongoing evaluation or refactoring of icon libraries.
*   **Core Functionality:** The logic for PDF generation (`downloadDashboardPDF`), state management with Redux (`toolState`), and filter handling remained consistent.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`
No significant code changes were observed in this file. It consistently manages the drag-and-drop reordering (`moveItem`) and resizing (`saveSize`) of metrics within a grid layout, interacting with Redux for state and a backend API for persistence. It also handles fetching individual report data and packaging it for display.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\MetricFooter.tsx`
No significant code changes were observed in this file. It provides controls and information for individual metric boxes, such as exporting data to Excel (`handleExcel`), generating PDF reports (`handlePdf`), enlarging the metric view, and displaying calculated values or formulas.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx`
This file, defining a `GaugeChart` component, saw focused changes in its visual presentation:
*   **Color Scheme (5:58 PM - 5:59 PM):** The conditional fill color for the radial bar chart, specifically when `value` is `belowLimit` (less than 3), was iteratively adjusted. It changed from `green` (`#008000`) to `dark gray/black` (`#09090B`), and then to a lighter shade of gray (`#595959`). The `gradientToColors` was also synchronized with these changes. This indicates a design refinement for how low values are highlighted in the gauge.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`
No significant code changes were observed in this file. It provides functionality for users to create, edit, or delete custom dashboard views, including metric selection and audit logging, all managed through Redux and API interactions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **UI/UX Focus:** A clear pattern of meticulous UI/UX iteration is evident, especially in `chip-tabs-view.tsx` and `GaugeChart.tsx`, with frequent adjustments to styling, sizing, colors, and iconography. This suggests an ongoing effort to perfect the visual and interactive aspects of the frontend.
*   **Consistent PDF Export:** Both `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` and `MetricFooter.tsx` utilize `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` for client-side PDF generation, indicating a standardized approach to this functionality across the application.
*   **Redux and Data Flow:** Redux is consistently used across `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, `analyticsContainer.tsx`, `MetricFooter.tsx`, and `ViewContainer.tsx` for state management, demonstrating a centralized data architecture. Local storage is also leveraged for user context.
*   **API Interaction with RTK Query:** API calls are consistently implemented using RTK Query hooks (e.g., `useLazyFetchReportQuery`, `useSaveSequenceMutation`) for data fetching and mutation, ensuring a structured and efficient interaction with the backend.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The inclusion of `console.log` statements in `chip-tabs-view.tsx` highlights a common debugging practice during active development phases.

*   **User and Company Context**: The `getUserObject()` utility is widely used to retrieve `usercode` and `companyname`, which are critical for filtering data in queries.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation**: A pervasive pattern is the dynamic construction of complex PostgreSQL queries (using `DISTINCT ON`, `EXTRACT`, `CASE` statements, `JOIN`s, `REGEXP_REPLACE`) based on user-selected report types and filters.
*   **Data Standardization**: The replacement of "LONG BEACH" with "LOS ANGELES" is a recurring data cleanup step across multiple services and utility functions.
*   **Type Safety Enhancement**: Throughout the logs, there's a clear trend of introducing and refining TypeScript interfaces (e.g., in `booking.query.ts` and `containerService.ts`) to improve type definition, leading to more robust and maintainable code.
*   **Extensive Logging**: `logger.info` and `logger.error` are heavily used across all service files, often accompanied by `console.log` statements, indicating a strong emphasis on debugging and monitoring.
*   **Categorized Reporting Logic**: Report types are often categorized (e.g., "BookingDatetoActualDeparture", "Container_Wise", "MBL_Wise") and processed by dedicated query builders or specific conditional logic blocks.
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent `try-catch` blocks are implemented in service functions to handle errors gracefully and return generic "Internal Server Error" responses.

## 7:40:15 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js` was last modified on 11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM.

This file primarily defines utility functions and logic for handling and displaying analytics data within a frontend application, with a strong focus on chart rendering and Excel report generation.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Data Truncation:** A `TruncateText` utility is provided to shorten strings with an ellipsis if they exceed a specified length.
*   **Metric Processing (`metricsPackageHandler`):** This central function transforms raw metric data into a structured format suitable for display. It dynamically determines the chart type (e.g., Count, Stackbar, Transit, General) and calculates aggregate values (Avg, Total) based on customizer settings. It also applies specific formatting rules for dates or volumes.
*   **Chart Configuration:**
    *   `allChartOptions`: Lists available chart types (bar, pie, line, stack, gauge) with their corresponding Material-UI icons.
    *   `chartOptionsByType`: Maps broader analytics chart categories (General, StackBar, Transit, Count) to specific visual chart types.
*   **Report Formula Generation (`reportFormula`):** A function to construct formula strings based on report name and selected date columns, specifically handling transit time calculations.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `weekDateFormater` function formats dates into a 'D MMM' string using `moment.js`.

    *   It meticulously builds the report header with details like metric name, client, and date ranges.
    *   Headers are dynamically adjusted based on the `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) and `chartType`.
    *   The core logic involves extensive conditional statements to map and format data rows based on the `chartType` (e.g., `StackedBar`, general charts) and the specific `reportName` (e.g., "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "Containers Shipped", "Total Spend per Month").
    *   It calculates and appends total or average rows based on the customizer's `calType`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Conditional Logic:** The code heavily relies on `if/else if` statements, especially within `downloadReportSpreadsheet` and `metricsPackageHandler`, to adapt processing based on `chartType`, `reportName`, and `periodFilter`. This indicates a highly dynamic and customizable reporting system.
*   **Date and Time Handling:** The `moment.js` library is frequently used for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates, particularly for displaying period ranges in reports and chart labels.
*   **Customizer Object:** The `customizer` object is a recurring and critical element, central to defining how a metric or report should be processed, rendered, and exported, including its chart type, calculation type, headers, and date columns.
*   **ExcelJS and FileSaver:** These libraries are consistently used together for the sole purpose of exporting data into structured Excel files.
*   **Modular Reporting:** The `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function demonstrates a pattern of handling different report types and period filters distinctly within its structure, suggesting a well-defined approach to accommodating various analytics views.
*   **UI/UX Integration:** Imports from `@mui/icons-material` and the definition of `allChartOptions` and `chartOptionsByType` highlight the integration with a user interface for selecting and displaying different chart visualizations.

## 7:40:27 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing analytics capabilities, refining OTM (Oracle Transportation Management) related routes, and introducing comprehensive utility functions for data handling and reporting. All documented changes occurred on November 3, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 3:44:37 PM)**
    This controller acts as a central hub for generating a wide variety of analytics reports. It includes `getTableDataReports` which dynamically constructs SQL queries based on the requested report `type`. The function delegates query building to specialized modules like `chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, and `generalQueryBuilder`. It handles default date ranges, retrieves user and company context using `getUserObject`, and logs generated queries before execution. The controller supports an extensive list of report types covering chassis usage, various booking and cargo-ready date metrics, container events, and departure KPIs.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\otm_bol.route.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 5:05:37 PM)**
    This file defines the API routes for OTM Bill of Lading (BOL) operations. Key routes include fetching BOL details by various parameters (`/`, `/:bol`, `/fetch_payload`, `/fetch/:common_key`), exporting Excel data (`/excel_data`), editing BOLs (`/`), generating XML (`/generate_xml`), and sending data to OTM (`/send_to_otm`). A previously defined file upload route (`/upload`) using middleware that referenced an environment variable for a path is now commented out, suggesting a change in the upload mechanism, potentially replaced by the active `/upload_save_edit` route.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\analytics.ts` (Timestamp: 11/3/2025, 6:57:38 PM)**
    This utility file provides crucial functions for the analytics system. It defines `defaultDateRange` for common reporting periods and `replaceValueInQuery` for dynamic SQL column value replacement. The `getUserObject` function fetches user information and can override the user's company context for admin access. `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` dynamically generates SQL `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `dateTrunc`, and `SELECT` clauses for aggregating data by month, week, or quarter. `getExcelSelectedColumns` is a complex function for selecting and ordering columns specifically for Excel exports based on the report name and type. It also includes `isValidDate` for date validation, `dateFilterOnExport` for formatting and filtering date fields in export data, and `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS`, a comprehensive list defining the headers and keys for all potential Excel export columns.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Analytics-Driven Development:** A significant focus on expanding and refining analytics and reporting features is evident across the controller and utility files.
*   **Dynamic Query Construction:** SQL queries are dynamically built based on user input, report types, and desired display formats, indicating a flexible and configurable reporting system.
*   **Date and Time Handling:** Extensive use of date range calculations, validation, formatting, and aggregation (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) is a recurring theme, especially in the analytics utilities.
*   **Data Export Capabilities:** Both the OTM routes and analytics utilities include explicit support for exporting data to Excel, complete with detailed column selection and date formatting.
*   **Modularity:** The analytics controller delegates query logic to specialized builder functions, promoting code organization and maintainability.
*   **User/Company Context:** The `getUserObject` utility and its usage in the analytics controller highlight a system designed to handle different user roles and company-specific data access.
*   **Consistent Timestamp:** All recorded changes occurred on the same date (November 3, 2025), suggesting a concentrated period of development or a single deployment event.

## 7:40:38 PM
The provided logs detail a focused development session on the analytics section of a frontend application, occurring on **11/3/2025**, primarily between 2:50 PM and 6:05 PM. The changes span several React components, focusing on dashboard view management, metric display, and reporting functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`**: This component, responsible for displaying a scrollable list of interactive chips (tabs), underwent the most frequent and granular changes. Updates include:
    *   **Extensive Styling Refinements (2:50 PM - 3:28 PM)**: Repeated adjustments to Tailwind CSS classes for chip dimensions (`w-[180px] h-[40px]`, `min-w-[160px] h-[42px]`, `w-[220px] min-w-[200px] h-[44px]`), border-radius (`rounded-full` to `rounded-lg` then `rounded-md`), shadows (`shadow-[0_1px_3px_...]` to `shadow-[0_4px_6px_...]`), and background/text colors for both regular option chips and a dedicated "New" button.
    *   **Container Width Adjustments (3:01 PM - 3:14 PM)**: The `max-w` property of the main container `div` was frequently modified, ranging from `520px` to `1200px`, and sometimes removed entirely, suggesting responsiveness testing or layout design iterations. A `ml-[-6px]` offset was introduced later (3:27 PM).
    *   **Functional Enhancements**: The `Option` interface was extended to support optional icons (`icon?: React.ReactNode`) for chips (3:09 PM), and the rendering order of the "New" button relative to other chips was swapped (2:57 PM).
    *   **Debugging (6:03 PM - 6:04 PM)**: `console.log` statements were added to inspect `options` and `value` props, indicating late-stage debugging.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**: This toolbar component, active from 2:56 PM to 4:44 PM, integrates key analytics controls.
    *   **Dashboard Management**: It utilizes Redux actions (`setDashboard`, `setGlobalFilter`) to manage the selected dashboard view and filters.
    *   **PDF Export**: A robust `downloadDashboardPDF` function, using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro`, is implemented to capture the entire dashboard content (`#metric-board`) and export it as a landscape A4 PDF, including a logo. Several commented-out versions of this function in the commit history indicate an iterative refinement process.
    *   **UI Integration**: It renders the `ChipsTabView` for dashboard selection and handles opening a drawer for creating new views.
    *   **Icon Management (3:05 PM - 3:25 PM)**: There's a recurring pattern of importing and later removing or changing import paths for various icons (e.g., `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, `PlusIcon`, `PresentationChartLineIcon`, `HiPresentationChartLine`) from different libraries (`@heroicons/react`, `react-icons/bs`, `react-icons/fa6`, `react-icons/hi2`), suggesting an evolving icon strategy or cleanup.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**: Updated between 4:52 PM and 4:53 PM, this component manages the layout and interaction of individual metrics within the dashboard.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop & Resizing**: It implements drag-and-drop reordering of metrics (`moveItem`) using `react-dnd` and allows resizing of metric grid items (`saveSize`), persisting these changes via API mutations (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`).
    *   **Data Fetching**: Includes `fetchSingleReport` for on-demand data retrieval and processing for individual metrics.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Date Range and User Context**: Many services consistently use `defaultDateRange()` for date handling and `getUserObject()` to retrieve `userCode` and `CompanyName`, often passing `companyname` and `access` from query parameters.
*   **Dynamic SQL Query Generation**: A predominant pattern is the construction of complex, dynamic SQL queries within various services and query builder files. These queries frequently employ `DISTINCT ON` clauses for data uniqueness and specific date/time filtering and aggregation logic.
*   **Data Normalization**: The transformation of "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" is a recurring business rule, implemented both in application-level helper functions (`replaceColumnHandler`, `replaceValueInQuery`) and directly within SQL `CASE WHEN` statements.
*   **Debugging Practices**: There's a consistent presence of `console.log` and `logger.info`/`logger.error` statements throughout the code, indicating active development and a focus on logging for debugging and operational insights.
*   **TypeScript Interface Evolution**: Files like `booking.query.ts` and `containerService.ts` show a clear evolution towards stronger type safety, with `any` types being replaced or complemented by detailed TypeScript interfaces for request parameters, customizer objects, and query results.
*   **Modular Architecture**: The system maintains a modular structure, with specific query builders, service files, and route definitions (`analyticsRoutes.ts`, `index.ts`) encapsulating distinct functionalities.
*   **Invalid Date Handling**: SQL queries frequently include conditions to filter out or handle invalid date values (e.g., `'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'`), and a dedicated `dateFilterOnExport` utility function is used for similar purposes in the application layer.
*   **Analytics Reports Variety**: The system supports a wide array of analytics reports, including booking, chassis, container, departure, general, TEU, CBM, KGS, and transit reports, catering to diverse business intelligence needs.

## 8:40:20 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\analytics\methods.js` was updated on `11/3/2025, 3:47:35 PM`.

This file serves as a central hub for analytics-related utility functions and business logic within the frontend application. Key updates and functionalities include:

**Core Logic and Data Processing:**
*   **`metricsPackageHandler`**: This function is crucial for transforming raw analytics metric data. It dynamically determines the chart type (e.g., `Count`, `Stackbar`, `Transit`, `General`), calculates aggregation values (such as total or average based on `calType`), and applies specific formatting. It ensures data is structured correctly for visualization and further processing.
*   **Chart Configuration**: Defines a comprehensive set of available chart options (`allChartOptions` with MUI icons) and categorizes them by type (`chartOptionsByType`), allowing for flexible chart rendering based on the data.
*   **Report Formula Generation (`reportFormula`)**: Dynamically constructs calculation formulas for specific reports, such as determining the difference between dates for "Scheduled vs Actual Transit Time" and other reports using `dateColumns`.

**Excel Report Generation:**
*   **`downloadReportSpreadsheet`**: This is a significant asynchronous function dedicated to generating and downloading Excel spreadsheets. It uses `ExcelJS` to create a structured report.
    *   It meticulously builds the report with metadata like metric name, client, and date ranges.
    *   Headers are dynamically adjusted based on `periodFilter` (month, week, quarter) and `chartType`, especially for `StackedBar` and `transitBar` reports, where it inserts specific "View" columns (e.g., "Actual", "Estimated").
    *   The data population logic is highly conditional, adapting to various report names and chart types. For instance, it handles different data structures for "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (Stacked Bar)", "Containers Shipped (Mbl Wise)", "Total Spend per Month ($)", "Average Transit Time per Month (Days)", and "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD (Stacked Bar +/- 10 Days)", ensuring correct column mapping for different time periods.
    *   It also adds summary rows (Average, Total) based on the report's `calType`.

**Utilities:**
*   **`TruncateText`**: A simple utility to shorten text strings.
*   **`weekDateFormater`**: Formats dates into a "D MMM" string using `moment.js`.

**Recurring Patterns:**
*   **Extensive Conditional Logic**: The code heavily relies on `if/else if` statements to tailor its behavior based on `item.customizer.chartType`, `item.reportName`, and `periodFilter`. This indicates a highly customizable and diverse analytics reporting system handling various report types and display preferences.
*   **`customizer` Object**: The `customizer` object within metric data is a recurring element, acting as a central configuration store for chart type, calculation type, date columns, and report headers.
*   **Date Handling**: `moment.js` is consistently used throughout the file for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates, particularly in `weekDateFormater` and within the `downloadReportSpreadsheet` function for display and aggregation.
*   **Excel Export Structure**: A consistent pattern is observed in building the Excel report's metadata and then populating the main data rows, adapting to different data shapes and column requirements based on report-specific logic.
