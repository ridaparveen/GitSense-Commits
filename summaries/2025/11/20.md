## 12:23:28 AM
Over the course of November 19, 2025, the codebase saw several focused updates primarily affecting booking actions, the booking dashboard, and the introduction/refinement of an ISF (Importer Security Filing) list view.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\actions.js`**
    *   **11:48:44 AM**: Underwent a significant refactoring of the `getBookingActions` function. The original complex nested ternary logic for role-based actions was replaced with a more modular approach, defining reusable action arrays (`bookingActions`, `isfActions`, `hblAction`, `viewAction`, `updateLineBookingAction`, `updateDOAction`) and dynamically combining them based on user access. New "Update Line Booking" and "Update DO" actions were introduced. A temporary label change for "View Details" to "View Details123" was also noted.
    *   **11:49:42 AM**: An action "View ISF List" was added to the `isfActions` array, and the "View Details" label was reverted to its original text.
    *   **11:50:13 AM**: The icon for the "View ISF List" action was changed to `RemoveRedEyeOutlined`.
    *   **11:52:06 AM**: The modal type for the "View ISF List" action was made more specific, changing from `'view'` to `'view-isf'`.
    *   **4:35:35 PM**: A new `getISFActions` function was introduced, initially defining an "Edit ISF" action and incorrectly defaulting to returning `viewAction`.
    *   **4:36:26 PM**: The `getISFActions` function was corrected to return `isfActions` by default.
    *   **4:37:36 PM & 4:37:44 PM**: The navigation logic within the "Edit ISF" action of `getISFActions` was temporarily commented out, replaced by a `console.log` for debugging purposes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\booking\BookingDashbaordScreenExtend.jsx`**
    *   **11:51:49 AM**: Several new imports were added, including components for updating line bookings and delivery orders, and utilities for Excel reporting. The component sets up a dashboard with various booking statistics and configures grid columns with actions managed by `getBookingActions`.
    *   **11:55:12 AM**: The `ISFListDetails` component was imported, indicating an integration point for ISF-related features into the dashboard.
    *   **11:56:31 AM & 11:57:14 AM**: Minor case correction for the `ISFListDetails` import (`IsfListDetails` to `ISFListDetails`).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\IsfListDetails.jsx`**
    *   **11:55:02 AM**: This new component was introduced, initially designed as a form for approving/cancelling ISF with PO, inventory, and vessel details.
    *   **12:03:06 PM**: The component was significantly stripped down, removing detailed forms and shifting towards a more focused ISF list view.
    *   **12:04:58 AM**: A "New ISF" button was added, configured to navigate to the booking form.
    *   **12:12:22 PM**: The component transformed into primarily displaying a `ThemedGrid` for an ISF list. All previous approval logic and related UI components (dynamic tables, radio select, reason input) were removed.
    *   **12:29:09 PM**: Dummy data (`isfDummyData`) was introduced to populate the `ThemedGrid`. The component started utilizing `useAccess` and `GridActions` for column configuration, specifically setting the last column's `renderCell` to display actions via `getBookingActions`.
    *   **4:26:46 PM**: The `useNavigate` hook was imported and initialized, resolving a scope issue for `nav` within `GridActions`. The `setModal` parameter was removed from the `getBookingActions` call in `GridActions`.
    *   **4:36:38 PM**: The `GridActions` component was updated to use the newly created `getISFActions` instead of `getBookingActions`, specifically for the ISF list.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\card\BookingCardItemExtend.jsx`**
    *   **11:59:00 AM**: This component was added to display detailed booking cards, featuring status badges, expandable cargo and container details via `AppPopover`, and an action menu (`NewTMenu`).
    *   **11:59:10 AM**: A minor typo "Container Details :1" was corrected to "Container Details :".

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\agent.booking.js`**
    *   **12:17:56 PM**: The `ISF_COLUMNS` definition was added (though its content is not explicitly provided in the log for this file, its import in `IsfListDetails.jsx` implies its existence). This change supports the new ISF listing functionality.
    *   **General**: This file consistently defines various column configurations for different booking-related tables, using `appDateFormat` for date rendering and conditional action columns.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modularity and Role-Based Access**: There's a clear move towards more modular code, particularly in `actions.js`, by separating actions into reusable arrays and then combining them based on `access` roles (agent, customer, admin), enhancing maintainability.
*   **Modal Interactions**: A consistent pattern of using `setModal({ open: true, type: '...', data: params.row })` is observed for triggering specific modal views with context.
*   **Grid-Based Data Display**: The introduction of `ThemedGrid` and specific column definitions (`BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS_GRID`, `ISF_COLUMNS`) for various data types indicates a strong preference for tabular data presentation.
*   **Feature-Specific Action Functions**: The creation of `getISFActions` distinct from `getBookingActions` highlights an effort to encapsulate and manage actions relevant to specific modules or features (e.g., ISF vs. general bookings).
*   **Debugging and Iteration**: Minor UI adjustments, placeholder data, commented-out navigation, and label changes ("View Details123" then reverted) suggest an active development process involving frequent testing and refinement.
