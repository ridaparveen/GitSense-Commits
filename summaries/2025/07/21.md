# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 10:33:23 AM
The log shows a single code modification on July 21, 2025, at 9:34:31 AM to the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\alc.route.ts`.  This file defines Express.js routes for an API related to ALC (likely an acronym for a specific system or process).  The update involves defining several GET and one POST route.  The routes handle fetching various data, including MBL numbers, payloads, generated data (potentially from different sources indicated by controllers), errors (with grouping capabilities), and ALC cost records.  The controllers (`alcController`, `alcGeneratedController`, `alcRecordsController`) suggest a modular design, separating concerns into distinct logical units.
