# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 10:33:23 AM
The log shows a single code modification on July 21, 2025, at 9:34:31 AM to the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\alc.route.ts`.  This file defines Express.js routes for an API related to ALC (likely an acronym for a specific system or process).  The update involves defining several GET and one POST route.  The routes handle fetching various data, including MBL numbers, payloads, generated data (potentially from different sources indicated by controllers), errors (with grouping capabilities), and ALC cost records.  The controllers (`alcController`, `alcGeneratedController`, `alcRecordsController`) suggest a modular design, separating concerns into distinct logical units.


## 3:31:50 PM
The log shows several code modifications between 2:45 PM and 3:05 PM on July 21, 2025, primarily focused on the `AddNewEnquiryDetails.tsx` component and the `EnquiryTypes.ts` file.

`EnquiryTypes.ts`:  This file defines interfaces for handling enquiry data.  Initially, it contained only `EnquiryValues` (2:45:15 PM) and then `EnquiryFormValues` (2:45:25 PM), both with a `pono` field. Later (3:01:52 PM), `EnquiryFormValues` was updated to include an `enquiry_no` field in addition to `pono`.  This indicates a change in the required data structure for enquiry forms.

`AddNewEnquiryDetails.tsx`: This React component underwent multiple revisions.  Early versions (2:51:05 PM and 2:52:01 PM) show an extensive form with various input fields (`InputBox`, `AppDatePicker`, `AppTimePicker`, `InputDropdown`), and a form submission handler using `useFormik`.  The initial `onSubmit` function was commented out.  There was also an addRow function to dispatch data to a Redux store using `addList`. The UI layout includes MUI components for styling and structure.  Between 2:52:01 PM and 2:54:06 PM, several iterations occurred, mainly involving changes to the value passed to InputDropdown components, switching between `formData.transportaion_mode` and `formik.values.pono`. Finally (3:03:52 PM and 3:05:28 PM), the component was significantly simplified by removing many unnecessary initial values from `useFormik`,  making the form directly tied to `formik.values` and adding the `enquiry_no` input field to match the updated `EnquiryFormValues` interface. The submit button was changed to have `type="submit"`.  These changes suggest a refactoring effort to improve the form's data handling and integration with the `formik` library.  The commented-out code suggests that at some point there was server communication implemented, but was removed or replaced in the final version.


## 4:31:44 PM
The log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\utils\EnquiryTypes.ts`.  Both entries, recorded at 7/21/2025, 4:19:17 PM and 7/21/2025, 4:20:40 PM, contain identical code.  This code defines a TypeScript interface `EnquiryFormValues` with numerous string properties representing fields in an enquiry form.  These fields cover details like enquiry number, customer information, shipment details (origin, destination, dimensions, weight), cargo characteristics, and nominated agent information.  The close timestamps suggest a possible minor code modification or a redundant commit.  There are no significant changes between the two entries.
