# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 10:05:59 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `Tracker.tsx` between 9:57 AM and 9:59 AM on July 30, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling adjustments within the React component.  Specifically, the `sx` prop within the `Stepper` component is repeatedly modified, adjusting the margin and padding of the step labels (`MuiStepLabel-label`).  The changes to the margin-bottom (`mb`) property in the `sx` prop of the Stepper component are inconsistent across the commits, jumping between `mb: 2` and `mb: 6`. There are also minor changes to the padding (`p`) property within the `sx` prop.  The core functionality of the `Tracker` component, which renders a vertical stepper for tracking cargo, remains unchanged throughout these edits.  The component uses `@mui/material` for UI elements and handles different input types (date, text) depending on the step in the process.


## 11:06:59 AM
The log shows a series of changes to the `Tracker.tsx` component, primarily focused on redesigning the UI from a Material UI Stepper to a custom vertical stepper implemented with Tailwind CSS.  The `DateTimePicker.tsx` component also underwent a significant refactoring.

**`DateTimePicker.tsx` Changes:**

* **10:16:49 AM:** The initial version used Material UI's date and time pickers.  The component had extensive prop handling for date and time selection, including formatting and state synchronization.
* **10:19:21 AM:** A major refactoring replaced the Material UI components with custom input boxes (`InputBox`) leveraging Tailwind CSS styling.  The internal state management was changed from a single `dateTime` state to separate `date` and `time` states. The unnecessary props were removed and the component became much simpler and cleaner.
* **10:20:09 AM:** Minor cleanup of the code in `DateTimePicker.tsx`, removing commented-out code.

**`Tracker.tsx` Changes:**

The `Tracker` component's evolution shows a transition from a Material UI based vertical stepper to a custom Tailwind CSS implementation.

* **10:21:54 AM - 10:26:44 AM:**  Multiple rapid iterations involving adjustments to the styling, specifically the width of the component (`w-[696px]` changed to `w-[570px]`) and the positioning of elements within the component.  The primary change was the progressive replacement of Material UI's Stepper component with a custom vertical stepper utilizing Tailwind CSS classes like `grid`, `grid-cols`, and `gap`. These changes adjusted the layout and size of the component and improved its visual appearance. There were several changes focusing on the border styling and the position of action buttons.
* **10:32:19 AM:** The entire stepper implementation is replaced with Tailwind CSS, removing the Material UI Stepper entirely. The step icons are now custom-rendered using `FaCheckCircle` and `FactCheckOutlined` icons.  The individual step content is still managed using the `getStepContent` function.
* **10:35:01 AM:** A separate `TailwindStepper` function is introduced, showcasing a different approach to rendering a stepped interface (this function is not integrated into the main `Tracker` component in this commit).
* **10:35:29 AM - 10:59:09 AM:**  Further refinements to the Tailwind CSS stepper's styling and structure, including the addition of connector lines between steps and adjustments to the step icon size and styling (`w-[19.5px] h-[19.5px]`).  The changes mainly improved the visual consistency and precision of component's appearance and spacing.
* **10:51:01 AM - 10:57:34 AM:** The check icons used in the stepper were changed from `CheckBadgeIcon` to `CheckIcon`,  with size and positioning adjustments. Also the dark background color of check icon is changed from `bg-[#09090B]` to `bg-[#09090B]`.
* **11:00:08 AM - 11:02:06 AM:** Minor refinements to the `getStepContent` function to improve its organization and use of Tailwind classes (specifically in the handling of the step at index 5).  The layout of the InputBox components were adjusted based on grid system to improve the space management.
* **11:05:01 AM - 11:05:41 AM:** The layout for the step at index 5 was again adjusted to better handle the input elements.


The overall pattern is a migration from a Material UI-heavy component structure to one that heavily utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and layout, significantly altering the visual presentation of the `Tracker` component while maintaining core functionality.  The changes to `DateTimePicker` were made in parallel and suggest a similar move toward a more Tailwind-based design and simpler component structure.


## 4:20:44 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `Tracker.tsx` and `CargoDetails.tsx`.  There were also changes made to `booking-coulmns.tsx`, `MblDashboard.tsx`, `OverviewContainer.tsx`, `booking.types.ts`, `common.ts`, and `dummy-data.ts`.

**`Tracker.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component, a React functional component, renders a step-by-step tracker.  The numerous updates between 11:20 AM and 11:48 AM primarily involved styling adjustments (e.g., changes to class names, background colors, border styles) and minor code cleanup. There were no functional changes to the component.  A significant change at 11:48 AM involved removing several unused imports, simplifying the component.

**`CargoDetails.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This React component displays and handles the input of cargo details within a form.  The changes between 11:31 AM and 11:41 AM focused on consistently applying `border-y` styling to the input sections, switching from `border-b` to `border-y` and then to `border-[#F4F4F5]` for several rows.  The final change at 11:47 AM reverted some borders back to `border-gray-300`. This suggests an iterative process of refining the component's visual presentation.

**`booking-coulmns.tsx` (One Timestamp):** This file defines columns for a booking dashboard. The code uses `@mui/x-data-grid` for rendering, and each column configuration specifies fields, widths, alignment, and custom rendering logic.

**`MblDashboard.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component displays a dashboard for MBL (Master Bill of Lading) data.  Modifications between 1:56 PM and 3:06 PM involved:  refining the UI with a search bar, adding filtering and sorting capabilities using a `ClientGrid` component and  `FilterSidebar`, and enhancing the action menu through the introduction of a custom `TMenu` component. The Action column's rendering utilizes the `getMblActions` function from `action.tsx`. The changes to the component's rendering logic, using a custom grid, suggest an attempt at improving the visual presentation and interaction capabilities. The icon for action menu also changed. The file name for export also changed to "Mbl_Data.xlsx" from "MBL_Data.xlsx"

**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component displays an overview of MBL data using cards. The modifications between 1:49 PM and 2:17 PM changed the button text from "New Booking" to "New HBL" in the code, reflecting a change in functionality or naming convention.

**`booking.types.ts` (Two Timestamps):** This file defines types for booking data. A significant change at 2:21 PM updated `MblStatusType` enum values, changing "In Transit" to "Transit" and "At Destination" to "Destination".

**`common.ts` (One Timestamp):**  This file contains common configuration data, including status mappings and other options for UI elements.  The update at 2:23 PM includes defining `MBL_DASHBOARD_STATUS` and `MBL_STATUS` enums that map internal status codes to display names and color codes for badges, aligning with the changes in `booking.types.ts`.

**`dummy-data.ts` (One Timestamp):** This file contains sample data used for testing and development.  The update at 3:07 PM provides dummy data for enquiries, bookings, and MBLs, which is likely used in the `MblDashboard.tsx` component.


In summary, the majority of changes reflect iterative UI refinements, adding functionality (filtering, sorting, action menus), and code cleanup/simplification.  There is also a consistent effort to rename "MBL" to "HBL" in several components, indicating a potential change in terminology or scope of the application.


## 5:19:36 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on two files: `MblDetailsForm.tsx` and `MblContainerDetails.tsx`.  These changes span a period from 4:24 PM to 5:19 PM on July 30th, 2025.

**`MblDetailsForm.tsx` Updates:**

The major changes in this file involve a significant UI overhaul. Initially, the form utilized the Material UI (`@mui/material`) component library.  Over the course of several commits (between 4:25 PM and 4:57 PM),  the components were progressively replaced with a custom Tailwind CSS component set (`@components/common/tailwind_common`). This transition involved changing `InputBox`, `InputDropdown`, and `AppDatePicker` to their tailwind counterparts. The overall layout switched from `@mui/material`'s `Grid` and `Stack` components to Tailwind's `grid` system.  The final commit at 4:57 PM includes a complete form using Tailwind components, a `form` tag, and a properly positioned `submit` button.  Buttons are also changed from `AppButton` to the custom `Button` component from `@components/kit/button`.  The commented-out Material UI code was also removed during the transition.

**`MblContainerDetails.tsx` Updates:**

This component also underwent a transformation from using `@mui/material`'s `Table` component to using the `DynamicEditableTable` component from `@components/common/tailwind_common/DynamicEditableTable` (between 4:38 PM and 4:47 PM). This involved creating `EditableTableColumn` definitions, changing the way data is handled with `formik`, and updating the component's rendering to align with the new table structure. The initial version used a standard table, with individual input fields for each row and cell. The final version uses a dynamic editable table that greatly simplifies data management.  The header names were also corrected to better reflect the data they represent.

**`MblDetailsPage.tsx` Updates:**

Minor updates to this page's component structure occurred (4:26 PM and 4:52 PM). The main change involved the replacement of `<PageWrapper.Right>` with `<PageWrapper.Content>` to better organize the form. In a later commit (4:52PM), type definition was added to `useState` to improve type safety.

**`types/mbl.types.ts` Updates:**

This file contains type definitions for the form data. A new type `MblDetailsFormValue` was added (4:55 PM) to accurately reflect the data structure used in the form.  The `id` property was added to `MblContainerDetails`.  This ensures that the types match the form's structure after the UI refactor.

**`HblListOfMbl.tsx` Updates:**

The `HblListOfMbl` component was updated to utilize the custom `Button` component from `@components/kit/button` and the `EllipsisVerticalIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` in place of `@mui/material` components. The UI was refactored to use Tailwind CSS classes and its layout improvements (5:00 PM - 5:07 PM).  The "New HBL" button was simplified.

**`action.tsx` Updates:**

The icons used in the action menu were changed (5:10 PM - 5:14 PM) and optimized. There's no functional change, only visual updates to accommodate UI style consistency.

**`index.css` Updates:**

The `index.css` file received minor updates to improve the styling of scrollbars (5:17 PM - 5:19 PM) and to adjust the `icon-precise` class, removing unnecessary style attributes and correcting the `width` definition.

**Recurring Elements:**

*   Consistent use of `formik` for form handling.
*   Progressive shift from Material UI to a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom components.
*   Multiple updates to the same files, indicating iterative development.
*   Use of both Material UI and Tailwind CSS components during the transition.  The comments in the code show remnants of the old component structure.


The overall pattern suggests a refactoring effort to migrate the UI from Material UI to Tailwind CSS, while maintaining the core functionality.  The changes reflect a move towards a more customized and potentially more performant UI.
