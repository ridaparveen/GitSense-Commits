# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 10:05:59 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `Tracker.tsx` between 9:57 AM and 9:59 AM on July 30, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling adjustments within the React component.  Specifically, the `sx` prop within the `Stepper` component is repeatedly modified, adjusting the margin and padding of the step labels (`MuiStepLabel-label`).  The changes to the margin-bottom (`mb`) property in the `sx` prop of the Stepper component are inconsistent across the commits, jumping between `mb: 2` and `mb: 6`. There are also minor changes to the padding (`p`) property within the `sx` prop.  The core functionality of the `Tracker` component, which renders a vertical stepper for tracking cargo, remains unchanged throughout these edits.  The component uses `@mui/material` for UI elements and handles different input types (date, text) depending on the step in the process.
