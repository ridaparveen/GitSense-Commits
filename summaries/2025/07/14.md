# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 10:38:49 AM
The provided code represents a React component (`DashboardPage`) displaying a dashboard overview.  The component fetches data from multiple APIs (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`) and renders this data using various UI components such as `Card`, `DatePeriodSelector`, `Spinner`, and `InputGroup`.  Data fetching is dependent on filters and pagination state managed via Redux (`dashboardSetFilters`, `dashboardSetPagination`).

Significant changes occurred between the timestamps.  The first two commits (10:07 AM and 10:09 AM) show minor modifications.  The most notable change happened at 10:16 AM:  the `selectUserSettings` hook was removed, simplifying the state management.  This suggests refactoring of state handling within the component.  Throughout the log, `console.log` statements are used for debugging, particularly to inspect fetched data (`ShipmentData`, `Filtered Deliveries`, and `dateRangeSelecetor`).

The `DashboardPage` component consistently uses `moment.js` for date manipulation and various React icon libraries (`react-icons/fa6`, `react-icons/hi2`, `react-icons/bs`, `react-icons/io5`, `react-icons/rx`, `@heroicons/react/16/solid`).  The code includes loading states (`isCardLoading`, `isShipmentLoading`, etc.) to improve user experience.  The component handles filtering and pagination for the fetched data, updating the state accordingly and triggering refetches.  There is also functionality for creating a new booking (`nav("/app/bookings")`).
