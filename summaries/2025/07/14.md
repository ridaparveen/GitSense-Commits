# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 10:38:49 AM
The provided code represents a React component (`DashboardPage`) displaying a dashboard overview.  The component fetches data from multiple APIs (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`) and renders this data using various UI components such as `Card`, `DatePeriodSelector`, `Spinner`, and `InputGroup`.  Data fetching is dependent on filters and pagination state managed via Redux (`dashboardSetFilters`, `dashboardSetPagination`).

Significant changes occurred between the timestamps.  The first two commits (10:07 AM and 10:09 AM) show minor modifications.  The most notable change happened at 10:16 AM:  the `selectUserSettings` hook was removed, simplifying the state management.  This suggests refactoring of state handling within the component.  Throughout the log, `console.log` statements are used for debugging, particularly to inspect fetched data (`ShipmentData`, `Filtered Deliveries`, and `dateRangeSelecetor`).

The `DashboardPage` component consistently uses `moment.js` for date manipulation and various React icon libraries (`react-icons/fa6`, `react-icons/hi2`, `react-icons/bs`, `react-icons/io5`, `react-icons/rx`, `@heroicons/react/16/solid`).  The code includes loading states (`isCardLoading`, `isShipmentLoading`, etc.) to improve user experience.  The component handles filtering and pagination for the fetched data, updating the state accordingly and triggering refetches.  There is also functionality for creating a new booking (`nav("/app/bookings")`).


## 11:39:01 AM
The log shows updates to two files on July 14, 2025.

**`server.ts` (10:48:32 AM):** This file, the main server file,  underwent significant changes.  Updates include additions to middleware (cors, morgan for development logging, helmet for production security if not disabled by environment variable),  static file serving for uploads and frontend assets (`/t360_uploads`, `/temp-auth/login`, and  `/public`),  and  the setup of EJS templating engine for views located in the `views` directory.  The file uses environment variables (`ENV.NodeEnv`, `process.env.DOC_UPLOAD_PATH`) to conditionally apply middleware based on the environment (development or production).

**`UserService.ts` (10:50:16 AM):** This file contains various services related to user management, added shortly after the `server.ts` update.  Key additions include:

*   `login`: Handles user login, authenticating against a database (`mtr_user_master`) and generating JWT tokens.  It checks for inactive accounts and throws appropriate HTTP errors.
*   `saveUserPreferences`:  Saves or updates user preferences to the `v2_user_details` table using upsert logic.  It uses extensive logging using the `logger` utility.
*   `fetchUserPreferences`: Retrieves user preferences from `mtr_user_master` and `v2_user_details` tables.  Handles the case where no preferences exist.
*   `saveInviteLog`: Saves user invitation logs to the `v2_user_invite_log` table, sends invitation emails via `sentInviteEmail`, and handles potential conflicts.
*   `fetchAllCompanyUser`: Fetches all users associated with a company from `mtr_user_master` and `v2_user_invite_log` tables, including both active users and pending invitations.
*   `userSettings`:  Retrieves specific user settings, namely date format, from the database.

The `UserService.ts` file consistently uses the `query` function for database interactions, indicating a reliance on a common database access layer.  It also employs detailed logging throughout its functions, aiding in debugging and monitoring.  The code uses a consistent error handling pattern using `HttpError` and `next(new HttpError(...))` within the async functions.  All functions in this file consistently use  `IAuthReq` and `IRes` types, suggesting a structured approach to request and response handling.


## 2:51:39 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `t360-backend-v2` project between 12:56 PM and 2:50 PM on July 14, 2025.  The most significant changes are in the `UserService.ts` and `shipmentService.ts` files, reflecting additions and modifications to user authentication, preference management, invitation functionalities, and shipment data retrieval.

`UserService.ts`: This file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on adding and refining functions for user login (`login`), saving and fetching user preferences (`saveUserPreferences`, `fetchUserPreferences`), managing invitation logs (`saveInviteLog`), retrieving all company users (`fetchAllCompanyUser`), and fetching user settings (`userSettings`).  These changes consistently leverage database queries (`query`) for data interaction and utilize logging (`logger`) for tracking.  A minor change involved correcting the return type in `userSettings` to return a single object instead of an array. The changes appear to be iterative refinements of the user management services.


`shipmentService.ts`: This file contains a substantial modification to the `getAll` function, which retrieves shipment data. The changes involve enhancing filtering capabilities (adding `pol`, `pod`, `status`, `fromDate`, `toDate`, `orderBy`, and `cardFilter` parameters) and implementing more sophisticated logic to determine shipment status based on various date fields.  The primary change involved a condition update in the `eta_within_1_week` case in `buildCardFilterCondition`, modifying the comparison from `>=` to `<=` in one instance and back to `>=` in another, possibly reflecting bug fixing or requirements change.  The code utilizes a `SqlQueryBuilder` class to manage the database query construction in a more organized manner and updates the logic to fetch relevant data from multiple related database tables.


`userRoutes.ts`: This file shows the addition of API routes for user preferences, invite logs, user preferences retrieval, and fetching company users.  A commented-out and later re-added route suggests potential testing or debugging of the `userSettings` endpoint.

`utils/user.ts`: This file defines the `sentInviteEmail` function, responsible for sending invitation emails. It uses a `gmail` sender utility and retrieves the base URL from configuration.

`server.ts`: The `server.ts` file was modified twice. The main change involves adjusting the `cors` middleware to specify the allowed origin, first dynamically from configuration and finally explicitly to `'http://localhost:5173'`, indicating a shift in the development environment or deployment configuration.


`package-lock.json`: This file shows a snapshot of the project's dependencies.  The version numbers and packages indicate the project's environment and dependencies used across different services. This is not directly related to the code changes but shows that many changes were made to many files in the project.

The overall pattern across the code changes suggests a focused effort on improving user management and enhancing the functionality of the shipment data API.  The frequent updates to the `UserService.ts` and `shipmentService.ts` files and the inclusion of extensive logging indicate active development and testing.  The changes to the CORS settings in `server.ts` point to adjustments in the development and/or deployment environment.


## 2:51:45 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `shipment-coulmns.tsx` and `shipment-page.tsx`, primarily focused on shipment data display and filtering within a React application.

**`shipment-coulmns.tsx` Modifications:**

Multiple revisions of this file occurred between 12:28 PM and 2:27 PM.  The core changes involve refactoring the code into custom hooks (`useShipmentCoulmns`, `useOverviewDashboardColumns`) for improved code organization and reusability.  Earlier versions used `GET_SHIPMENT_COULMN` and `useOverviewDashboardColumns` as named exports. The functionality remains largely the sameâ€”defining column configurations for data grids displaying shipment information (ID, origin, destination, status, ETA, ETD, ATA, and actions).  The `renderCell` functions for the "Status" field consistently use a progress bar to visually represent the shipment's progress.  Around 1:09 PM, the `eta` field was changed from `params?.row?.eta` to `params?.row?.t49_eta` indicating a potential backend data field change. At 1:11 PM, a significant simplification occurred, removing `useMemo` and directly returning the columns array, reducing the need for dependency array management. Further changes later reverted to using `useMemo` and the  `formatDate` function from `utils/utils.ts` for date formatting, showing iterative refinements.


**`shipment-page.tsx` Modifications:**

This file underwent changes between 12:32 PM and 2:27 PM. The main focus is on the UI components for displaying shipment data, particularly using card components to show average transit time and shipment in transit counts.  Data is fetched via `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` and `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery` hooks.  The component incorporates auto-complete filters for Port of Loading (`pol`) and Port of Discharge (`pod`), with the filter changes dynamically updating the data displayed.  There's a date range selector for refining the displayed data, along with a filter sidebar. The loading state is handled using a `Loader` component.  Importantly,  at 12:38 PM, the import for shipment column definitions changed from `GET_SHIPMENT_COULMN` and `getShipmentCoulmns` to `useShipmentCoulmns`, reflecting the refactoring done in `shipment-coulmns.tsx`. The final version of `shipment-page.tsx` pulls the columns via `const columns = useShipmentCoulmns();` at the beginning of the component demonstrating cleaner structure and better readability.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

* **Date Formatting:** Consistent use of date formatting functions (Initially `appDateFormat`, then replaced by `formatDate` from `utils/utils.ts`) to display dates in the UI.
* **Data Fetching:** Reliance on `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` and `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery` for retrieving data, indicating a centralized data fetching approach.
* **Redux Integration:** Extensive use of `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to manage application state via Redux.
* **Filtering:**  Implementation of filtering mechanisms using auto-complete boxes for `pol` and `pod`, a date range selector, and a filter sidebar.
* **Refactoring:**  A clear evolution from directly exported functions in `shipment-coulmns.tsx` toward custom hooks, showing a commitment to improving code structure and maintainability.  This involved resolving some unnecessary `useMemo` usage.

The changes demonstrate iterative development, with refactoring efforts aimed at modularity and improvements in maintainability. The application is centered around displaying and filtering shipment data using a modern React framework.


## 3:52:11 PM
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within the `t360-backend-v2` project.  The most significant changes revolve around report generation and user management functionalities.

**`config/config.ts` (7/14/2025, 2:53:57 PM):** This file was updated once to define configuration settings for different environments (development, production, test), specifying base URLs for client and backend, and email recipients for booking notifications.

**`src/server.ts` (7/14/2025, 2:54:47 PM and 7/14/2025, 2:55:57 PM):** This file, the main server file, underwent two minor modifications. The only notable difference between the two commits is the removal of `Client_base_url_dev` from the `allowedOrigin` variable assignment. These changes involve setting up middleware (morgan, helmet, cors, express.json, express.urlencoded), defining static file paths, handling login routes (`/temp-auth/login`), and setting up the view engine (ejs) and static directory for the frontend.


**`src/utils/reports.ts` (7/14/2025, 3:18:13 PM and 7/14/2025, 3:28:50 PM):** This file, dealing with report generation, was updated twice.  The changes primarily involve adding robust error handling and input validation to the `saveToXlsx` function within the `internalFunc` object. This function now checks for the validity of input data and `excelHeaderColumns`, logs warnings for invalid inputs, and handles empty header arrays gracefully.  There are no functional changes in the other parts of the file.

**`src/services/UserService.ts` (7/14/2025, 3:32:41 PM):**  This file contains functions for user login, preference saving, fetching, and user invitation management. The changes include improved error handling and logging, using parameterized queries for database interactions, and the addition of new functions for fetching user preferences and company users.


**`src/services/reports/triggers.ts` (7/14/2025, 3:40:13 PM and 7/14/2025, 3:45:42 PM):** This file manages scheduled report generation.  The changes introduce more sophisticated scheduling logic for daily, weekly, monthly, and single date reports.  A significant update involved fetching the user's date format preference from the database to use when sending reports. Also, improved error handling and logging was added.  The `triggerReport` function now handles `pl_no` column differently and adds `etaFilterCondition`. The commented-out `filterObject` suggests potential future additions for more refined report filtering.

**`src/models/common/types/report.ts` (7/14/2025, 3:44:05 PM and 7/14/2025, 3:44:30 PM):** This file defines interfaces for report history parameters and scheduling parameters.  There were two identical commits to this file. The `Schedule` interface now includes `date_format` property.

**`src/routes/userRoutes.ts` (7/14/2025, 3:47:17 PM):** This file defines routes related to user management. It uses the functions defined in `src/services/UserService.ts` to handle requests for saving and fetching user preferences, managing invitations, and retrieving company users.

In summary, the codebase improvements focus on enhancing error handling, improving data validation, and adding new features for user management and report scheduling.  The use of parameterized queries in database interactions enhances security. The repeated commits to `src/models/common/types/report.ts` suggest a possible unintentional duplicate commit. The overall pattern suggests a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow with frequent, small, focused code changes.


## 4:51:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `booking-form.tsx` component between 2:57 PM and 4:47 PM on July 14, 2025, and other files between 3:49 PM and 4:01 PM on the same day.  The `booking-form.tsx` component underwent significant changes related to data handling and form structure.

**booking-form.tsx (multiple revisions):**

* **Initial versions (2:57 PM - 3:00 PM):**  The component was initially a basic booking form using Formik for validation and submission.  It included fields for Port of Loading (POL), Port of Discharge (POD), booking date, and other booking details. A reducer managed autocomplete options for POL and POD fetched using `fetchOptions`.  The `useDateFormate` hook was initially used and later removed and re-added. There was an `useEffect` hook to fetch approximate transit time based on selected POL and POD.

* **Date Formatting Changes (3:00 PM - 3:05 PM):**  Several commits focused on refining date handling.  The `useDateFormate` hook's return value changed from `dateFormate` to `formatDate`, and `appDateFormat` was added and utilized within the `initialValues` of the Formik form, to handle the `booking_date` field.


* **Import statement adjustments (3:04 PM - 3:05 PM):** The `useDateFormate` was removed from the import statements.


* **Autocomplete and Formik Enhancements (4:35 PM - 4:47 PM):**  The most significant change was the modification of the `handleOptionChange` function.  Instead of just updating options in the reducer, it now splits the autocomplete value (assumed to be in "Port Name~Port Code" format) to set both the port name and code in the Formik form using `formik.setFieldValue`. This improves data management and consistency.  Radio button labels were also capitalized for better presentation.


**App.tsx (one revision):** This file shows the routing configuration for the React application at 3:49 PM.  It defines routes for various pages, including login, dashboard, shipments, bookings, and reports.  The routes use an `AuthGuard` component for authentication protection.


**user-settings-providers.tsx (one revision):** A provider component was added at 3:49 PM to fetch user settings using `fetchUserSettings` on mount and make them available throughout the app.


**shipment-coulmns.tsx (one revision):**  This file, modified at 3:51 PM, defines columns for data grids related to shipments.  It uses `useMemo` for optimization and includes custom rendering for shipment status, using a progress bar to show the value.  The date formatting uses the `useDateFormate` hook.


**dashboard-page.tsx (one revision):** This page, updated at 3:52 PM, displays dashboard information, including shipment data, using an `AppGrid`. The date and filter selection was added. It fetches data using `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` and `useFetchCartDataQuery`. Calendar component shows deliveries data of each day.


**shipment-page.tsx (one revision):**  Updated at 3:52 PM, this page shows a list of shipments using `AppGrid` and the `useShipmentCoulmns` hook.  It includes filtering and pagination. Similar to `dashboard-page.tsx`, the date range is shown using `DatePeriodSelector` component.


**user-settings-slice.ts (one revision):**  This Redux slice, modified at 3:52 PM, manages user settings.  It uses `createAsyncThunk` to fetch settings from an API endpoint (`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}/user/get-user-settings`).  Note that the API URL uses an environment variable.


**utils.ts (one revision):** This utility file at 3:53 PM provides helper functions.  `appDateFormat` formats dates, and `parseRawString` cleans and parses raw strings (likely for PO numbers).  `useDateFormate` is a hook returning a date formatting function using the user's selected date format from Redux.


**store.ts (one revision):**  The Redux store configuration is updated at 4:01 PM, adding api middleware and reducers for bookings, shipment details, shipments, reports, user data, and notifications.  It includes a rootReducer to handle logout actions by resetting the store state.

In summary, the most significant changes were made to `booking-form.tsx`, enhancing data handling in the autocomplete components. The other files show consistent improvements in the application's overall data fetching, display, and state management.


## 5:51:31 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `bookingService.ts` and `shipmentService.ts` files, along with the creation of an `enum.ts` file.  The changes span approximately 30 minutes on July 14, 2025.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\bookingService.ts`**: This file underwent two updates. The primary changes involve the `BookingQueryBuilder` class, which is significantly enhanced to handle more complex database queries for booking data retrieval.  The additions include methods to manage different search criteria (like `addSearchClause`, `addFilterClause`, `addDateRangeClause`), query construction for retrieving counts and distinct values, and refined handling of user roles within the `WHERE` clauses for authorization.  The `getAll` function is also modified to utilize the improved `BookingQueryBuilder`, making it capable of supporting filtering and pagination of booking data. The `saveBooking` function was also updated, but the log cut off before the end.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\models\common\enum.ts`**: This file was created and contains an `ShipmentStatus` enum defining various shipment states (In Transit, Custom Hold, Loading, Departed, Arrived, Pending).

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\shipmentService.ts`**:  This file shows four rapid updates, all concentrated within a short time frame.  The major modification is within the `getAll` function. This function now incorporates extensive filtering capabilities using a `SqlQueryBuilder` class. The `SqlQueryBuilder` builds complex SQL queries, handling various filter parameters, user roles (admin, customer, frontoffice, agent), and order-by clauses.  The  `getAll` function also processes the query results, enriching the shipment data with additional information from an "mtr" data source. This enrichment includes updating shipment status based on various date fields (etd, eta, atd, ata) from the mtr data, and potentially handling potential holds.  The logic for determining the shipment status appears to be improved across multiple revisions, with changes to the conditions for assigning different `ShipmentStatus` values. There is also some special handling for customers named "ZIGI USA, LLC".  The updates show iterative refinements to the logic and error handling for determining shipment status.
