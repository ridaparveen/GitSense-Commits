# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 10:38:49 AM
The provided code represents a React component (`DashboardPage`) displaying a dashboard overview.  The component fetches data from multiple APIs (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`) and renders this data using various UI components such as `Card`, `DatePeriodSelector`, `Spinner`, and `InputGroup`.  Data fetching is dependent on filters and pagination state managed via Redux (`dashboardSetFilters`, `dashboardSetPagination`).

Significant changes occurred between the timestamps.  The first two commits (10:07 AM and 10:09 AM) show minor modifications.  The most notable change happened at 10:16 AM:  the `selectUserSettings` hook was removed, simplifying the state management.  This suggests refactoring of state handling within the component.  Throughout the log, `console.log` statements are used for debugging, particularly to inspect fetched data (`ShipmentData`, `Filtered Deliveries`, and `dateRangeSelecetor`).

The `DashboardPage` component consistently uses `moment.js` for date manipulation and various React icon libraries (`react-icons/fa6`, `react-icons/hi2`, `react-icons/bs`, `react-icons/io5`, `react-icons/rx`, `@heroicons/react/16/solid`).  The code includes loading states (`isCardLoading`, `isShipmentLoading`, etc.) to improve user experience.  The component handles filtering and pagination for the fetched data, updating the state accordingly and triggering refetches.  There is also functionality for creating a new booking (`nav("/app/bookings")`).


## 11:39:01 AM
The log shows updates to two files on July 14, 2025.

**`server.ts` (10:48:32 AM):** This file, the main server file,  underwent significant changes.  Updates include additions to middleware (cors, morgan for development logging, helmet for production security if not disabled by environment variable),  static file serving for uploads and frontend assets (`/t360_uploads`, `/temp-auth/login`, and  `/public`),  and  the setup of EJS templating engine for views located in the `views` directory.  The file uses environment variables (`ENV.NodeEnv`, `process.env.DOC_UPLOAD_PATH`) to conditionally apply middleware based on the environment (development or production).

**`UserService.ts` (10:50:16 AM):** This file contains various services related to user management, added shortly after the `server.ts` update.  Key additions include:

*   `login`: Handles user login, authenticating against a database (`mtr_user_master`) and generating JWT tokens.  It checks for inactive accounts and throws appropriate HTTP errors.
*   `saveUserPreferences`:  Saves or updates user preferences to the `v2_user_details` table using upsert logic.  It uses extensive logging using the `logger` utility.
*   `fetchUserPreferences`: Retrieves user preferences from `mtr_user_master` and `v2_user_details` tables.  Handles the case where no preferences exist.
*   `saveInviteLog`: Saves user invitation logs to the `v2_user_invite_log` table, sends invitation emails via `sentInviteEmail`, and handles potential conflicts.
*   `fetchAllCompanyUser`: Fetches all users associated with a company from `mtr_user_master` and `v2_user_invite_log` tables, including both active users and pending invitations.
*   `userSettings`:  Retrieves specific user settings, namely date format, from the database.

The `UserService.ts` file consistently uses the `query` function for database interactions, indicating a reliance on a common database access layer.  It also employs detailed logging throughout its functions, aiding in debugging and monitoring.  The code uses a consistent error handling pattern using `HttpError` and `next(new HttpError(...))` within the async functions.  All functions in this file consistently use  `IAuthReq` and `IRes` types, suggesting a structured approach to request and response handling.


## 2:51:39 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `t360-backend-v2` project between 12:56 PM and 2:50 PM on July 14, 2025.  The most significant changes are in the `UserService.ts` and `shipmentService.ts` files, reflecting additions and modifications to user authentication, preference management, invitation functionalities, and shipment data retrieval.

`UserService.ts`: This file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on adding and refining functions for user login (`login`), saving and fetching user preferences (`saveUserPreferences`, `fetchUserPreferences`), managing invitation logs (`saveInviteLog`), retrieving all company users (`fetchAllCompanyUser`), and fetching user settings (`userSettings`).  These changes consistently leverage database queries (`query`) for data interaction and utilize logging (`logger`) for tracking.  A minor change involved correcting the return type in `userSettings` to return a single object instead of an array. The changes appear to be iterative refinements of the user management services.


`shipmentService.ts`: This file contains a substantial modification to the `getAll` function, which retrieves shipment data. The changes involve enhancing filtering capabilities (adding `pol`, `pod`, `status`, `fromDate`, `toDate`, `orderBy`, and `cardFilter` parameters) and implementing more sophisticated logic to determine shipment status based on various date fields.  The primary change involved a condition update in the `eta_within_1_week` case in `buildCardFilterCondition`, modifying the comparison from `>=` to `<=` in one instance and back to `>=` in another, possibly reflecting bug fixing or requirements change.  The code utilizes a `SqlQueryBuilder` class to manage the database query construction in a more organized manner and updates the logic to fetch relevant data from multiple related database tables.


`userRoutes.ts`: This file shows the addition of API routes for user preferences, invite logs, user preferences retrieval, and fetching company users.  A commented-out and later re-added route suggests potential testing or debugging of the `userSettings` endpoint.

`utils/user.ts`: This file defines the `sentInviteEmail` function, responsible for sending invitation emails. It uses a `gmail` sender utility and retrieves the base URL from configuration.

`server.ts`: The `server.ts` file was modified twice. The main change involves adjusting the `cors` middleware to specify the allowed origin, first dynamically from configuration and finally explicitly to `'http://localhost:5173'`, indicating a shift in the development environment or deployment configuration.


`package-lock.json`: This file shows a snapshot of the project's dependencies.  The version numbers and packages indicate the project's environment and dependencies used across different services. This is not directly related to the code changes but shows that many changes were made to many files in the project.

The overall pattern across the code changes suggests a focused effort on improving user management and enhancing the functionality of the shipment data API.  The frequent updates to the `UserService.ts` and `shipmentService.ts` files and the inclusion of extensive logging indicate active development and testing.  The changes to the CORS settings in `server.ts` point to adjustments in the development and/or deployment environment.


## 2:51:45 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `shipment-coulmns.tsx` and `shipment-page.tsx`, primarily focused on shipment data display and filtering within a React application.

**`shipment-coulmns.tsx` Modifications:**

Multiple revisions of this file occurred between 12:28 PM and 2:27 PM.  The core changes involve refactoring the code into custom hooks (`useShipmentCoulmns`, `useOverviewDashboardColumns`) for improved code organization and reusability.  Earlier versions used `GET_SHIPMENT_COULMN` and `useOverviewDashboardColumns` as named exports. The functionality remains largely the sameâ€”defining column configurations for data grids displaying shipment information (ID, origin, destination, status, ETA, ETD, ATA, and actions).  The `renderCell` functions for the "Status" field consistently use a progress bar to visually represent the shipment's progress.  Around 1:09 PM, the `eta` field was changed from `params?.row?.eta` to `params?.row?.t49_eta` indicating a potential backend data field change. At 1:11 PM, a significant simplification occurred, removing `useMemo` and directly returning the columns array, reducing the need for dependency array management. Further changes later reverted to using `useMemo` and the  `formatDate` function from `utils/utils.ts` for date formatting, showing iterative refinements.


**`shipment-page.tsx` Modifications:**

This file underwent changes between 12:32 PM and 2:27 PM. The main focus is on the UI components for displaying shipment data, particularly using card components to show average transit time and shipment in transit counts.  Data is fetched via `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` and `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery` hooks.  The component incorporates auto-complete filters for Port of Loading (`pol`) and Port of Discharge (`pod`), with the filter changes dynamically updating the data displayed.  There's a date range selector for refining the displayed data, along with a filter sidebar. The loading state is handled using a `Loader` component.  Importantly,  at 12:38 PM, the import for shipment column definitions changed from `GET_SHIPMENT_COULMN` and `getShipmentCoulmns` to `useShipmentCoulmns`, reflecting the refactoring done in `shipment-coulmns.tsx`. The final version of `shipment-page.tsx` pulls the columns via `const columns = useShipmentCoulmns();` at the beginning of the component demonstrating cleaner structure and better readability.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

* **Date Formatting:** Consistent use of date formatting functions (Initially `appDateFormat`, then replaced by `formatDate` from `utils/utils.ts`) to display dates in the UI.
* **Data Fetching:** Reliance on `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` and `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery` for retrieving data, indicating a centralized data fetching approach.
* **Redux Integration:** Extensive use of `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to manage application state via Redux.
* **Filtering:**  Implementation of filtering mechanisms using auto-complete boxes for `pol` and `pod`, a date range selector, and a filter sidebar.
* **Refactoring:**  A clear evolution from directly exported functions in `shipment-coulmns.tsx` toward custom hooks, showing a commitment to improving code structure and maintainability.  This involved resolving some unnecessary `useMemo` usage.

The changes demonstrate iterative development, with refactoring efforts aimed at modularity and improvements in maintainability. The application is centered around displaying and filtering shipment data using a modern React framework.
