# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 10:22:33 AM
The log shows multiple updates to components within the `envosys-frontend` React application, specifically focusing on the booking functionality.  The most significant changes occurred between 7:10 PM and 7:38 PM on July 28th, 2025.

**`BookingDetails.tsx` (7/28/2025, 7:10 PM - 7:10 PM):** This file underwent an initial commit, introducing a comprehensive booking details form using `formik` for form management,  `@mui/material` for UI components, and custom components like `SelectBox` and `InputBox`.  The form handles various booking details including booking number, dates, customer and agent information, shipper and consignee details, locations (pickup and drop), and shipment status.  A `Tracker` component is also included, suggesting booking tracking capabilities.

**`BookingDetails.tsx` (7/28/2025, 7:10 PM - 7:10 PM):** A minor subsequent update to this file occurred, possibly a very minor syntax change or whitespace modification as the code remains largely identical.


**`BookingDashboard.tsx` (7/28/2025, 7:12 PM - 7:12 PM):** This file displays a dashboard for managing bookings. It features a ClientGrid to list bookings,  search and filtering capabilities (using a `FilterSidebar` component), and an excel export function (`generateExcel`). The initial commit shows a fully functional dashboard with search, filtering, sorting, and data export features.

**`BookingDashboard.tsx` (7/28/2025, 7:12 PM - 7:12 PM):**  Similar to `BookingDetails.tsx`, another minor update with potentially insignificant changes.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (7/28/2025, 7:13 PM - 7:38 PM):** This component shows an overview of booking data. It includes a time period filter, a button to add a new booking, and displays key booking metrics using cards.  The series of updates to this file involved primarily changes in the UI layout using Tailwind CSS classes. The initial version integrated the overview within a `PageWrapper`.  Subsequent commits modified the structure,  moving the "New Booking" button around, adjusting the styling and button size using Tailwind CSS, notably between 7:32 PM and 7:38 PM.  The final version removed the `PageWrapper` from around the component.  The routing for the "New Booking" button changed from `/app/import/enquiry/addNewEnquiry` to `/app/import/booking/addNewBooking`  in the final version.

In summary, the code changes reflect the development and refinement of a React application for managing booking information. The `BookingDetails` component focuses on detailed entry, while `BookingDashboard` provides an overview and management interface. `OverviewContainer` presents high-level booking metrics and a route to create new bookings.  The majority of changes after the initial commits on each file were focused on UI/UX adjustments and refinements.
