# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 9:37:09 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three files within the `t360-frontend` application between 5:27 PM and 6:57 PM on July 17, 2025.  The changes primarily involve UI components and data fetching/display.

**`HeaderForm.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several minor revisions within a short time frame.  These revisions appear to focus on styling adjustments (e.g., adding `Fsx` and `sx` props to control margins and other styling attributes) within the component's structure.  There are no functional changes evident in the code snippets.  The commented-out code suggests potential earlier implementations using a reducer, which was later removed.  The component uses `@mui/material` components for its UI and fetches data using `ApiManager` for client options, vessel options, and port options via the `fetchOptions` function.


**`CngBookingCardItemExtend.jsx` (Two Revisions):**  The first revision of this component added a `console.log` statement to the `valueFormater` function for debugging purposes. This is removed in the final revision.  The component displays information from a `CngBooking` item, using `@mui/material` and custom components like `CardField`, `AppPopover`, `AppTable`, and `AppStepperExtend`.  It dynamically renders a badge based on the `booking_status`.  The second revision shows no significant functional change, just addition of `Equipment Type` label in the UI.

**`DailyGrid.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This component renders a data grid, likely for daily shipping orders. It uses `@mui/material` components and custom components (`CustomCell`, `NestedTable`).  The component fetches data via  `useShippingOrdersDailyQuery` hook and allows for server-side sorting. The two revisions show no significant functional change or bug fixes.  There are also some differences in the column definitions (`daily_pl_columns`) across revisions, possibly indicating minor adjustments to column display.

**`CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` (Two Revisions):**  This component seems to be a main screen displaying CNG booking information. It shows significant changes.  It uses Redux for state management and fetches data using `useFetchCngBookingDataQuery`.  The component displays data in either card or grid view, selectable by the user.  The component shows stats cards for different booking statuses(new,approved,cancelled).  Significant changes happened in the `bookingData` variable, adding the `booking?.counts?.approved` and `booking?.counts?.cancelled` to display approved and cancelled counts.  There's an implementation using debounce function for assigning agents and other minor UI changes.  A modal is used for assigning agents to selected bookings.
**`CngBookingFilters.jsx` (One Revision):** This component provides filters for CNG bookings and uses Redux to manage filter state.  The component renders filter groups using `FilterChipGroup` component.


In summary, the log shows a series of incremental updates, mostly focused on UI refinements and bug fixes in several React components related to displaying and interacting with booking data.  There was a noticeable improvement to the `CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` component.  The changes are consistent with iterative development and bug fixing.


## 12:36:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `cng_booking.controller.ts` and `CngBookingXMLGenerate.ts` between July 17th and 18th, 2025.  The majority of changes center around the `updateBooking` function within `cng_booking.controller.ts` and the `generate` function within `CngBookingXMLGenerate.ts`.

**`cng_booking.controller.ts` Updates:**

* **July 17th, 7:00:23 PM:** Initial commit showing the `getAll` and `updateBooking` functions, along with related database interaction functions. `updateBooking` handles updates to the `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_container` tables.  Conditional logic is used to update or insert into `agent_booking_vessel` and `agent_booking_container` based on existing record counts.  There's also a `bookingXMLGenerate` function for generating XML data.  The `fetchAgentBookingData` function is used for data fetching, constructing dynamic SQL queries based on various input parameters.

* **July 18th, 9:47:18 AM and 9:48:57 AM:** Minor updates within the `updateBooking` function.  A `containerno` column was added to the `agent_booking_container` table in the update and insert statements.  This suggests a schema change to include container numbers.


* **July 18th, 10:07:36 AM:** Added `ship_name` and `ship_code` fields to the request body and the `updateValues` object in the `updateBooking` function.  This indicates an enhancement to include ship details in booking updates.


* **July 18th, 11:14:01 AM and 11:16:16 AM:**  The `getAll` function was modified to accept a new `dateFilter` query parameter. The `fetchAgentBookingData` function was updated to incorporate this new parameter, adding a dynamic `WHERE` clause based on the value of `dateFilter` ('Weekly', 'Monthly', 'Yearly', or defaulting to all time).  The `updateBooking` function is updated to include the `created_at` field.

* **July 18th, 11:30:52 AM:** No significant changes in this commit compared to the previous version.

* **July 18th, 12:10:06 PM:** The `updateBooking` function is further modified to include the `bookingdate` field in the `resBody` and `updateValues`. The `bookingdate` is formatted using the `AppDateFormate` function before being updated in the database.

* **July 18th, 12:22:41 PM and 12:25:22 PM:**  The `created_at` field is removed from the `updateValues` object in `updateBooking`, likely because `created_at` should not be updated. The `dateFilter` in `fetchAgentBookingData` now filters based on the `bookingdate` column instead of `created_at`. This change reflects a more appropriate date for filtering booking data.


**`CngBookingXMLGenerate.ts` Updates:**

* **July 18th, 10:39:19 AM and 10:39:45 AM:** This file contains a class responsible for generating XML files. No significant code changes are apparent between these two commits beyond minor logging adjustments. The class utilizes the `xmlbuilder2` library to create XML, and it logs the XML generation process and interacts with a database to track the batch log of created XML files using functions like `createXML` and `createBatchLog`.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`).
* Frequent interaction with a PostgreSQL database using parameterized queries for security and efficiency.  This is evident in repeated use of the `query` and `updateQuery` functions.
* Error handling using `try...catch` blocks to manage potential exceptions during database interactions and XML generation.
* Consistent use of moment.js for date and time manipulation.
*  The code heavily relies on `agent_booking_id` for identifying and manipulating booking records across multiple tables.
* The application utilizes a robust logging mechanism (`logger.info`, `logger.error`).


In summary, the codebase underwent several iterative refinements focused on the `updateBooking` functionality by adding new fields (ship details, booking date), adding date filtering capabilities, and improving the accuracy of the date filtering logic.  The XML generation functionality remains largely unchanged, focusing on creating XML files for booking information and logging those actions in the database.


## 12:37:12 PM
The log shows several modifications to the React frontend application for managing CNG bookings.  The changes span from July 18th, 2025, between 9:57 AM and 12:21 PM.

**`actions.js` (9:57 AM):** This file defines actions for interacting with CNG bookings.  The primary change involves conditional rendering of actions based on user access levels (`access?.agentBookingMenu`, `access?.customerBookingMenu`, `access?.adminBookingMenu`).  Agent and admin users can edit bookings, while admins have an additional "Assign Agent" action.  Many commented-out actions suggest features under development or previously removed.


**`cngBookingSlice.js` (11:15 AM):** This Redux slice manages the state for the CNG booking screen. A significant update introduces a `setSelector` reducer, allowing bulk updates to the slice's state.  Other reducers handle filtering, pagination, view toggling, sorting, and data manipulation (add, update, remove) for various lists within the booking data.  The initial state includes properties for view, pagination, filters, sorting, form data, and various data lists.

**`CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` (multiple timestamps, 11:15 AM - 12:21 PM):** This component renders the main CNG booking screen. Multiple revisions refine the UI and functionality:

* **11:15 AM:** Initial commit likely set up the basic structure of the screen, including fetching data (`useFetchCngBookingDataQuery`), displaying data in card or grid view, and handling pagination.  Commented-out code suggests XML creation/upload functionality was considered but then removed.
* **11:17 AM:** Added `console.log("bookingdata",booking);` for debugging purposes.
* **11:19 AM:**  The `bookingData` array, used for displaying booking statistics, was updated to use `booking?.comparisonData?.change` for the `changes` property, dynamically fetching comparison data from the backend.
* **11:20 AM & 11:20:30 AM:** Further refinement of the `bookingData` array:  It now dynamically uses `comparisonMap` to determine `changes` and `comparisonText` for each stats card, offering more flexible comparison text.
* **11:23 AM:** The `comparisonMap` is now created using `reduce` for better readability and efficiency.
* **11:30 AM:**  The date filter select was updated to use the `setSelector` reducer, making it more concise and efficient.

Recurring elements in this file include extensive use of Material UI components (`Box`, `Card`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `Select`, `IconButton`, etc.), Redux actions to update the state, and custom components for the grid, cards, filters, and modals.


**`CngBookingForm.jsx` (12:12 PM):** This component renders the form for creating and editing CNG bookings.  It uses Formik for form management and makes API calls (`useSaveCngBookingMutation`, `useGenerateCngBookingXmlMutation`, `useUploadCngBookingXmlMutation`) to save and send booking data and generate/upload XML.  The form is divided into tabs.


**`HeaderForm.jsx` (12:13 PM):** This component represents the header section of the CNG booking form, containing fields for general booking information. It uses `useEffect` to fetch client options and handles option changes for various fields, such as vessel, POL, and POD, using API calls.

**`cng_booking.js` (12:15 PM - 12:15:44 PM):** This file defines columns for displaying CNG booking data in the grid and card views. The changes made were minor, it seems there were no significant changes made, and the file contains column definitions for different sections of booking data (vessel, cargo, bill of lading).

**`CngBookingCardItemExtend.jsx` (multiple timestamps, 12:16 PM - 12:21 PM):** This component renders individual booking cards on the main screen.  The major changes involve adding checkboxes for selecting multiple bookings for actions and more detailed display of the booking information, displaying multiple fields with CardField.


Overall, the changes reflect iterative development, focusing on improving data fetching, UI presentation, and adding features like bulk actions (assign agent) and more robust error handling. The use of Redux and functional components is consistent throughout.


## 1:37:01 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `cng_booking.controller.ts` file between 12:42 PM and 1:29 PM on July 18, 2025.  The core functionality revolves around managing and generating XML data for CNG bookings.

The most significant changes involve the `getDateRanges` function.  Initial versions used `Date` objects for date calculations (7/18/2025, 12:42:01 PM and later revisions at 1:29:01 PM). A later version (7/18/2025, 1:23:57 PM and 1:25:05 PM) refactored this function to utilize the `moment` library for more robust date manipulation, handling weekly, monthly, and yearly date ranges more accurately, including calculations based on the number of days in a given month or year.  The changes to `getDateRanges` significantly improved date range calculations.

Between 1:11:02 PM and 1:12:57 PM, the `fetchAgentBookingData` function was modified. The initial version was incomplete in the provided log,  but the final version shows  the addition of  `page`, `perPage`, `filters`, `orderBy`, `booking_status`, and `dateFilter` parameters to the function signature, suggesting enhancements in data retrieval and filtering capabilities.  Also, the `QueryBuilder` class, used by `fetchAgentBookingData`, was removed completely between 1:11:51 PM and 1:12:57PM.

The `updateBooking` function remains largely consistent throughout the revisions, handling updates to booking details in the database. It includes conditional logic to either update or insert data into `agent_booking_vessel` and `agent_booking_container` tables depending on whether records already exist for a given booking ID.   A clean function was added to handle empty strings.

The `bookingXMLGenerate` function consistently focuses on generating XML data for a given `agent_booking_id`, using the `cngBookingXmlGenerate` utility. The `createdBy` property of  `cngBookingXmlGenerate` is set based on the logged-in user.

Recurring elements include the extensive use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`), database interactions using parameterized queries (`query`, `updateQuery`, `insertMany`), and error handling within `try...catch` blocks.  The code consistently references several database tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_container_pre`).


## 1:37:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` between 12:46 PM and 1:09 PM on July 18, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the `bookingData` array, which displays booking statistics.

Initially, the `changes` property in `bookingData` was inconsistently sourced. It sometimes used `comparisonMap?.changes` and other times `booking?.comparisonData?.changes`. This was corrected to consistently use the latter in subsequent commits.

A significant modification around 12:56 PM involved changing how the `bookingData` values and changes were obtained.  Instead of using `booking?.counts`, the values (`value`) and changes (`changes`) were derived directly from `comparisonMap`, providing values for "New Bookings", "Approved Bookings", and "Cancelled Bookings" based on data within the `comparisonMap` object which itself is populated from the `booking?.comparisonData`.  This ensures accurate reflection of changes based on the comparison data.


Another change at 1:07 PM refined the data displayed in `bookingData` further. The `changes` property now uses `percentageChange` from the nested comparison data instead of a raw `changes` value.  Nullish coalescing (`??`) operators were added to `value` and `changes` properties to handle potential undefined values for a more robust display, preventing errors in case of missing data.  The commented-out sections containing the `sendXMLToCNG` function remained unchanged throughout.  There were no structural changes to the component's rendering logic or event handlers.


## 2:38:35 PM
The code consists of three main functions within a controller related to ALC records: `fetchErrors`, `fetchDestinationCostRecords`, and `addDestinationCostRecord`.

`fetchErrors` retrieves and filters ALC error details from the `alc_exception` table.  It uses a custom query builder (`AlcErrorQueryBuilder`) to construct parameterized queries, enabling pagination, filtering by various criteria (including `bl_number_master`, `batch_run_date`, `category`, `sku`), and ordering.  The query excludes errors of type 'SKIP DUTY ERROR'.  The function also fetches error counts grouped by error type.  This function was updated at 7/18/2025, 1:38:43 PM.

`fetchDestinationCostRecords` retrieves destination cost records from the `destination_cost` table.  It allows filtering by a keyword search across several columns (`destination`, `drayage`, `ord_costs`, `seafreight`, `total_alc_logistics_cost`).  Pagination is implemented using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses.

`addDestinationCostRecord` inserts a new record into the `destination_cost` table.  It handles parsing numerical fields (`drayage`, `ord_costs`, `seafreight`, `total_alc_logistics_cost`) and provides a success or error response.

A common pattern is the use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) for database interactions and comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks.  Extensive logging using `logger.info` and `logger.error` is present throughout.  The code utilizes a custom query builder class for flexible query construction.  There is a significant reliance on PostgreSQL's `ILIKE` operator for case-insensitive string matching and the use of parameterized queries to improve security and efficiency.


## 3:38:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `user-settings-slice.ts` and `vite.config.ts` on July 18, 2025.

`user-settings-slice.ts` underwent several changes primarily focused on the API endpoint used to fetch user settings.  Initially (2:43 PM and 2:59 PM), the code directly used  `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}/user/get-user-settings` for fetching data.  At 3:09 PM, this was modified to `/api/user/get-user-settings`, likely reflecting a change in proxy configuration within the Vite configuration.  Finally, at 3:11 PM the original `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}/user/get-user-settings` was reverted.  The code itself within the `fetchUserSettings` function remained largely consistent throughout these revisions, handling authentication (`token` and `authtype` from localStorage), error checking, and data parsing. The function fetches user settings from an API endpoint, handles potential errors and returns the date_format setting.

`vite.config.ts` was modified twice.  Initially (3:09 PM), a proxy configuration was added to forward requests from `/api` to a URL specified by `env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`. The `rewrite` function also removed the `/api` prefix from the path, making the proxy transparent to the client.  This proxy configuration was then removed (3:11 PM), suggesting a change in the deployment or API access strategy.  No other changes were made to the file, which contains configurations for Vite, a build tool, using plugins for React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript path resolution.


## 3:38:23 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the backend server code (`server.ts`) and the user service (`UserService.ts`), along with the creation of a CORS middleware file (`dateRangeMiddleware.ts`).

**`server.ts` Changes:**

The `server.ts` file underwent several iterations focused primarily on CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration. Initially, a basic CORS configuration was implemented.  Subsequently,  a dedicated `corsMiddleware` function was created and imported from `dateRangeMiddleware.ts`,  replacing and refining the initial CORS setup.  There were several commits related to the positioning of  `corsMiddleware` relative to other middleware within the server's middleware stack. Finally, the original simple `cors()` middleware was either removed or commented out, leaving only the custom `corsMiddleware` in charge of handling CORS requests.  These changes happened between 2:49 PM and 2:55 PM.  Later, at 3:15 PM, the code reverted back to the simpler cors implementation removing the custom middleware altogether.

**`dateRangeMiddleware.ts` Changes:**

This file was created to encapsulate the CORS middleware logic.  The initial version allowed only one specific origin.  It then evolved to support multiple allowed origins and to dynamically check the `Origin` header of incoming requests, thereby improving the flexibility and security of the CORS handling. These changes happened between 2:52 PM and 2:55 PM.

**`UserService.ts` Changes:**

This file contains the user service logic.  Significant changes happened between 3:31 PM and 3:37 PM. The primary change involves the `login` function. The SQL query used for user authentication was modified to include a `LEFT JOIN` with the `v2_user_details` table, allowing retrieval of the `date_format` setting along with user credentials.  This addition occurred between 3:31 PM and 3:37 PM, making the query more efficient.  The rest of the changes were minor formatting adjustments or were not content related.


In summary, the key theme across all changes was improving CORS handling for the backend and enhancing the login functionality to include user settings directly in the response.  The use of parameterized queries in `UserService.ts` suggests an attempt to improve database security.
