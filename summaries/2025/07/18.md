# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 9:37:09 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three files within the `t360-frontend` application between 5:27 PM and 6:57 PM on July 17, 2025.  The changes primarily involve UI components and data fetching/display.

**`HeaderForm.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several minor revisions within a short time frame.  These revisions appear to focus on styling adjustments (e.g., adding `Fsx` and `sx` props to control margins and other styling attributes) within the component's structure.  There are no functional changes evident in the code snippets.  The commented-out code suggests potential earlier implementations using a reducer, which was later removed.  The component uses `@mui/material` components for its UI and fetches data using `ApiManager` for client options, vessel options, and port options via the `fetchOptions` function.


**`CngBookingCardItemExtend.jsx` (Two Revisions):**  The first revision of this component added a `console.log` statement to the `valueFormater` function for debugging purposes. This is removed in the final revision.  The component displays information from a `CngBooking` item, using `@mui/material` and custom components like `CardField`, `AppPopover`, `AppTable`, and `AppStepperExtend`.  It dynamically renders a badge based on the `booking_status`.  The second revision shows no significant functional change, just addition of `Equipment Type` label in the UI.

**`DailyGrid.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This component renders a data grid, likely for daily shipping orders. It uses `@mui/material` components and custom components (`CustomCell`, `NestedTable`).  The component fetches data via  `useShippingOrdersDailyQuery` hook and allows for server-side sorting. The two revisions show no significant functional change or bug fixes.  There are also some differences in the column definitions (`daily_pl_columns`) across revisions, possibly indicating minor adjustments to column display.

**`CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` (Two Revisions):**  This component seems to be a main screen displaying CNG booking information. It shows significant changes.  It uses Redux for state management and fetches data using `useFetchCngBookingDataQuery`.  The component displays data in either card or grid view, selectable by the user.  The component shows stats cards for different booking statuses(new,approved,cancelled).  Significant changes happened in the `bookingData` variable, adding the `booking?.counts?.approved` and `booking?.counts?.cancelled` to display approved and cancelled counts.  There's an implementation using debounce function for assigning agents and other minor UI changes.  A modal is used for assigning agents to selected bookings.
**`CngBookingFilters.jsx` (One Revision):** This component provides filters for CNG bookings and uses Redux to manage filter state.  The component renders filter groups using `FilterChipGroup` component.


In summary, the log shows a series of incremental updates, mostly focused on UI refinements and bug fixes in several React components related to displaying and interacting with booking data.  There was a noticeable improvement to the `CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` component.  The changes are consistent with iterative development and bug fixing.


## 12:36:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `cng_booking.controller.ts` and `CngBookingXMLGenerate.ts` between July 17th and 18th, 2025.  The majority of changes center around the `updateBooking` function within `cng_booking.controller.ts` and the `generate` function within `CngBookingXMLGenerate.ts`.

**`cng_booking.controller.ts` Updates:**

* **July 17th, 7:00:23 PM:** Initial commit showing the `getAll` and `updateBooking` functions, along with related database interaction functions. `updateBooking` handles updates to the `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_container` tables.  Conditional logic is used to update or insert into `agent_booking_vessel` and `agent_booking_container` based on existing record counts.  There's also a `bookingXMLGenerate` function for generating XML data.  The `fetchAgentBookingData` function is used for data fetching, constructing dynamic SQL queries based on various input parameters.

* **July 18th, 9:47:18 AM and 9:48:57 AM:** Minor updates within the `updateBooking` function.  A `containerno` column was added to the `agent_booking_container` table in the update and insert statements.  This suggests a schema change to include container numbers.


* **July 18th, 10:07:36 AM:** Added `ship_name` and `ship_code` fields to the request body and the `updateValues` object in the `updateBooking` function.  This indicates an enhancement to include ship details in booking updates.


* **July 18th, 11:14:01 AM and 11:16:16 AM:**  The `getAll` function was modified to accept a new `dateFilter` query parameter. The `fetchAgentBookingData` function was updated to incorporate this new parameter, adding a dynamic `WHERE` clause based on the value of `dateFilter` ('Weekly', 'Monthly', 'Yearly', or defaulting to all time).  The `updateBooking` function is updated to include the `created_at` field.

* **July 18th, 11:30:52 AM:** No significant changes in this commit compared to the previous version.

* **July 18th, 12:10:06 PM:** The `updateBooking` function is further modified to include the `bookingdate` field in the `resBody` and `updateValues`. The `bookingdate` is formatted using the `AppDateFormate` function before being updated in the database.

* **July 18th, 12:22:41 PM and 12:25:22 PM:**  The `created_at` field is removed from the `updateValues` object in `updateBooking`, likely because `created_at` should not be updated. The `dateFilter` in `fetchAgentBookingData` now filters based on the `bookingdate` column instead of `created_at`. This change reflects a more appropriate date for filtering booking data.


**`CngBookingXMLGenerate.ts` Updates:**

* **July 18th, 10:39:19 AM and 10:39:45 AM:** This file contains a class responsible for generating XML files. No significant code changes are apparent between these two commits beyond minor logging adjustments. The class utilizes the `xmlbuilder2` library to create XML, and it logs the XML generation process and interacts with a database to track the batch log of created XML files using functions like `createXML` and `createBatchLog`.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`).
* Frequent interaction with a PostgreSQL database using parameterized queries for security and efficiency.  This is evident in repeated use of the `query` and `updateQuery` functions.
* Error handling using `try...catch` blocks to manage potential exceptions during database interactions and XML generation.
* Consistent use of moment.js for date and time manipulation.
*  The code heavily relies on `agent_booking_id` for identifying and manipulating booking records across multiple tables.
* The application utilizes a robust logging mechanism (`logger.info`, `logger.error`).


In summary, the codebase underwent several iterative refinements focused on the `updateBooking` functionality by adding new fields (ship details, booking date), adding date filtering capabilities, and improving the accuracy of the date filtering logic.  The XML generation functionality remains largely unchanged, focusing on creating XML files for booking information and logging those actions in the database.
