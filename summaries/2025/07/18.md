# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 9:37:09 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three files within the `t360-frontend` application between 5:27 PM and 6:57 PM on July 17, 2025.  The changes primarily involve UI components and data fetching/display.

**`HeaderForm.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several minor revisions within a short time frame.  These revisions appear to focus on styling adjustments (e.g., adding `Fsx` and `sx` props to control margins and other styling attributes) within the component's structure.  There are no functional changes evident in the code snippets.  The commented-out code suggests potential earlier implementations using a reducer, which was later removed.  The component uses `@mui/material` components for its UI and fetches data using `ApiManager` for client options, vessel options, and port options via the `fetchOptions` function.


**`CngBookingCardItemExtend.jsx` (Two Revisions):**  The first revision of this component added a `console.log` statement to the `valueFormater` function for debugging purposes. This is removed in the final revision.  The component displays information from a `CngBooking` item, using `@mui/material` and custom components like `CardField`, `AppPopover`, `AppTable`, and `AppStepperExtend`.  It dynamically renders a badge based on the `booking_status`.  The second revision shows no significant functional change, just addition of `Equipment Type` label in the UI.

**`DailyGrid.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This component renders a data grid, likely for daily shipping orders. It uses `@mui/material` components and custom components (`CustomCell`, `NestedTable`).  The component fetches data via  `useShippingOrdersDailyQuery` hook and allows for server-side sorting. The two revisions show no significant functional change or bug fixes.  There are also some differences in the column definitions (`daily_pl_columns`) across revisions, possibly indicating minor adjustments to column display.

**`CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` (Two Revisions):**  This component seems to be a main screen displaying CNG booking information. It shows significant changes.  It uses Redux for state management and fetches data using `useFetchCngBookingDataQuery`.  The component displays data in either card or grid view, selectable by the user.  The component shows stats cards for different booking statuses(new,approved,cancelled).  Significant changes happened in the `bookingData` variable, adding the `booking?.counts?.approved` and `booking?.counts?.cancelled` to display approved and cancelled counts.  There's an implementation using debounce function for assigning agents and other minor UI changes.  A modal is used for assigning agents to selected bookings.
**`CngBookingFilters.jsx` (One Revision):** This component provides filters for CNG bookings and uses Redux to manage filter state.  The component renders filter groups using `FilterChipGroup` component.


In summary, the log shows a series of incremental updates, mostly focused on UI refinements and bug fixes in several React components related to displaying and interacting with booking data.  There was a noticeable improvement to the `CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` component.  The changes are consistent with iterative development and bug fixing.
