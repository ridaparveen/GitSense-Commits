# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 9:42:47 AM
The log shows significant development on July 21st and 22nd, 2025, focusing on several React components within an Envosys frontend application.

**`EnquiryContainerList.tsx`**: This component, updated twice with minor code changes at 6:33 PM and 6:35 PM, manages a list of enquiry containers.  Key features include adding, deleting, and updating rows in a table, along with computing total package count and volume.  The changes between the two timestamps are insignificant, removing a seemingly unnecessary `// unique` comment from the `newRow` object in `addRow` function.


**`AddNewVessel.tsx`**: This component, updated twice with minor changes between 10:09 PM and 10:10 PM,  is a form for adding or editing vessel details.  It uses Formik for form management and Yup for validation. The changes between the two timestamps involved adding a debug `console.log` statement to show form values.

**`StuffingTypes.ts`**: This file, updated at 10:19 PM, defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures related to stuffing operations, including `ShippingBillFromRowPlan`, `ShippingBillToRowPlan`, and `StuffingFormValues`.

**`NewStuffingForm.tsx`**: This component undergoes extensive changes throughout the log (10:23 PM, 10:23 PM, 10:28 PM, 10:29 PM, 10:30 PM, 10:30 PM, 10:31 PM). It's a form for adding new stuffing information.  The primary updates involve adding Formik and error handling to the various input fields (`routing_no`, `container_no`, `size_type`, `custom_seal_no`, `agent_seal_no`, `vessal`, `voyage`), and then replacing the `agent_seal_no` fields with  correct names in Autocomplete and InputBox components. Finally, the `AppDatePicker` component receives necessary props for proper functionality, and the `ShippingBillFromPlan` and `ShippingBillFromCartingPlan` components are integrated, passing the `formik` prop.  The final versions of this file (7/22/2025) further refines the Autocomplete components for "Routing", "Container No", "Vessal", and "Voyage" by adding `list` props and integrating the `onSelect` handler to correctly update the Formik values. An `AppDatePicker` component is also added for the "Stuffing Date" field.

**`ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx`**:  Created at 11:46 PM, this component renders a table for managing shipping bills (from box plan), allowing for adding, deleting, and updating rows using Formik.

**`ShippingBillFromCartingPlan.tsx`**: Created and updated twice (11:48 PM and 11:49 PM), this component is nearly identical to `ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx`, but manages shipping bills carted after the plan. The second update changes the `shippingBillFromList` to `shippingBillToList` to accurately reflect what the table represents.

**`AutoComplete.tsx`**: Created at 11:54 PM, this component is a custom Autocomplete component with a loading indicator and search icon.

The overall pattern is the extensive use of Formik and MUI components for creating dynamic and interactive forms within a React application.  There's a recurring theme of adding, deleting, and updating rows in tables, managed efficiently by Formik's `setFieldValue` function.  The later modifications in `NewStuffingForm.tsx` show a clear progression towards a more polished and functional form with better error handling and data management.  The introduction of `routingOptions` array suggests the implementation of data fetching or filtering capabilities is planned.


## 11:42:41 AM
The log shows modifications to React components related to a stuffing form and a vessel form, along with supporting type definitions.

The `NewStuffingForm.tsx` component underwent several minor revisions between 10:48 AM and 10:51 AM. These changes primarily involved refining the `onSelect` handlers within the `AutoComplete` components, removing redundant `onChange` handlers.  No functional changes were introduced.

At 10:53 AM and 10:54 AM,  `ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx` and `ShippingBillFromCartingPlan.tsx` were updated. These components, which manage tables of shipping bill information, were essentially identical except for the title and the name of the formik field they update (`shippingBillFromList` vs. `shippingBillToList`). Both components now include functionality to add, delete, and update rows in their respective tables.  The only difference between the two timestamps for `ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx` is an inconsequential whitespace change.

A `AddNewVessel.tsx` component was added at 10:55 AM. This component is a form for adding or editing vessel details using Formik and Yup for validation. It includes fields for vessel name, line name, IGM vessel code, IMO code, and other relevant information. A status selection is integrated into the component's header.


Finally, at 10:56 AM and 11:42 AM, type definitions were added in `StuffingTypes.ts` and `BookingType.ts` respectively. `StuffingTypes.ts` defines interfaces for rows in shipping bill tables and the overall stuffing form values. `BookingType.ts` defines a comprehensive interface (`BookingFormValues`) for a booking form, encompassing cargo details, sales rates, and facility details.
