# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 9:42:47 AM
The log shows significant development on July 21st and 22nd, 2025, focusing on several React components within an Envosys frontend application.

**`EnquiryContainerList.tsx`**: This component, updated twice with minor code changes at 6:33 PM and 6:35 PM, manages a list of enquiry containers.  Key features include adding, deleting, and updating rows in a table, along with computing total package count and volume.  The changes between the two timestamps are insignificant, removing a seemingly unnecessary `// unique` comment from the `newRow` object in `addRow` function.


**`AddNewVessel.tsx`**: This component, updated twice with minor changes between 10:09 PM and 10:10 PM,  is a form for adding or editing vessel details.  It uses Formik for form management and Yup for validation. The changes between the two timestamps involved adding a debug `console.log` statement to show form values.

**`StuffingTypes.ts`**: This file, updated at 10:19 PM, defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures related to stuffing operations, including `ShippingBillFromRowPlan`, `ShippingBillToRowPlan`, and `StuffingFormValues`.

**`NewStuffingForm.tsx`**: This component undergoes extensive changes throughout the log (10:23 PM, 10:23 PM, 10:28 PM, 10:29 PM, 10:30 PM, 10:30 PM, 10:31 PM). It's a form for adding new stuffing information.  The primary updates involve adding Formik and error handling to the various input fields (`routing_no`, `container_no`, `size_type`, `custom_seal_no`, `agent_seal_no`, `vessal`, `voyage`), and then replacing the `agent_seal_no` fields with  correct names in Autocomplete and InputBox components. Finally, the `AppDatePicker` component receives necessary props for proper functionality, and the `ShippingBillFromPlan` and `ShippingBillFromCartingPlan` components are integrated, passing the `formik` prop.  The final versions of this file (7/22/2025) further refines the Autocomplete components for "Routing", "Container No", "Vessal", and "Voyage" by adding `list` props and integrating the `onSelect` handler to correctly update the Formik values. An `AppDatePicker` component is also added for the "Stuffing Date" field.

**`ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx`**:  Created at 11:46 PM, this component renders a table for managing shipping bills (from box plan), allowing for adding, deleting, and updating rows using Formik.

**`ShippingBillFromCartingPlan.tsx`**: Created and updated twice (11:48 PM and 11:49 PM), this component is nearly identical to `ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx`, but manages shipping bills carted after the plan. The second update changes the `shippingBillFromList` to `shippingBillToList` to accurately reflect what the table represents.

**`AutoComplete.tsx`**: Created at 11:54 PM, this component is a custom Autocomplete component with a loading indicator and search icon.

The overall pattern is the extensive use of Formik and MUI components for creating dynamic and interactive forms within a React application.  There's a recurring theme of adding, deleting, and updating rows in tables, managed efficiently by Formik's `setFieldValue` function.  The later modifications in `NewStuffingForm.tsx` show a clear progression towards a more polished and functional form with better error handling and data management.  The introduction of `routingOptions` array suggests the implementation of data fetching or filtering capabilities is planned.


## 11:42:41 AM
The log shows modifications to React components related to a stuffing form and a vessel form, along with supporting type definitions.

The `NewStuffingForm.tsx` component underwent several minor revisions between 10:48 AM and 10:51 AM. These changes primarily involved refining the `onSelect` handlers within the `AutoComplete` components, removing redundant `onChange` handlers.  No functional changes were introduced.

At 10:53 AM and 10:54 AM,  `ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx` and `ShippingBillFromCartingPlan.tsx` were updated. These components, which manage tables of shipping bill information, were essentially identical except for the title and the name of the formik field they update (`shippingBillFromList` vs. `shippingBillToList`). Both components now include functionality to add, delete, and update rows in their respective tables.  The only difference between the two timestamps for `ShippingBillFromPlan.tsx` is an inconsequential whitespace change.

A `AddNewVessel.tsx` component was added at 10:55 AM. This component is a form for adding or editing vessel details using Formik and Yup for validation. It includes fields for vessel name, line name, IGM vessel code, IMO code, and other relevant information. A status selection is integrated into the component's header.


Finally, at 10:56 AM and 11:42 AM, type definitions were added in `StuffingTypes.ts` and `BookingType.ts` respectively. `StuffingTypes.ts` defines interfaces for rows in shipping bill tables and the overall stuffing form values. `BookingType.ts` defines a comprehensive interface (`BookingFormValues`) for a booking form, encompassing cargo details, sales rates, and facility details.


## 12:42:48 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple React component files within an Envosys frontend application.  The core functionality involves building forms for booking and enquiry management.

**`BookingType.ts` (7/22/2025, 11:47:41 AM):** This file defines TypeScript interfaces (`cargoDetailsList`, `salesRateList`, `facList`, and `BookingFormValues`) outlining the structure of data used in booking forms.  These interfaces encompass various details about cargo, sales rates, and financial aspects, including addresses, contact information, and shipment specifics.

**`BookingDetails.tsx` (7/22/2025, 11:50:27 AM - 7/22/2025, 12:12:43 PM):** This component displays and manages booking details.  Multiple revisions occurred between 11:50:27 AM and 12:12:43 PM.  The key change involves integrating the `formik` library for form management. Initially, the form components lacked integration with `formik`. Subsequent updates added `formik.values`, `formik.handleChange`, and `formik.errors` to input fields, enabling form state management and validation.  The component also includes a tracking functionality using a `Tracker` component, showing steps in the booking process. The component uses `@mui/material` for UI elements.

**`AddNewEnquiryDetails.tsx` (7/22/2025, 12:14:20 PM):**  This component is very similar in structure to `BookingDetails.tsx` but handles enquiry details. It uses `formik` for form handling, `@mui/material` for UI elements, and includes sections for container lists, data grids, and navigation details.  It also defines transportation options (Ocean and Air).  The structure closely mirrors `BookingDetails.tsx`, suggesting code reuse or a shared design pattern.

**`CargoDetails.tsx` (7/22/2025, 12:20:56 PM - 7/22/2025, 12:30:01 PM):** This component, used within the booking form, displays and edits cargo details. The main change between these timestamps was a minor adjustment to the gap between Typography elements in the styling.  It uses responsive design elements (`useMediaQuery`) to adjust layout based on screen size.  It also makes use of `formik` for form handling.

**`SaleRateDetails.tsx` (7/22/2025, 12:32:09 PM - 7/22/2025, 12:34:48 PM):**  This component manages sales rate details within the booking form, using a table to display and edit multiple rows.  Multiple revisions occurred during a short period. Initially, it was using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to manage state via Redux, but was updated to instead use `formik`.  It allows for adding and deleting rows. It makes use of `formik` for form handling, dynamically calculates the total amount, and uses `@mui/material` components.

**`FacDetails.tsx` (7/22/2025, 12:39:38 PM):** This component handles financial aspects (`facList`) of the booking, presented similarly to `SaleRateDetails.tsx` using a table for data entry and editing. It uses `formik` for form handling and allows for adding and deleting rows.



In summary, the code changes reflect the development of a comprehensive booking and enquiry management system, leveraging React, Material UI, and Formik for efficient form handling and state management.  A consistent UI pattern is applied across components, with a clear emphasis on dynamic form generation and manipulation.  The use of `formik` significantly improved form handling by centralizing form state management and validation.


## 1:42:46 PM
The log shows multiple updates to components and type definitions within the `envosys-frontend` project on July 22nd, 2025.

`ThemeTab.tsx` underwent several revisions between 1:30:33 PM and 1:30:59 PM.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the component's structure and functionality.  Changes included adding a background color (#fff),  improving styling with sx props, and adding "next" and "previous" buttons controlled by `handleNext` and `handlePrev` functions. The `tabCounts` prop was removed in the final version.

`AppDatePicker.tsx` was updated at 1:23:23 PM. The main change was refactoring the component to use TypeScript interfaces (`AppDatePickerProps`) for better type safety and improving prop handling, especially error and helperText props.  Previously commented-out code was removed, indicating a cleanup or simplification of the component.

`ThemeTabContext.tsx` was created at 1:31:13 PM, introducing a context for managing tab navigation within the `ThemeTabs` component.  This context provides functions for navigating between tabs and tracking the currently selected tab.

`Tracker.tsx` contained commented-out code at 1:31:36 PM, suggesting a component under development or temporarily disabled. The commented-out code indicated a more complex stepper component with date and input fields.

Several type definition files (`BookingType.ts`, `StuffingTypes.ts`, `EnquiryTypes.ts`, `booking.types.ts`, `enquiry.types.ts`, `stuffing.types.ts`) were updated between 1:38:28 PM and 1:40:19 PM. These updates define interfaces for various form values and data structures used throughout the application, indicating a focus on data modeling and type consistency.  The `BookingFormValues` and `EnquiryFormValues` interfaces show significant detail for booking and enquiry data.

`BookingDetails.tsx` (updated at 1:40:46 PM) utilizes `formik` for form management and incorporates various components, including `ThemeTabs`, `InputBox`, `AppDatePicker`, `CargoDetails`, `SaleRateDetails`, and `FacDetails`. The component displays a detailed booking form, demonstrating the integration of previously defined types and components.

`CargoDetails.tsx` and `SaleRateDetails.tsx` (updated at 1:41:06 PM and 1:41:18 PM respectively) are components designed to handle nested form data, specifically details of cargo and sales rates for a booking form. They make use of `formik` for form management and dynamically render form fields based on the data structure.  They also include responsive design considerations based on screen size.

`FacDetails.tsx` (updated at 1:41:25 PM) is another form component, similar in structure to `CargoDetails.tsx` and `SaleRateDetails.tsx`, focusing on handling a table of facility-related details.

In summary, the code changes reflect the development of a complex frontend application for managing bookings, enquiries and stuffing. The changes demonstrate a shift towards using TypeScript for type safety,  a preference for component-based architecture with reusable components (like `ThemeTabs`, `InputBox`, `AppDatePicker`), and the use of `formik` for streamlined form handling.  There's a clear pattern of using interfaces to define data structures for various forms, suggesting a well-organized data model.


## 2:42:43 PM
The log shows code changes across three files within the `envosys-frontend` project on July 22, 2025.

**`AddNewEnquiryDetails.tsx` (2:15:57 PM):** This file contains a React component for adding new enquiry details.  It uses Formik for form management and Material UI for the UI components.  The component includes numerous input fields for various enquiry details (enquiry type, dates, customer and shipping information, location details, commodity details, etc.), dropdowns, and date/time pickers.  It also utilizes custom components like `InputBox`, `AppDatePicker`, `AppTimePicker`, and `CustomPaper`.  The component renders a form with "Submit" and "Cancel" buttons.  There's a noticeable use of `Stack` and `Grid` components for layout.

**`EnquiryContainerList.tsx` (2:16:21 PM):** This component is a dynamic list of container details, integrated with the `AddNewEnquiryDetails` component.  It allows adding and deleting rows for container dimensions and attributes (number of packages, package type, volume, unit type, dimensions, weight). It calculates and displays total number of packages and total volume. The component leverages Formik's `FormikProps` to interact with the form state, enabling dynamic updates to the container list.

**`AddNewProcurement.tsx` (2:41:20 PM, 2:41:34 PM, 2:41:59 PM):** This file contains a React component for adding new procurement details. Multiple updates were made to this file.  Initially, it included a form using Formik (with `useFormik` and a `StuffingFormValues` type), AutoComplete components for selecting line names, POD, and booking numbers, and a table for container details. Subsequent updates removed the Formik integration completely, leaving only static input fields within the table. The component uses Material UI components for layout and input elements.  The `routingOptions` constant defines a set of routing options for an AutoComplete component.  The removal of Formik suggests a potential shift in how form data is handled within this component.
