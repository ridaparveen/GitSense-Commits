# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 11:36:11 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `dashboard-page.tsx` on July 11th, 2025, between 11:04 AM and 11:34 AM.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the UI and  handling of loading states.

The file consistently uses React hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`), Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), and various API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`).  These APIs fetch shipment and delivery data, influencing the display of the dashboard.

Early revisions focused on the structure and initial rendering of the dashboard, including placeholders for loading states.  Later revisions centered around improving the presentation of loading indicators and  refactoring the `mapCardFilterToStatus` function into a more descriptive `cardLabelMap` object at 11:31 AM and 11:33 AM.  The final revision at 11:34 AM further refines the loading state placeholders within the `Card` component.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  No functional changes to core logic are evident; only UI/UX enhancements.


## 12:36:13 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `dashboard-page.tsx` between 11:41 AM and 12:35 PM on July 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the UI and data fetching logic of a React dashboard.

**`dashboard-page.tsx` Updates:**

Early revisions (11:41 AM - 11:44 AM) involved primarily formatting and minor code restructuring.  There are no functional changes in these commits.  A significant change occurred around 11:43 AM, with the addition of a loading state for cards and the implementation of the `handleCardClick` function, suggesting the addition of interactive card elements. Further modifications between 11:44 AM and 12:20 PM involved minor adjustments to the UI and data fetching logic. Most notably, the `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` now uses `cardFromDate` and `cardToDate` from the `dashboardSelector.dateFilter` object, instead of `fromDate` and `toDate`.  At 12:22 PM, a small UI adjustment was made to add a loading state for a card element. Finally, at 12:32 PM and 12:35 PM, the code was further refined.

**`DatePeriodSelector.tsx` Updates:**

The `DatePeriodSelector.tsx` component underwent changes between 11:46 AM and 11:49 AM.  The most significant update at 11:49 AM improved the display of the selected date range, showing only the selected dates if available, rather than a default placeholder. The date picker functionality itself remained commented out in the code throughout these changes.

**`shipment.types.ts` Updates:**

A single update at 11:58 AM modified the `DashboardState` interface in `shipment.types.ts`. The key change was the addition of `cardFromDate` and `cardToDate` fields to the `dateFilter` object within `DashboardState`.  This aligns with the change in `dashboard-page.tsx` to use these fields for fetching data.

**Recurring Patterns:**

The majority of changes to `dashboard-page.tsx` center around the handling of loading states (`isCardLoading`, `isCardFetching`, `Spinner`), date filtering (`setDateRange`, `setPeriod`, `DatePeriodSelector`), and pagination (`dashboardSetPagination`). This points towards a focus on improving the user experience during data loading and filtering. The consistent use of React hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`) and Redux actions indicates a well-structured React application utilizing Redux for state management.


## 12:36:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `shipmentService.ts` file between 11:51 AM and 12:33 PM on July 11, 2025,  and the `dashboardService.ts` file between 12:11 PM and 12:13 PM on the same day.  The `shipment.ts` file was also updated at 11:59 AM on July 11, 2025.

The most significant changes are within `shipmentService.ts`.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the `getAll` function, which retrieves shipment data.  Initial versions included debugging `console.log` statements which were later removed in subsequent commits. There's also a noticeable effort to improve the handling of status filters and date ranges, adding more robust error handling and clarifying comments.  The  `buildCardFilterCondition` method within the nested `SqlQueryBuilder` class was also significantly modified and improved. The final version removes some redundant date filtering.


The `dashboardService.ts` file underwent minor revisions, primarily involving minor formatting changes and no significant logic alterations in the  `getDashboardCardInfo` and `getDeliveryData` functions.


The `shipment.ts` file update introduced new interface definitions, specifically refining the types for shipment query parameters (`ShipmentQueryParams`), MTR tracking data (`MtrTrackingData`), and query filters (`QueryFilters`).  This suggests a restructuring of data types used in the application.


## 2:15:00 PM
The primary focus of the code changes is on `dashboard-page.tsx`, which is a React component responsible for displaying a dashboard overview.  Multiple revisions were made between 12:36 PM and 1:04 PM on July 11, 2025.  These revisions involved refinements to the component's data fetching, state management, and UI rendering.

**`dashboard-page.tsx` Updates:**

* **Data Fetching:** The component fetches data from multiple API endpoints (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`).  The initial versions included unnecessary conditional rendering of `cardFromDate` and `cardToDate` in API calls. Later revisions simplified the `useFetchShipmentDataQuery` call by removing redundant date filter parameters and ensuring consistent use of `dashboardSelector.dateFilter` across the component.

* **State Management:** The component uses Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) to manage state, including pagination, filters, and sort models.  The `useEffect` hook ensures that if no date range or period is selected, the default is set to "All". The `dashboardSetFilters` action is used repeatedly to update the filters, resetting the page to 0 after each filter change.  

* **UI Rendering:**  Changes involved styling updates (using various class names), the addition of a loading spinner (`Spinner`), and adjustments to how card data is displayed (showing the number of `pending_departure` shipments, updating the card value font size to `text-[36px]`). The initial render showed placeholders while data was being fetched (`animate-pulse` class).  The component displays a date period selector (`DatePeriodSelector`), search functionality, and a "New Booking" button.


**`shipment.types.ts` Updates:**

The `DashboardState` interface in `shipment.types.ts` was modified to remove redundant `cardFromDate` and `cardToDate` properties from the `filters` object, consolidating them into the `dateFilter` object.  This change reflects the simplification in the API calls in `dashboard-page.tsx`.  The change happened between 12:50 PM and 1:06 PM.

**`shipment-dashboard-slice.ts` Updates:**

This file, updated at 1:06:17 PM, defines Redux slices for managing the dashboard state.  It includes reducers for pagination (`dashboardSetPagination`), filters (`dashboardSetFilters`), date range (`setDateRange`), period (`setPeriod`), sort model (`dashboardSetSortModel`), and card filters (`setCardFilter`).  The `setCardFilter` reducer now resets the pagination page to 0.

In summary, the series of changes represent a focused effort to improve the dashboard component's efficiency, maintainability, and user experience by streamlining data fetching and state management while enhancing its visual presentation.  The bulk of the changes were done within a short timeframe (approximately 30 minutes) suggesting a focused development sprint.


## 2:15:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `shipmentService.ts` file between 12:38 PM and 1:08 PM on July 11, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is refining the `getAll` function, which retrieves shipment data.

Initially, the code had a commented-out section related to `cardFilter` in the `SqlQueryBuilder`.  Subsequent revisions removed this comment, activating the `cardFilter` functionality in the `getAll` function.  This suggests the addition or improvement of a card-based filtering mechanism for shipments.

Further modifications centered around the date filtering within the `buildFilterConditions` and `buildCardFilterCondition` methods of the `SqlQueryBuilder` class. There were multiple instances where the `fromDate` and `toDate` parameters were commented and uncommented in the `buildFilterConditions` method.  The final version appears to use the parameters only inside `buildCardFilterCondition`.

Another significant change involved adding a comment "Added multiple filters ****:-" and adding `console.log(status)` statements in the shipment status determination loop, potentially for debugging purposes.  This implies the addition or enhancement of filtering capabilities related to shipment status.


The `buildOrderBy` method within `SqlQueryBuilder` also underwent changes, expanding the list of allowed columns for ordering results to include `"shipper"`, `"mblno"`.


The core logic of the `getAll` function, particularly the processing and updating of shipment status based on various date fields (`etd`, `eta`, `atd`, `ata`) from the `mtrData`, remained largely consistent throughout the revisions.  The code uses conditional logic to determine the shipment's status ("Loading", "Departed", "In Transit", "Custom Hold", "Arrived") and updates the `bookedItem` accordingly.  The use of `moment.js` for date manipulation is evident.

In summary, the revisions reflect iterative development focused on improving the filtering and ordering functionalities of the shipment retrieval process within the `getAll` function, primarily through modifications to the `SqlQueryBuilder` class.  The underlying shipment status logic remained relatively untouched, with minor additions for debugging.


## 3:14:49 PM
The log shows updates to the backend of a system, specifically focusing on user services and API routes.

On July 11, 2025, at 2:33:29 PM, `UserService.ts` was initially committed. This file contains functions for user login, saving and fetching user preferences, managing user invitations, retrieving all company users, and fetching user settings.  The functions extensively use SQL queries to interact with the `mtr_user_master` and `v2_user_details` tables, along with logging using a custom logger.  The login function uses a simple username/password authentication, creating a JWT token upon successful login.  The other functions handle user preference updates (UPSERT operations), user invite logging (UPSERT operations), fetching company users (combining results from two tables), and fetching user settings.  All functions include robust error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.

At 2:54:10 PM,  `Paths.ts` was updated to define constants for various API endpoints, including those related to users (preferences, invites, settings, and company users), authentication, dashboards, shipments, bookings, reports and notifications.  This is a comprehensive definition of all API routes.


At 2:54:51 PM, `UserService.ts` underwent a second commit. The primary change seems to be adding the `userSettings` function to the `all` object and a minor correction in the `userSettings` function, adding `time_zone` and `language` to the SELECT statement.


Finally, at 2:55:00 PM, `userRoutes.ts` was updated to define the express routes using the constants from `Paths.ts` and linking them to the corresponding functions in `UserService.ts`.  This commit maps the API endpoints defined in `Paths.ts` to the services defined in `UserService.ts`.  The routes handle POST requests for saving user preferences and invite logs, and GET requests for fetching user preferences, company users, and user settings.

In summary, the changes reflect a structured approach to building a user management system.  The API endpoints are clearly defined, and the corresponding backend functions are well-organized and include logging and error handling. The use of UPSERT operations suggests an efficient way to handle both inserts and updates.  There is consistent use of parameterized SQL queries, which improves security.


## 3:14:52 PM
The log shows several code changes made on July 11, 2025, primarily focused on improving the Redux store and the application's user interface.  Let's break down the key updates:


**`user-settings-slice.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This file, managing user settings, underwent multiple revisions.  Initially, it fetched settings from `/api/user-settings`. This endpoint was later changed to `/user/get-user-settings`. A `console.log` statement was added to track API response in the final revision.  The overall functionality remains consistent: fetching and updating user settings (date format, time zone, language) using Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` and `createSlice`.

**`store.ts` (Two Revisions):**  This file, defining the Redux store, was modified twice. The first change involved including all necessary reducers and middleware for various API slices and reducers. The second modification simplified the `userSettingsSlice` inclusion in the combined reducer, removing the `.reducer` call, making it more concise. The rootReducer handles logout actions by resetting the state.

**`user-api.ts`:** This file introduces an API slice (`userApi`) using `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. It defines endpoints for fetching user preferences (`fetchUserPreference`), fetching company users (`fetchCompanyUsers`), setting user preferences (`setUserPreference`), and saving invite logs (`saveInviteLog`). Importantly, it uses a custom header preparation function (`getAppHeaders` from `services/ApiMethods`), suggesting secure API communication.

**`App.tsx`:** This component, representing the application's main routing, was updated to include a new route for `/preferences` (PreferencePage).  Crucially, the `useEffect` hook now dispatches `fetchUserSettings` to load user preferences upon component mount, integrating user settings into the application flow.

**`dashboard-page.tsx` (Three Revisions):**  The `dashboard-page.tsx` file went through several iterations. The most significant change is in how it accesses and uses the `userSettings` from the Redux store.  Initially, it incorrectly accessed a specific property (`dateFormat`),  then it tried accessing the entire slice, and finally, it correctly accesses the slice using `userSettingsSlice` provided by the Redux store. The component displays a dashboard with interactive elements, filtering and data fetching,  and uses several API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`) showing data interactions.  Minor UI changes were also made, like the update of the "New Booking" button.



**Recurring Elements:**  A significant recurring element is the extensive use of Redux Toolkit for state management, including `createAsyncThunk`, `createSlice`, and `createApi` functions, pointing towards a well-structured and consistent application architecture.  The consistent use of `moment.js` for date handling is another noticeable pattern.  The application appears to be a dashboard focused on shipments, bookings, and reports, possibly a logistics or supply chain management system.
