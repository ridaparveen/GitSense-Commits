# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 11:36:11 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `dashboard-page.tsx` on July 11th, 2025, between 11:04 AM and 11:34 AM.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the UI and  handling of loading states.

The file consistently uses React hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`), Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), and various API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`).  These APIs fetch shipment and delivery data, influencing the display of the dashboard.

Early revisions focused on the structure and initial rendering of the dashboard, including placeholders for loading states.  Later revisions centered around improving the presentation of loading indicators and  refactoring the `mapCardFilterToStatus` function into a more descriptive `cardLabelMap` object at 11:31 AM and 11:33 AM.  The final revision at 11:34 AM further refines the loading state placeholders within the `Card` component.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  No functional changes to core logic are evident; only UI/UX enhancements.
