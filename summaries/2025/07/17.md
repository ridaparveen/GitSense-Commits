# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:27:42 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `dashboard-page.tsx` and `global.ts`.  The `global.ts` file, updated twice within a short timeframe (10:18:57 AM and 10:19:03 AM), contains definitions for various status and role options, including `SHIPMENT_STATUS`, `REPORTS_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_ROLE`, `BOOKING_STATUS`, `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_STATUS`, and `BOOKING_SORT_OPTIONS`. The changes between the two updates to `global.ts` appear to be negligible or nonexistent based on the provided code snippets.  These options define color codes associated with different statuses using a consistent naming pattern (`bg-{color}-500`).

The `dashboard-page.tsx` file (updated at 10:12:56 AM and 10:21:37 AM) is a React component for a dashboard page.  The updates involve modifications to the UI, specifically the date selection component, and the addition of a "New Booking" button.  The component fetches data using Redux and several API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`).  The code includes extensive logic for handling filters, pagination, sorting, and displaying data related to shipments and deliveries.  The second update to `dashboard-page.tsx` appears to contain only minor cosmetic changes in the code based on the provided snippets and not significant functional changes.  The component utilizes various React libraries and icons for its presentation.


## 1:26:45 PM
The codebase primarily deals with managing and updating booking information, likely for a transportation or logistics system.  The `cng_booking.controller.ts` file contains controllers for retrieving, updating, and generating XML data related to bookings.

Significant updates on **July 17, 2025, at 1:24:45 PM** include the addition and modification of several functions within this controller.  The `getAll` function retrieves booking data based on various filter criteria, including pagination and sorting.  The `updateBooking` function updates booking information in the `agent_booking_entry` table and related tables (`agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_container_pre`). This function handles updates to both existing and new entries in these tables.  The `bookingXMLGenerate` function generates an XML representation of a booking which is then presumably sent to another service.

The code extensively uses SQL queries to interact with a PostgreSQL database.  Several database tables are involved, including `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_container`, and `agent_booking_container_pre`, suggesting a relational database schema designed to store booking details, vessel information, container details, and pre-container information respectively.  The queries are designed to handle both updates and insertions to these tables.  Error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks and logging, with specific error messages returned to the client.

Recurring elements include the use of `agent_booking_id` as a primary key for identifying bookings across different tables and extensive use of parameterized queries for database interactions to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code uses `moment.js` for date and time manipulation.  The use of `fetchAgentBookingData` suggests a separation of concerns where data retrieval logic is separated from the controller logic.  The code also uses a custom `HttpError` class and a logger for error management and logging respectively.


## 1:27:34 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `menu.js` between 12:49 PM and 12:52 PM on July 17, 2025.  The file defines a menu structure for a frontend application, using `@mui/icons-material` for icons.  `iconsMap` maps keys to React components representing icons, while `menuItems` defines the menu structure, including labels, paths, and nested items.

The main changes track modifications to the `menuItems` array. Specifically:

* **12:49:03 PM:** Initial commit of the `menuItems` array, including sections for "Dashboard," "Admin Master," "SPR," "Code," "Detention1," "Components," and a single "CNG" item.

* **12:49:27 PM:** A minor change appears in the "Detention1" section;  "Line Wise" label is modified to "Line Wise@@"

* **12:49:59 PM:** "Detention1" is renamed to "Detention" and the "CNG" item is removed.

* **12:51:11 PM:** "Detention" is renamed to "Detention678" and its `iconKey` changed to "detention00".

* **12:52:32 PM:**  The final edit reverts the name back to "Detention" and the `iconKey` from "detention00" back to "detention".  The `menuItems` array is otherwise unchanged from 12:49:59 PM version.

The `iconsMap` object remains constant throughout all edits.  The changes primarily focus on refining the menu's labels and organization, specifically within the "Detention" section. There's no significant pattern besides the repeated adjustments to the "Detention" section's name and `iconKey`.


## 2:27:16 PM
The code changes primarily involve the development of a booking management screen (`CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx`).  Several files were updated on July 17, 2025, between approximately 2:17 PM and 2:23 PM.

`enums.js` (2:17:34 PM): This file defines various enums used throughout the application. These enums categorize user roles (`UserRoleEnum`), user statuses (`UserStatusEnum`), shipment statuses (`SHIPMENT_STATUS_OBJ`), booking statuses (`BookingStatusEnum`, `CngBookingStatusEnum`), and other application-specific data types.  The `SHIPMENT_STATUS_OBJ` enum is notable for its use of MUI icons to represent different shipment states.

`BookingFilters.jsx` (2:18:11 PM & 2:22:54 PM): This component was modified twice. The first version used `CngBookingStatusEnum` for booking status filters. The second version, updated at 2:22:54 PM, switched to `BookingStatusEnum`, significantly expanding the filter options to include 'Sailed', 'Arrived', 'Booked', 'Drafts', and 'Ingate' statuses. This suggests a refinement of the booking status management.  Both versions use React Redux for state management and provide filtering capabilities for Shipper, Consignee, POL, and POD.

`CngBookingFilters.jsx` (2:23:17 PM): This component remains largely consistent with the first version of `BookingFilters.jsx`, using `CngBookingStatusEnum` for its booking status filter options.  Its function is to provide filtering for CNG bookings, distinct from the broader booking types handled in `BookingFilters.jsx`.

`CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx` (2:23:24 PM): This file contains the main logic for the CNG booking screen. It uses React, Redux, and several custom components (e.g., `ThemedGrid`, `StatsCard`, `BookingFilters`, `CngBookingFilters`) to display and manage CNG bookings.  The component incorporates features such as pagination, sorting, searching, different views (grid and card), and agent assignment functionality. The use of `debounce` on the `handleAssignAgent` function suggests optimization for performance with large datasets.  The component fetches data via a custom query hook (`useFetchCngBookingDataQuery`) and includes data visualization with `StatsCard` displaying New, Approved, and Cancelled booking counts.  It also shows a significant amount of detailed logic for assigning agents to bookings via a modal.


The changes exhibit a pattern of iterative development and refinement of the booking management features, particularly regarding booking status filtering and the distinction between general and CNG-specific bookings.  The use of React, Redux, and MUI is consistent throughout.


## 3:26:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `cng_booking.controller.ts` file between 2:28 PM and 3:12 PM on July 17, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be refining the `getAll` function within the controller.

Initially, the `getAll` function lacked robust filtering capabilities.  Subsequent revisions progressively improved filtering by adding parameters for `shipper`, `consignee`, `pol`, and `pod` to the query parameters, and dynamically constructing the `WHERE` clause in `fetchAgentBookingData` to handle these filters.  The type parameter, initially used for filtering, was later integrated into the filters object.  The changes between 2:34 PM and 2:45 PM, for example, demonstrate this iterative addition and refinement of filter capabilities.  The handling of the `booking_status` filter also underwent modification, changing where and how it was applied.  Finally, around 3:00 PM the `booking_status` parameter was removed from the `getAll` function's parameters, showing a change in implementation approach for the booking status filtering.

The `updateBooking` function remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.  It consistently handles updates and insertions into `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, and `agent_booking_container` tables based on the provided data.  The function uses conditional logic to update or insert into related tables depending on whether data already exists.  The code also uses a `clean` function to handle empty string values.

The `bookingXMLGenerate` function also remained consistent, generating XML data based on an `agent_booking_id`.

The `fetchAgentBookingData` function is called by `getAll` and responsible for fetching data from the database.  Its `filters` parameter's structure was modified to support enhanced filtering capabilities added in the `getAll` function revisions.  The removal of `booking_status` from `fetchAgentBookingData`'s parameters around 3:00 PM corresponds with its removal from `getAll`'s parameters. The final change at 3:12 PM reintroduced `booking_status` into `fetchAgentBookingData` parameters.  This suggests a change in logic that had `booking_status` passed in directly, and later was modified again to pass it as a filter.

Throughout the log, there's a consistent pattern of using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The use of `async/await` is also consistent, indicating asynchronous database operations. The error handling is consistently implemented using try-catch blocks and logging.

The most significant changes occurred around 2:34 PM (introduction of additional filters) and around 3:00 PM (re-organizing filtering handling and parameter passing).  The final version at 3:12 PM represents a consolidated version of changes.  The 200 OK status code replaced 404 status code for empty result sets in the `getAll` function.


## 3:27:20 PM
The log shows multiple code modifications across several files within the `t360-frontend` directory of a React application, primarily focusing on a CNG booking screen.  The changes span from 2:35 PM to 3:18 PM on July 17, 2025.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\store\freatures\cngBookingSlice.js`**: This file, modified at 2:35 PM and later at 2:50 PM, defines Redux reducers for managing the state of the CNG booking dashboard.  The 2:50 PM update changes the initial state of `status` from an empty array to `["ALL"]`, implying a default selection of all booking statuses.  Other notable actions include filtering (`toggleBookingDashboardFilter`), updating input data (`updateBookingDashboardInput`), managing pagination and view (`setBookingDashboardPagination`, `setBookingDashboardView`), and handling sorting (`setBookingDashboardSortBy`, `setBookingDashboardSortModel`). List manipulation actions (`addList`, `updateList`, `removeList`) and managing selected agents (`setSeletedAgent`) are also present.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\CngBookingFilters.jsx`**:  This component, responsible for rendering booking filters, underwent several revisions between 2:38 PM and 3:18 PM. The initial version (2:38 PM) used `filterInfo?.counts` to display counts for each booking status. This was changed at 2:40 PM, to use `filterInfo?.data?.booking_status`. Subsequent edits at 2:43 PM removed count information from the booking status options and corrected a typo ("Calcelled" to "Cancelled"). The final change (3:18 PM) significantly alters how filter options are retrieved from the `filterInfo` prop. Instead of mapping options for Shipper, Consignee, POL and POD, it directly accesses them from `filterInfo?.data` without mapping, and even removes the mapping for shipper and pod to directly access the data. This suggests a change in the structure of data received from the backend.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\cng-booking\CngBookingScreenExtend.jsx`**: This file, modified several times between 2:43 PM and 3:18 PM, displays the CNG booking screen.  The major changes revolve around the API call parameters used in  `useFetchCngBookingDataQuery`. Initially (2:43 PM), it used separate parameters for `booking_status`, `pol`, `pod`, `shipper`, and `consignee`. The 2:49 PM revision added logging to better monitor API parameters, and changes `booking_status` to handle undefined value if `selector?.status` is ALL.  At 2:49 PM and then at 2:50 PM, the `booking_status` parameter is consistently refactored.  The most significant update at 2:55 PM changes the parameter `booking_status` to `type`, aligning with a potential backend API change.  The component also displays booking data in card or grid view, based on the Redux state, and includes functionality for assigning agents (using a modal).  Logging statements are added to help debug data flow (2:49 PM and 3:03 PM).

In summary, the code changes reflect a significant refactor of the CNG booking screen to accommodate changes in the backend API responses, specifically in how filter options and booking status data are structured and received. The developers used logging to track changes and ensure proper function. The modifications were largely focused on refining data fetching and display, along with consistent handling of filter data.
