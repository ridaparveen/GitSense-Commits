# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:27:42 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `dashboard-page.tsx` and `global.ts`.  The `global.ts` file, updated twice within a short timeframe (10:18:57 AM and 10:19:03 AM), contains definitions for various status and role options, including `SHIPMENT_STATUS`, `REPORTS_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_ROLE`, `BOOKING_STATUS`, `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_STATUS`, and `BOOKING_SORT_OPTIONS`. The changes between the two updates to `global.ts` appear to be negligible or nonexistent based on the provided code snippets.  These options define color codes associated with different statuses using a consistent naming pattern (`bg-{color}-500`).

The `dashboard-page.tsx` file (updated at 10:12:56 AM and 10:21:37 AM) is a React component for a dashboard page.  The updates involve modifications to the UI, specifically the date selection component, and the addition of a "New Booking" button.  The component fetches data using Redux and several API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`).  The code includes extensive logic for handling filters, pagination, sorting, and displaying data related to shipments and deliveries.  The second update to `dashboard-page.tsx` appears to contain only minor cosmetic changes in the code based on the provided snippets and not significant functional changes.  The component utilizes various React libraries and icons for its presentation.
