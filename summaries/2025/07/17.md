# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:27:42 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `dashboard-page.tsx` and `global.ts`.  The `global.ts` file, updated twice within a short timeframe (10:18:57 AM and 10:19:03 AM), contains definitions for various status and role options, including `SHIPMENT_STATUS`, `REPORTS_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_ROLE`, `BOOKING_STATUS`, `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_STATUS`, and `BOOKING_SORT_OPTIONS`. The changes between the two updates to `global.ts` appear to be negligible or nonexistent based on the provided code snippets.  These options define color codes associated with different statuses using a consistent naming pattern (`bg-{color}-500`).

The `dashboard-page.tsx` file (updated at 10:12:56 AM and 10:21:37 AM) is a React component for a dashboard page.  The updates involve modifications to the UI, specifically the date selection component, and the addition of a "New Booking" button.  The component fetches data using Redux and several API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchDeliveryDataQuery`, `useFetchCartDataQuery`).  The code includes extensive logic for handling filters, pagination, sorting, and displaying data related to shipments and deliveries.  The second update to `dashboard-page.tsx` appears to contain only minor cosmetic changes in the code based on the provided snippets and not significant functional changes.  The component utilizes various React libraries and icons for its presentation.

The codebase primarily deals with managing and updating booking information, likely for a transportation or logistics system.  The `cng_booking.controller.ts` file contains controllers for retrieving, updating, and generating XML data related to bookings.

Significant updates on **July 17, 2025, at 1:24:45 PM** include the addition and modification of several functions within this controller.  The `getAll` function retrieves booking data based on various filter criteria, including pagination and sorting.  The `updateBooking` function updates booking information in the `agent_booking_entry` table and related tables (`agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_container_pre`). This function handles updates to both existing and new entries in these tables.  The `bookingXMLGenerate` function generates an XML representation of a booking which is then presumably sent to another service.

The code extensively uses SQL queries to interact with a PostgreSQL database.  Several database tables are involved, including `agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_vessel`, `agent_booking_container`, and `agent_booking_container_pre`, suggesting a relational database schema designed to store booking details, vessel information, container details, and pre-container information respectively.  The queries are designed to handle both updates and insertions to these tables.  Error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks and logging, with specific error messages returned to the client.

Recurring elements include the use of `agent_booking_id` as a primary key for identifying bookings across different tables and extensive use of parameterized queries for database interactions to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code uses `moment.js` for date and time manipulation.  The use of `fetchAgentBookingData` suggests a separation of concerns where data retrieval logic is separated from the controller logic.  The code also uses a custom `HttpError` class and a logger for error management and logging respectively.
