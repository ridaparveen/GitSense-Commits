# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 9:40:10 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `envosys-frontend` React application, primarily focused on the House Bill of Lading (HBL) list and HBL form components.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\mbl\action.tsx`**: This file, updated at 5:20:34 PM on July 30, 2025, defines functions `getBookingActions` and `getMblActions` which return arrays of menu action items.  `getBookingActions` is fully implemented, while `getMblActions` appears to be a commented-out duplicate or an early version.  Both functions use navigation and modal functions as parameters and return actions based on access control (`AccessType`).

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\mbl\HblListOfMbl.tsx`**: This component, representing the HBL list, underwent multiple revisions between 5:21:26 PM and 5:31:11 PM on July 30, 2025.  Key changes include:

*   **5:21:26 PM:** Initial commit showing a basic HBL list using `AppDataGrid` and a custom menu (`TMenu`) for actions.  Uses dummy data (`DUMMY_AGENT_ROWS`).
*   **5:23:28 PM:** Pagination is added to the `AppDataGrid` component using `paginationModel` and `onPageChange`. The total count of items is set to 50.
*   **5:24:32 PM and 5:24:46 PM:** `AppDataGrid` is replaced with `ClientGrid`,  enabling row selection.
*   **5:25:21 PM:**  Removal of unnecessary imports, simplifying the component.
*   **5:29:26 PM:** Addition of `headerAlign: "left"` to the columns in `columnsWithActions` and a change in the "New HBL" button to include a navigation link.
*   **5:31:11 PM:** The "New HBL" button now uses `onClick` and navigates to "/app/import/mbl/addNewMblForm/newHbl".

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\enquiry-coulms.tsx`**: This file, updated multiple times between 5:25:43 PM and 5:30:00 PM on July 30, 2025, defines column configurations for data grids.  Specifically, `ADD_HBL_LIST_COLUMNS` is repeatedly modified, adjusting header alignment (`headerAlign`) and column widths for better presentation. The final version sets all header alignments to "left".


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\mbl\AddNewHblForm.tsx`**: This file, representing the HBL form, saw significant changes between 6:05:27 PM and 6:36:48 PM on July 30, 2025. The most significant changes are:

*   **6:05:27 PM:** Initial commit, showing a form with numerous input fields using a mix of `@mui/material` and custom components.  Uses tabs (`ThemeTabs`) to organize sections.  Modal functionality is implemented using `ThemedModal` for adding and viewing HBL parties.
*   **6:07:33 PM and 6:08:02 PM:** The component is wrapped with `PageWrapper` for better layout.  A page title is added.
*   **6:09:30 PM and 6:09:53 PM:**  The layout of the form is changed to a `grid` system using tailwind classes for better responsiveness and visual appeal.
*   **6:22:43 PM - 6:36:48 PM:**  The form is converted to use `formik` for form management.  `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components from `@components/common/tailwind_common` are introduced. The `@mui/material` components are gradually replaced with tailwind components.  The HBL Party section is also refined.  Finally, the implementation of the modals is removed, keeping only the buttons to open the modals.
*   **6:51:22 PM:** Added a back button to navigate to the MBL add new form using `FaArrowLeft` icon and updated page title to `New HBL`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\mbl\MblDeatilsPage.tsx`**: This page, updated at 6:55:41 PM on July 30, 2025, is a container for the `MblDetailsForm`. It includes navigation using `useNavigate` and displays customer and sales information. It shows the use of custom `PageWrapper` component.

In summary, the code changes reflect a significant refactoring effort to improve the user interface and implement form management using `formik`.  The changes moved from using `@mui` components to using tailwind and custom components.  The consistent use of custom components (`CustomPaper`, `TMenu`, `AppDataGrid`, `ClientGrid`, `SelectBox`, `InputBox`, `PageWrapper`, `ThemeTabs`) suggests a deliberate effort toward code reusability and a consistent design system.  The multiple revisions to `HblListOfMbl.tsx` and `enquiry-coulms.tsx` show iterative improvements in the data presentation.  The final version of `AddNewHblForm.tsx` is almost completely using Tailwind CSS.
