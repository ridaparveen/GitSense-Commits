# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 9:40:10 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `envosys-frontend` React application, primarily focused on the House Bill of Lading (HBL) list and HBL form components.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\mbl\action.tsx`**: This file, updated at 5:20:34 PM on July 30, 2025, defines functions `getBookingActions` and `getMblActions` which return arrays of menu action items.  `getBookingActions` is fully implemented, while `getMblActions` appears to be a commented-out duplicate or an early version.  Both functions use navigation and modal functions as parameters and return actions based on access control (`AccessType`).

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\mbl\HblListOfMbl.tsx`**: This component, representing the HBL list, underwent multiple revisions between 5:21:26 PM and 5:31:11 PM on July 30, 2025.  Key changes include:

*   **5:21:26 PM:** Initial commit showing a basic HBL list using `AppDataGrid` and a custom menu (`TMenu`) for actions.  Uses dummy data (`DUMMY_AGENT_ROWS`).
*   **5:23:28 PM:** Pagination is added to the `AppDataGrid` component using `paginationModel` and `onPageChange`. The total count of items is set to 50.
*   **5:24:32 PM and 5:24:46 PM:** `AppDataGrid` is replaced with `ClientGrid`,  enabling row selection.
*   **5:25:21 PM:**  Removal of unnecessary imports, simplifying the component.
*   **5:29:26 PM:** Addition of `headerAlign: "left"` to the columns in `columnsWithActions` and a change in the "New HBL" button to include a navigation link.
*   **5:31:11 PM:** The "New HBL" button now uses `onClick` and navigates to "/app/import/mbl/addNewMblForm/newHbl".

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\enquiry-coulms.tsx`**: This file, updated multiple times between 5:25:43 PM and 5:30:00 PM on July 30, 2025, defines column configurations for data grids.  Specifically, `ADD_HBL_LIST_COLUMNS` is repeatedly modified, adjusting header alignment (`headerAlign`) and column widths for better presentation. The final version sets all header alignments to "left".


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\mbl\AddNewHblForm.tsx`**: This file, representing the HBL form, saw significant changes between 6:05:27 PM and 6:36:48 PM on July 30, 2025. The most significant changes are:

*   **6:05:27 PM:** Initial commit, showing a form with numerous input fields using a mix of `@mui/material` and custom components.  Uses tabs (`ThemeTabs`) to organize sections.  Modal functionality is implemented using `ThemedModal` for adding and viewing HBL parties.
*   **6:07:33 PM and 6:08:02 PM:** The component is wrapped with `PageWrapper` for better layout.  A page title is added.
*   **6:09:30 PM and 6:09:53 PM:**  The layout of the form is changed to a `grid` system using tailwind classes for better responsiveness and visual appeal.
*   **6:22:43 PM - 6:36:48 PM:**  The form is converted to use `formik` for form management.  `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components from `@components/common/tailwind_common` are introduced. The `@mui/material` components are gradually replaced with tailwind components.  The HBL Party section is also refined.  Finally, the implementation of the modals is removed, keeping only the buttons to open the modals.
*   **6:51:22 PM:** Added a back button to navigate to the MBL add new form using `FaArrowLeft` icon and updated page title to `New HBL`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\mbl\MblDeatilsPage.tsx`**: This page, updated at 6:55:41 PM on July 30, 2025, is a container for the `MblDetailsForm`. It includes navigation using `useNavigate` and displays customer and sales information. It shows the use of custom `PageWrapper` component.

In summary, the code changes reflect a significant refactoring effort to improve the user interface and implement form management using `formik`.  The changes moved from using `@mui` components to using tailwind and custom components.  The consistent use of custom components (`CustomPaper`, `TMenu`, `AppDataGrid`, `ClientGrid`, `SelectBox`, `InputBox`, `PageWrapper`, `ThemeTabs`) suggests a deliberate effort toward code reusability and a consistent design system.  The multiple revisions to `HblListOfMbl.tsx` and `enquiry-coulms.tsx` show iterative improvements in the data presentation.  The final version of `AddNewHblForm.tsx` is almost completely using Tailwind CSS.


## 11:42:29 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ShipperForm.tsx` and `ConsigneeForm.tsx`, and `Notify1Form.tsx`  components between 11:22 AM and 11:41 AM on July 31, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the UI layout and structure of forms using Tailwind CSS's `grid` system.

Initially, `ShipperForm.tsx` used `Stack` components for layout. This was replaced with `div` elements utilizing `grid-cols-3` and later `grid-cols-4` for a three and four column grid layout respectively, improving the form's visual arrangement.  There's also a significant refactoring of the checkbox component for "Print On BL," moving it outside the main `grid` layout and improving its styling.  The `name` attributes of input fields are added in later versions which were missing earlier.  Several versions included commented-out code, eventually removed.  Around 11:31 AM, the component received significant updates, adding more specific names to input fields (`shipper_name`, `address_line1`, etc.) and improving the spacing between elements (`gap-x-6 gap-y-4`).  The final version settled on a `grid-cols-3` layout.

`ConsigneeForm.tsx`, created around 11:38 AM, mirrors the structure of the final `ShipperForm.tsx` version, using a `grid-cols-4` layout and including several `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components with placeholder values.  It also includes  a "Print On BL" checkbox and employs hidden input fields using `type="hidden"` similar to the changes made to `ShipperForm.tsx`.

`Notify1Form.tsx`, created around 11:41 AM, also uses a `grid-cols-4` layout, is very similar to `ConsigneeForm.tsx` and  features a checkbox for "Print On BL" and another for "Same as Consignee".


The recurring pattern across all three components is the use of `AutocompleteBox`, `InputBox`, `SelectBox`,  a checkbox with associated label,  and hidden input fields.  The changes reflect a consistent effort to refine the UI layout and add functionality, specifically the addition of names to fields. The use of placeholder values (`value={"kkk"}`, `options={[]}`) suggests that data binding and data population are to be implemented later.


## 2:20:25 PM
The log shows modifications to several React component files within an Envosys frontend application.  The changes span from 11:42 AM to 12:21 PM on July 31, 2025.

`Notify1Form.tsx` underwent several minor revisions between 11:42 AM and 11:43 AM.  These modifications primarily involved adjusting the CSS class `gap-6` within a `div` element containing form elements and changing the label of one checkbox from "Print On BL (Email & Contact)" to "Same as Consignee". The core functionality remained unchanged, as indicated by the consistent use of placeholder `console.log` statements within the input handlers.

`Notify2Form.tsx` was updated once at 11:44 AM with a similar structure to `Notify1Form.tsx`. This suggests these components were likely created or modified in tandem. They share a consistent styling and functional structure.

`ContainerDetails.tsx` underwent a significant refactor at 11:51 AM.  The component transitioned from a manually managed row-based structure using MUI components (`Box`, `IconButton`, `Stack`) to utilize a `DynamicEditableTable` component for handling container details. This component is imported from `@components/common/tailwind_common/DynamicEditableTable`, indicating a shift towards a more dynamic and reusable table structure. Minor code cleanup happened between 11:44 AM and 11:52 AM with the  removal of unused imports and the improvement of code clarity.

`RoutingList.tsx` was updated at 11:56 AM, 11:57 AM and 11:57 AM. The changes focus on adjusting column widths in the `DynamicEditableTable` component, suggesting improvements to layout and presentation.  Like `ContainerDetails.tsx`, this component also leverages the `DynamicEditableTable` for managing routing information.

`AddNewHblForm.tsx` experienced the most extensive modifications between 11:59 AM and 12:21 PM.  The component, which seems to be a form for adding new House Bills of Lading (HBL), was gradually enhanced. Initial changes involved incorporating Formik for form management and replacing some MUI components (`AppButton`) with tailwind components (`Button` from `@components/kit/button`).  A significant change involved the refactoring of the modal handling from using `ThemedModal`  to using `BaseModal` (from `@components/common/tailwind_common/modal`)  for both adding and viewing HBL parties.  The change also improved the layout and the modal size for better user experience and accessibility. There were several changes in the CSS class and structural changes done.


`ViewHblPartyList.tsx`  was altered multiple times between 2:05 PM and 2:14 PM.  The component was reworked to use a `ClientGrid` (from `@components/common/grid/ClientGrid`) for displaying the HBL party list.  Further modifications involved adding search and filter functionalities, enhancing the user interface with a search bar and a filter button, using Tailwind CSS classes for styling, and making the search bar more accessible.  The changes involved integrating `InputGroup` from `@components/kit/input`,  `MagnifyingGlassIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid`,  and finally changing the `TMenu` component to `@components/common/tailwind_common/TMenu`.


A recurring pattern across multiple components is the use of custom components from `@components/common` and `@components/kit`, promoting code reusability and consistency.  The incorporation of Formik and the shift towards a `DynamicEditableTable` suggest a strategy of improving the overall user experience and maintainability of the application. The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes also suggests a shift to using Tailwind CSS for styling.


## 3:20:22 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `ViewHblPartyList.tsx` component and the `hbl-coulmns.tsx` file within an Envosys frontend project.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the data display and export functionality of the `ViewHblPartyList` component.

**`ViewHblPartyList.tsx` Updates:**

* **7/31/2025, 2:29:07 PM:** Initial commit of the `ViewHblPartyList` component.  The component renders a data grid using `ClientGrid`,  displays a search bar, and includes functionality for pagination and sorting. Dummy data (`DUMMY_AGENT_ROWS`) is used.

* **7/31/2025, 2:31:08 PM:** Added an "Export Data" button that utilizes the `generateExcel` function to export the grid data to an Excel file. A loading indicator (`Loader`) is introduced to manage the export process.

* **7/31/2025, 2:31:18 PM:**  The `ArrowDownTrayIcon` component is imported to improve the visual representation of the "Export Data" button.

* **7/31/2025, 2:32:54 PM:** The `MoreVertIcon` in the action menu is replaced with `EllipsisVerticalIcon`.

* **7/31/2025, 2:36:36 PM:** The component's data grid columns are now dynamically generated using the `HBL_PARTY_LIST_COULMNS` function imported from `hbl-coulmns.tsx`.

* **7/31/2025, 2:37:06 PM and 2:37:15 PM:** Minor adjustments to the `pageSizeOptions` in the `ClientGrid` component.

* **7/31/2025, 2:41:09 PM:** The structure of `DUMMY_AGENT_ROWS` is modified, adding more fields and changing the data type of existing fields.

* **7/31/2025, 2:43:34 PM:**  The `DUMMY_AGENT_ROWS` data is significantly altered, replacing the initial dummy data with a more structured set of objects representing HBL party information (including fields like `code`, `ies`, `city`, etc.).  The number of dummy rows has been increased to 10.


* **7/31/2025, 2:44:25 PM:** The data in `DUMMY_AGENT_ROWS`  is further refined and contains consistent data across all objects.  Ids are correctly assigned.


* **7/31/2025, 2:48:30 PM:** The `handleExcel` function is updated to pass the `headers` from `HBL_PARTY_LIST_COULMNS` directly to the `generateExcel` function, rather than using `columnsWithActions`.  This simplifies the code and likely improves data integrity in the export.

* **7/31/2025, 2:49:22 PM:** The `ADD_HBL_LIST_COLUMNS` import is removed, indicating the component no longer uses it.  The component's column data now solely depends on `HBL_PARTY_LIST_COULMNS`.


**`hbl-coulmns.tsx` Updates:**


* **7/31/2025, 2:35:44 PM:**  The initial creation of `HBL_PARTY_LIST_COULMNS`, defining the columns for the HBL party list data grid.  The initial version shows columns related to MBL status, number, line, vessel, voyage, POL, POD, ETD, ETA and number of added HBLs.  Status is displayed as a Badge component.

* **7/31/2025, 2:37:48 PM:** Modified the status rendering in the `HBL_PARTY_LIST_COULMNS` to simply display the raw status with a lime colored badge.

* **7/31/2025, 2:39:37 PM and 2:39:49 PM:**  The columns defined in `HBL_PARTY_LIST_COULMNS` are entirely revised. The new columns represent HBL party details (code, IES party code, city, party, country, state, and party type).  The data type of all these fields is specified as "number" which might need adjustment.

The overall pattern shows a progressive refinement of the `ViewHblPartyList` component, starting with a basic data grid and culminating in a component with robust data export capabilities and a refined data structure. The data structure is improved to match the new columns specified in `hbl-coulmns.tsx` from less descriptive fields to detailed party information.  The `hbl-coulmns.tsx` file shows a significant shift in the type of data displayed in the component. The `ADD_HBL_LIST_COLUMNS` data from `enquiry-coulmns.tsx` is removed completely.
