# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 10:07:37 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to invoice generation and customer details within a React application.  The `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` component underwent the most significant changes between 9:10:09 AM and 9:32:22 AM.  These changes involved refactoring the component to utilize a `useState` hook to manage invoice data, transitioning from directly rendering invoice details to dynamically populating them from the `invoiceData` state object. This improved code maintainability and readability. The changes also involved a consistent update to the styling and structure to ensure better presentation in PDF format.  The changes made to `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` at  9:24:10 AM and 9:24:41 AM show a shift towards using `invoiceData` object properties directly for populating the invoice fields.

The `InvoiceTable.tsx` component was modified between 9:33:39 AM and 9:36:05 AM, primarily simplifying the styling and structure of the component and removing some redundant code.  The most notable change is that unnecessary styling components were removed, leading to the simplification and cleaning of the component. Before the changes, the component contained hardcoded data; after the changes, the component renders data passed as props. This change makes the component reusable across different parts of the application.

Finally, `GstRejistrtaionDetails.tsx` and `AddGstRejistrationPopupForm.tsx` were updated with new components and functionality to manage GST registration details.  These changes show the addition of  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for GST registration details, and  utilize Redux for managing the state of the GST registration list.  The `AlertMapping.tsx` component shows a series of small changes focused on simplifying the layout and removing unnecessary code,  but the core functionality remains the same.  The most significant change in this component happened between 9:55:01 AM and 10:03:49 AM which involved the removal of action buttons from the table.


## 11:07:31 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `AlertMapping.tsx` component between 10:08 AM and 11:02 AM on July 28, 2025.  The primary changes involve refactoring the component to use Redux for managing alert data. Initially, the component managed alert data internally using the `useState` hook.  The `DeleteIcon` was replaced with a custom `CustomDeleteIcon` from `../../../assets/SvgIcon` around 10:09 AM.

Between 10:11 AM and 10:15 AM, the `AlertMapping` component was integrated into the `CustomerNavTab` component and a `formik` prop was added to allow interaction with a form library.  The code formatting was also improved during these changes.

The most substantial changes occurred between 10:54 AM and 11:02 AM.  The component was significantly reworked to interact with Redux actions (`addList`, `removeList`, `updateList`) for managing the `alertMappingList` in the Redux store. The component now uses `setFieldValue` from `formik` to update the form state and uses `slno` as a unique identifier for rows, which is maintained and updated on every change.  The data structure of the `alerts` array was also modified, with several field names renamed (e.g., `alertName` to `alerts`, `alertType` to `alerts_type`, etc.).  The `handleAddRow` function now logs the groupName to the console.  A key difference in the final version is the use of `setFieldValue("alertMappingDetails", updatedAlerts)` instead of `setFieldValue("alertMappingList", updatedAlerts)`, consistently using `alertMappingDetails` to reflect the changes.

The `boxPlanCoulmns.tsx` file was updated at 10:21 AM to create a configurable column structure for a table, likely related to Box Plan details, using Material UI's `Table` component, allowing for read-only input boxes within cells and selection of rows via radio buttons.

The `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` component, updated at 10:56 AM, shows the `alertMappingDetails`  as part of its initial state, reflecting the changes in the data structure of `AlertMapping.tsx`. The `Fac.tsx` component, updated at 10:19 AM, manages a dynamic table of "Fac Details" using formik for updating fields and allowing adding and deleting rows.  The `GstRejistrtaionDetails.tsx` component, updated around 10:20 AM, displays and manages GST registration details using `ClientGridPro` for table rendering and Redux for data management.  This component includes add, edit, and delete functionalities.  The `App.tsx` file shows routing configuration for different pages of the application.  There is no modification for this file after 10:16 AM.  The `CustomerNavTab.tsx` component shows a consistent structure with `formik` prop passed throughout.


## 12:07:31 PM
The log shows several React component updates within the `envosys-frontend` project on July 28, 2025.  The changes primarily involve form components and data grids.

**`FacDetails.tsx` (11:21:44 AM):** This component displays and manages a table of "facList" data.  It allows adding, deleting, and updating rows. Each row includes input fields (InputBoxExtend, SelectBoxExtend) for rebate party, currency, unit type, unit rate, and total amount.  A separate section handles "brokage party" and "brokage percentage."  The component uses `formik` for form handling and `react-redux` for state management.

**`CustomerNavTab.tsx` (11:22:08 AM):** A tab component rendering various customer detail sub-components (`KeyPersonalTab`, `AlertTable`, `CreditControl`, `FacDetails`, `GstRejistrtaionDetails`, `UploadFiles`). It uses a `ThemeTabs` component for the tab rendering and passes the `formik` object to child components.

**`GstRegistrationTab.tsx` (11:27:36 AM):** This component renders a data grid (`ClientGridPro`) for GST registration details, fetching data from Redux store (`vendorDetailsForm.gstRejistrationList`).  It includes functionality for adding and deleting rows and uses a modal (`EditGSTRegistration`) for editing. Redux actions `removeList` and `addList` are used.  The grid shows actions for editing and deleting rows.


**`AddNewHblForm.tsx` (11:35:43 AM and 11:37:53 AM):** Two very similar versions of this component exist, differing only slightly in the import path for `HBL_DETAILS_TABDATA`.  This component is a form for adding new HBL (House Bill of Lading) details.  It uses several UI elements, including date/time pickers, dropdowns, and input boxes.  It also incorporates modal dialogs for adding and viewing HBL party information.  The structure indicates a multi-step form using tabs (`ThemeTabs`).  The minor change between the two timestamps suggests a simple path correction.


**`VendorDetailsForm.tsx` (11:41:12 AM):**  This is a form for vendor details, using `formik` for form management. It includes input fields for vendor information, a status selector, and tabs for GST registration, tariff details, and file uploads.  The tabs each contain a dedicated component.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` (11:42:03 AM):** This component manages vessel voyage details.  It features input fields for vessel name, voyage number, POL (Port of Loading), and date pickers for various ETAs, ETDs, and cut-off dates.  It includes a dynamically updating list of routing details (`routingList`) managed via Redux (`addList`, `removeList`, `updateList`). The component utilizes AutoComplete for POD (Port of Discharge) selection and uses `formik` for form handling.

**`EnquiryPage.tsx` (12:06:21 PM and 12:06:29 PM):**  This page component renders an enquiry dashboard. A simple typo correction ("Enquiry Dashboard1" to "Enquiry Dashboard") is made within a very short time window.


Overall, the changes reflect the development of several interconnected form components for managing different types of data within the Envosys application. The use of `formik` and `react-redux` is consistent throughout, indicating a unified approach to state management and form handling. The frequent use of modals suggests a focus on user experience and improved interaction.
