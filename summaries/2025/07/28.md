# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 10:07:37 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to invoice generation and customer details within a React application.  The `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` component underwent the most significant changes between 9:10:09 AM and 9:32:22 AM.  These changes involved refactoring the component to utilize a `useState` hook to manage invoice data, transitioning from directly rendering invoice details to dynamically populating them from the `invoiceData` state object. This improved code maintainability and readability. The changes also involved a consistent update to the styling and structure to ensure better presentation in PDF format.  The changes made to `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` at  9:24:10 AM and 9:24:41 AM show a shift towards using `invoiceData` object properties directly for populating the invoice fields.

The `InvoiceTable.tsx` component was modified between 9:33:39 AM and 9:36:05 AM, primarily simplifying the styling and structure of the component and removing some redundant code.  The most notable change is that unnecessary styling components were removed, leading to the simplification and cleaning of the component. Before the changes, the component contained hardcoded data; after the changes, the component renders data passed as props. This change makes the component reusable across different parts of the application.

Finally, `GstRejistrtaionDetails.tsx` and `AddGstRejistrationPopupForm.tsx` were updated with new components and functionality to manage GST registration details.  These changes show the addition of  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for GST registration details, and  utilize Redux for managing the state of the GST registration list.  The `AlertMapping.tsx` component shows a series of small changes focused on simplifying the layout and removing unnecessary code,  but the core functionality remains the same.  The most significant change in this component happened between 9:55:01 AM and 10:03:49 AM which involved the removal of action buttons from the table.


## 11:07:31 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `AlertMapping.tsx` component between 10:08 AM and 11:02 AM on July 28, 2025.  The primary changes involve refactoring the component to use Redux for managing alert data. Initially, the component managed alert data internally using the `useState` hook.  The `DeleteIcon` was replaced with a custom `CustomDeleteIcon` from `../../../assets/SvgIcon` around 10:09 AM.

Between 10:11 AM and 10:15 AM, the `AlertMapping` component was integrated into the `CustomerNavTab` component and a `formik` prop was added to allow interaction with a form library.  The code formatting was also improved during these changes.

The most substantial changes occurred between 10:54 AM and 11:02 AM.  The component was significantly reworked to interact with Redux actions (`addList`, `removeList`, `updateList`) for managing the `alertMappingList` in the Redux store. The component now uses `setFieldValue` from `formik` to update the form state and uses `slno` as a unique identifier for rows, which is maintained and updated on every change.  The data structure of the `alerts` array was also modified, with several field names renamed (e.g., `alertName` to `alerts`, `alertType` to `alerts_type`, etc.).  The `handleAddRow` function now logs the groupName to the console.  A key difference in the final version is the use of `setFieldValue("alertMappingDetails", updatedAlerts)` instead of `setFieldValue("alertMappingList", updatedAlerts)`, consistently using `alertMappingDetails` to reflect the changes.

The `boxPlanCoulmns.tsx` file was updated at 10:21 AM to create a configurable column structure for a table, likely related to Box Plan details, using Material UI's `Table` component, allowing for read-only input boxes within cells and selection of rows via radio buttons.

The `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` component, updated at 10:56 AM, shows the `alertMappingDetails`  as part of its initial state, reflecting the changes in the data structure of `AlertMapping.tsx`. The `Fac.tsx` component, updated at 10:19 AM, manages a dynamic table of "Fac Details" using formik for updating fields and allowing adding and deleting rows.  The `GstRejistrtaionDetails.tsx` component, updated around 10:20 AM, displays and manages GST registration details using `ClientGridPro` for table rendering and Redux for data management.  This component includes add, edit, and delete functionalities.  The `App.tsx` file shows routing configuration for different pages of the application.  There is no modification for this file after 10:16 AM.  The `CustomerNavTab.tsx` component shows a consistent structure with `formik` prop passed throughout.


## 12:07:31 PM
The log shows several React component updates within the `envosys-frontend` project on July 28, 2025.  The changes primarily involve form components and data grids.

**`FacDetails.tsx` (11:21:44 AM):** This component displays and manages a table of "facList" data.  It allows adding, deleting, and updating rows. Each row includes input fields (InputBoxExtend, SelectBoxExtend) for rebate party, currency, unit type, unit rate, and total amount.  A separate section handles "brokage party" and "brokage percentage."  The component uses `formik` for form handling and `react-redux` for state management.

**`CustomerNavTab.tsx` (11:22:08 AM):** A tab component rendering various customer detail sub-components (`KeyPersonalTab`, `AlertTable`, `CreditControl`, `FacDetails`, `GstRejistrtaionDetails`, `UploadFiles`). It uses a `ThemeTabs` component for the tab rendering and passes the `formik` object to child components.

**`GstRegistrationTab.tsx` (11:27:36 AM):** This component renders a data grid (`ClientGridPro`) for GST registration details, fetching data from Redux store (`vendorDetailsForm.gstRejistrationList`).  It includes functionality for adding and deleting rows and uses a modal (`EditGSTRegistration`) for editing. Redux actions `removeList` and `addList` are used.  The grid shows actions for editing and deleting rows.


**`AddNewHblForm.tsx` (11:35:43 AM and 11:37:53 AM):** Two very similar versions of this component exist, differing only slightly in the import path for `HBL_DETAILS_TABDATA`.  This component is a form for adding new HBL (House Bill of Lading) details.  It uses several UI elements, including date/time pickers, dropdowns, and input boxes.  It also incorporates modal dialogs for adding and viewing HBL party information.  The structure indicates a multi-step form using tabs (`ThemeTabs`).  The minor change between the two timestamps suggests a simple path correction.


**`VendorDetailsForm.tsx` (11:41:12 AM):**  This is a form for vendor details, using `formik` for form management. It includes input fields for vendor information, a status selector, and tabs for GST registration, tariff details, and file uploads.  The tabs each contain a dedicated component.

**`VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx` (11:42:03 AM):** This component manages vessel voyage details.  It features input fields for vessel name, voyage number, POL (Port of Loading), and date pickers for various ETAs, ETDs, and cut-off dates.  It includes a dynamically updating list of routing details (`routingList`) managed via Redux (`addList`, `removeList`, `updateList`). The component utilizes AutoComplete for POD (Port of Discharge) selection and uses `formik` for form handling.

**`EnquiryPage.tsx` (12:06:21 PM and 12:06:29 PM):**  This page component renders an enquiry dashboard. A simple typo correction ("Enquiry Dashboard1" to "Enquiry Dashboard") is made within a very short time window.


Overall, the changes reflect the development of several interconnected form components for managing different types of data within the Envosys application. The use of `formik` and `react-redux` is consistent throughout, indicating a unified approach to state management and form handling. The frequent use of modals suggests a focus on user experience and improved interaction.


## 1:10:09 PM
The `VendorDetailsForm.tsx` component was updated on July 28, 2025, at 12:11:42 PM.  This React component renders a form for vendor details, utilizing Material UI components like `Card`, `Box`, `Button`, `Typography`, and custom components like `SelectBox`, `CustomPaper`, and `InputBox`.  The form includes fields for vendor name, address, country, city, zipcode, phone numbers, fax, and email.  It also features a tabbed interface using `ThemeTabs` for "GST Registration Details," "Tariff Details," and "Upload Files," each handled by separate tab components. Formik is used for form handling and validation. The submission logs the form values to the console.  The component includes error handling via `formik.errors`.  The styling uses `sx` prop for Material UI components.  There is a `SelectBox` for vendor status using `statusOptions` data.  Input components are consistently structured using `InputBox` and `InputDropdown` for various fields.


## 3:19:42 PM
The log shows code changes across two files: `OverviewContainer.tsx` and `BookingDashboard.tsx`, primarily focusing on UI updates and data handling within a React application.  The changes span approximately 25 minutes (from 2:32 PM to 3:07 PM).


**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (Booking Overview):**

Several minor updates occurred between 2:32 PM and 2:34 PM.  The most significant change was in the button text and routing within the component.  The button changed from "+ New Enquiry" to "+ New Booking" and the navigation route updated to reflect this change in functionality: `/app/import/enquiry/addNewEnquiry`  to `/app/import/booking/addNewBooking`. The code was also slightly refactored for improved readability.


**`BookingDashboard.tsx` (Booking Dashboard):**

This file underwent more extensive modifications between 2:35 PM and 3:11 PM. The major updates focused on enhancing the data grid's visual presentation and functionality:

* **Status Display:** The rendering of the "Status" column was significantly improved, using the `BOOKING_STATUS` mapping from `common.ts` to display colored badges indicating the booking status (`Approved`, `New`, `Pending`, `Cancelled`).
* **Column Structure:** The columns displayed in the data grid were modified multiple times. Initially, the `FPD` and `Action` columns were removed, then added back, and finally rearranged.  The column widths were also adjusted throughout these changes, ultimately settling on narrower widths for several columns (150px).
* **Export Button Icon:** The icon for the "Export Data" button changed from `FileCopyOutlined` to `FaDownload` and then to `ArrowDownTrayIcon`, suggesting ongoing experimentation with the UI's visual design.
* **Import of `booking-coulmns.tsx`:**  The `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COULMNS` were moved into their own dedicated file, `booking-coulmns.tsx`.  This shows a step towards better code organization.


**`data\options\common.ts` (Common Options):**

The `BOOKING_STATUS` object was updated to use the color `'lime'` instead of `'green'` for 'Approved' status at 3:04 PM.  This suggests a minor styling adjustment.


**`data\coulmns\booking-coulmns.tsx` (Booking Columns):**

This file was created at 2:49 PM and underwent multiple revisions to define the columns for the booking dashboard grid. The key change is the introduction of the styled status badge (using a color-coded Badge component) to represent the status in a more user-friendly way.  The column widths were also adjusted repeatedly, resulting in narrower columns.


**`data\dummy-data.ts` (Dummy Data):**

This file underwent several edits between 3:00 PM and 3:02 PM. The most noteworthy change was the modification of booking statuses in the `bookingData` array.  Initially some status labels had typos ("Cancel" changed to "Canceled", "Canceld" changed to "Cancelled").  The status values were also updated to reflect a more comprehensive set of booking statuses (e.g., 'New', 'Cancelled', 'Pending'). This indicates a refinement of the data model to match the improved display in the `BookingDashboard`.

In summary, the changes reflect iterative development, focusing on enhancing the UI and data presentation of the booking dashboard. There's a clear pattern of refining the display of booking status, using visual cues for better user experience.  The process of organizing the column definitions into a separate file also showcases the improvement of code structure.


## 3:42:36 PM
The code represents a React component (`BookingDashboard`) displaying a booking dashboard.  On July 28, 2025, at 3:20:12 PM, the component was updated.  The update involved significant changes to the user interface, encompassing various UI elements like cards, input boxes, and a data grid (`AppGrid`) to display booking data fetched using `useFetchBookingDashboardDataQuery`.

The component fetches and displays booking data categorized by status (new, pending, completed, cancelled), allowing for search, filtering, sorting, and pagination. Filtering is achieved via a sidebar (`FilterSidebar`), offering options for date range, booking type, status, place of loading (POL), place of delivery (POD), and shipper.  Sorting is handled by a dropdown (`SortDropdown`). The data grid displays the booking list, enabling navigation to edit individual bookings.

The component uses Redux for state management (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), with reducers for setting filters, pagination, and sort order.  It leverages several custom components for UI elements and icons from `@heroicons/react` and `react-icons`.  Error handling or loading states (`isLoading`, `isFetching`) are also implemented.  The component dynamically renders filter options based on data received from the API.


## 7:09:31 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `BookingDetails` component and its encompassing page (`BookingDetailsPage`) within a React application.  The primary focus of the changes is a UI transformation from Material UI components to a Tailwind CSS-based structure.  This involved replacing components like `Box`, `Card`, `CardContent`, `Stack`, and `Typography` (Material UI) with Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout.  Specifically, the `BookingDetails` component was significantly restructured to use `div` elements with Tailwind CSS classes like `flex`, `flex-col`, `sm:flex-row`, and `gap-4` for creating responsive layouts.

The `BookingDetailsPage` component underwent several iterations, mainly focused on refining the layout and presentation of "Customer Service" and "Sales Person" information in the header using Tailwind CSS classes like `space-y-1`, `text-sm`, `leading-tight`, and `font-semibold`. The initial styling used `h6` and `p` tags.

The `App.tsx` file, representing the main application routing, remained largely unchanged except for the inclusion of the `BookingDetailsPage` component in the routing configuration at 5:00:21 PM.


Notable timestamps include:

* **5:00:07 PM:**  `BookingDetailsPage` was initially created, simply rendering the `BookingDetails` component.
* **5:01:33 PM:**  `BookingDetailsPage` was updated to pass initial values and a 'formAction' prop to `BookingDetails`.
* **5:05:33 PM:** `BookingDetails` was significantly altered to accept `initialValues` and `formAction` props from `BookingDetailsPage` and to use `useNavigate` for redirection after form submission.  The MUI styling is still present.
* **5:28:56 PM:**  Major changes in `BookingDetails`, removing the MUI components and converting to Tailwind CSS.  The process continues in subsequent commits.
* **6:33:40 PM:** The `Tracking Details` button in `BookingDetails` is added.
* **6:41:33 PM:** The second `Tracking Details` button is removed.


A recurring theme is the inclusion of commented-out code from previous versions using Material UI components within the `BookingDetails` component. This suggests a gradual migration to a new styling system and a refactoring process.  The `BookingDetails` component also features a hidden input field (`type="hidden"`) for `customer_email_id`, which is unclear from the limited context. There is also a misspelling of "Consignee" as "Consginee" which is repeatedly used across many commits. The final commit shows the transition to a more streamlined layout using tailwind and removes unnecessary commented-out code.
