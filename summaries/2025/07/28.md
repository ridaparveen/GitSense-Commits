# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 10:07:37 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to invoice generation and customer details within a React application.  The `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` component underwent the most significant changes between 9:10:09 AM and 9:32:22 AM.  These changes involved refactoring the component to utilize a `useState` hook to manage invoice data, transitioning from directly rendering invoice details to dynamically populating them from the `invoiceData` state object. This improved code maintainability and readability. The changes also involved a consistent update to the styling and structure to ensure better presentation in PDF format.  The changes made to `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` at  9:24:10 AM and 9:24:41 AM show a shift towards using `invoiceData` object properties directly for populating the invoice fields.

The `InvoiceTable.tsx` component was modified between 9:33:39 AM and 9:36:05 AM, primarily simplifying the styling and structure of the component and removing some redundant code.  The most notable change is that unnecessary styling components were removed, leading to the simplification and cleaning of the component. Before the changes, the component contained hardcoded data; after the changes, the component renders data passed as props. This change makes the component reusable across different parts of the application.

Finally, `GstRejistrtaionDetails.tsx` and `AddGstRejistrationPopupForm.tsx` were updated with new components and functionality to manage GST registration details.  These changes show the addition of  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for GST registration details, and  utilize Redux for managing the state of the GST registration list.  The `AlertMapping.tsx` component shows a series of small changes focused on simplifying the layout and removing unnecessary code,  but the core functionality remains the same.  The most significant change in this component happened between 9:55:01 AM and 10:03:49 AM which involved the removal of action buttons from the table.
