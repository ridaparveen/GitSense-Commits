# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 12:42:49 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application, specifically focusing on a "Box Plan Details" form and page.  The development spanned approximately one hour on July 24th, 2025.


Initial commits (11:55 AM - 11:58 AM) involved creating basic placeholder components for `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` and `BoxPlanDetailsPage.tsx`, and then integrating them into the main application routing (`App.tsx`), which appears to manage various pages related to import/export logistics. A `Breadcrumb` component was also created to enhance navigation.


Significant changes occurred between 12:02 PM and 12:17 PM in `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx`. This component evolved from a simple placeholder to a more complex form including:

*   MUI components (`Box`, `Card`, `CardContent`, `Grid`, `Stack`, `Typography`) for layout and styling.
*   Custom components (`CustomPaper`, `InputDropdown`, `AppDatePicker`, `InputBox`, `AppButton`, `AutoComplete`) suggesting a reusable component library.
*   An `MblContainerDetails` component, likely for displaying container-specific information.
*   A `ClientGrid` component was added to display "Planned Shipping Bills," initially with placeholder data. The grid's columns were progressively refined to include "Shipping Bill No.", "CBM", "Gr.Wt.", "Pkgs", "POD", "FPD", and "Cargo Type".  Radio buttons were also included to allow row selection.


Around 12:27 PM, a dedicated file `box-plan-coulms.tsx` was created to house the column definitions for the `ClientGrid`, improving code organization and reusability.  The `boxPlanCoulmns` function was further refined to accept `selectedRowId` and `setSelectedRowId` states to manage the selected row in the grid.


Finally, at 12:30 PM and 12:37 PM,  type definitions for the form data (`box-panel.types.ts`) were added and expanded to accurately reflect the form's structure, including interfaces for `FilterConfig`, `RowData`, `EstimatedShipBillDetails`, and `PlannedShipBills`.  The `BoxPlanFormValues` interface was significantly updated to incorporate arrays for `estimatedShipBillDetails` and `plannedShipBills`.  This suggests a shift towards managing multiple shipping bill entries.
