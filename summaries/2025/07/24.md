# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 12:42:49 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application, specifically focusing on a "Box Plan Details" form and page.  The development spanned approximately one hour on July 24th, 2025.


Initial commits (11:55 AM - 11:58 AM) involved creating basic placeholder components for `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` and `BoxPlanDetailsPage.tsx`, and then integrating them into the main application routing (`App.tsx`), which appears to manage various pages related to import/export logistics. A `Breadcrumb` component was also created to enhance navigation.


Significant changes occurred between 12:02 PM and 12:17 PM in `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx`. This component evolved from a simple placeholder to a more complex form including:

*   MUI components (`Box`, `Card`, `CardContent`, `Grid`, `Stack`, `Typography`) for layout and styling.
*   Custom components (`CustomPaper`, `InputDropdown`, `AppDatePicker`, `InputBox`, `AppButton`, `AutoComplete`) suggesting a reusable component library.
*   An `MblContainerDetails` component, likely for displaying container-specific information.
*   A `ClientGrid` component was added to display "Planned Shipping Bills," initially with placeholder data. The grid's columns were progressively refined to include "Shipping Bill No.", "CBM", "Gr.Wt.", "Pkgs", "POD", "FPD", and "Cargo Type".  Radio buttons were also included to allow row selection.


Around 12:27 PM, a dedicated file `box-plan-coulms.tsx` was created to house the column definitions for the `ClientGrid`, improving code organization and reusability.  The `boxPlanCoulmns` function was further refined to accept `selectedRowId` and `setSelectedRowId` states to manage the selected row in the grid.


Finally, at 12:30 PM and 12:37 PM,  type definitions for the form data (`box-panel.types.ts`) were added and expanded to accurately reflect the form's structure, including interfaces for `FilterConfig`, `RowData`, `EstimatedShipBillDetails`, and `PlannedShipBills`.  The `BoxPlanFormValues` interface was significantly updated to incorporate arrays for `estimatedShipBillDetails` and `plannedShipBills`.  This suggests a shift towards managing multiple shipping bill entries.


## 11:12:42 PM
The log shows a series of code changes made between 12:46 PM and 5:25 PM on July 24, 2025, primarily focused on the development of a "Box Plan" feature within a React application.  Several files were modified, with the most significant changes occurring in `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` and `EstimatedShippingBills.tsx`.

`box-panel.types.ts` (7/24/2025, 12:46 PM and 7/24/2025, 12:48 PM):  This file defines TypeScript interfaces for data structures used in the Box Plan form.  A notable change between the two timestamps is the alteration of `total_cbm` and `total_gr_wt` types in `BoxPlanFormValues` from `number` to `string`.  This suggests a change in how these values are handled or stored.

`BoxPlanDetailsPage.tsx` (7/24/2025, 12:48 PM and 7/24/2025, 12:48 PM): Minor updates were made to the component's rendering logic.  The `initialvalues` prop was moved from `ScreenToolbar` to `BoxPlanDetailsForm`.  This is a relatively minor change impacting component interaction.

`BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` (7/24/2025, 12:50 PM to 7/24/2025, 3:13 PM):  This component, a form for inputting box plan details, underwent substantial revision. Changes include:  adding formik `name` attribute to input fields, adding error handling with `formik.errors` for relevant fields, populating `AutoComplete` components with options (e.g., "Cont1" for Container No and "SHANGAI" for POD), and finally incorporating the `EstimatedShippingBills` and `PlannedShippingBills` components. This evolution shows the progressive implementation of the form functionality and its integration with other components.

`EstimatedShippingBills.tsx` (7/24/2025, 12:58 PM to 7/24/2025, 2:55 PM): This component, displaying and managing estimated shipping bills, was refactored multiple times. The significant change involves switching the data source from `mblDetailsFormSlice` in Redux to `boxPlanDetailsFormSlice`, aligning it with the overall Box Plan data management.  The component also transitioned from using `InputBoxExtend` and `SelectBoxExtend` to `AutoComplete` and `InputBoxExtend` for improved user experience and potentially data handling.

`boxPlanDetailsSlice.ts` (7/24/2025, 2:46 PM to 7/24/2025, 2:48 PM): This Redux slice manages the state for the Box Plan form. It shows a transition from a simpler structure to a more detailed state representation, separating `estimatedShipList` and `plannedShipList`. This change is crucial for handling the different sections of the box plan form.

`store.ts` (7/24/2025, 2:49 PM): The Redux store configuration was updated to include the `boxPlanDetailsFormReducer`. This step is necessary to integrate the Box Plan state management into the application's central state management system.

`PlannedShippingBills.tsx` (7/24/2025, 2:58 PM to 7/24/2025, 3:08 PM): Similar to `EstimatedShippingBills.tsx`, this component was updated to use the `boxPlanDetailsFormSlice` in Redux.  It also refined the input fields to use appropriate `formik` properties and  added more UI components for a more complete form.

`KeyPersonal.tsx` and `KeyPersonalPopupForm.tsx` (7/24/2025, 4:51 PM to 7:25 PM): These files are related to a customer/vendor details section, seemingly unrelated to the Box Plan feature.  The `KeyPersonal.tsx` component was modified to display Key Personal details instead of GST registration details, using the `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn` from `vendor-columns.tsx`. The `KeyPersonalPopupForm.tsx` component, initially a form for GST registration, was reworked to handle Key Personal details but eventually had its form inputs commented out.

`vendor-columns.tsx` (7/24/2025, 4:57 PM):  This file defines columns for both GST registration and key personnel details tables.

In summary, the majority of the changes focused on building and refining the Box Plan form, involving significant adjustments to data structures, Redux integration, and component interactions. The final changes seem to involve a parallel effort on adding a customer/vendor details section.  The consistent use of `formik` throughout the `BoxPlan` components indicates a strong focus on form validation and management.  The later edits to `KeyPersonalPopupForm.tsx` suggest an unfinished or experimental phase within that section of the application.
