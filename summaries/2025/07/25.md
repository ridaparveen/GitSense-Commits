# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 11:56:50 AM
The log shows two significant code changes on July 25, 2025.

The first change, at 11:21:34 AM, modifies `AlertMapping.tsx`. This component is updated to manage a list of alerts, allowing users to add, update, and delete rows.  The updates include using `react-redux` for state management, with actions (`addList`, `updateList`, `removeList`) dispatching changes to `boxPlanDetailsSlice`. The UI utilizes MUI components for rendering a table with editable fields (using `InputBoxExtend` and `AutoComplete` components) and interactive buttons for row manipulation.  The alert options are hardcoded within the component.


The second change, at 11:22:41 AM, updates `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx`. This component renders a tax invoice PDF, displaying header information (company details, invoice number, date), invoice recipient details, shipping information (including HB/L, MB/L numbers, vessel details, etc.), an invoice table summarizing amounts, and footer information (bank details, terms and conditions, and signature details). The styling leverages MUI components (`Box`, `Paper`, `Typography`, `Table`, `Grid`, etc.) and custom styled components for specific formatting.  The component utilizes placeholder images (`/placeholder.svg`) which may need replacement with actual image sources.


## 1:07:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` component between 12:04 PM and 12:47 PM on July 25, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was improving the visual layout and styling of the tax invoice.

Initially, the `TaxInvoiceBox` had a `backgroundColor` of "#666". This was subsequently changed to "#000000B2", then to "#333", maintaining a dark background color but with minor variations in the shade and transparency. The color of the text within this box was also adjusted, going from white to "#FFFFFF". Several padding and margin adjustments were made to `TaxInvoiceBox` and `HeaderBox` throughout the revisions to fine-tune the spacing and alignment of elements.

The most significant change occurred around 12:10 PM, involving the reordering of the "TAX INVOICE" box and the company header, resulting in improved visual presentation.  Further refinements to the positioning and styling of the QR code and the logo image (`invoice-logo.png` replacing `/placeholder.svg`) took place throughout the subsequent revisions.  The size of the QR code was also adjusted. Finally, the IRN number and Acknowledgement information received a styled box for better visual separation.

The `App.tsx` file was updated once at 12:02 PM on July 25, 2025. This update involved adding routing for various pages within a React application, covering features such as login, dashboard, enquiry, booking, MBL (Master Bill of Lading), customer management, vessel management, vendor management, invoice generation, and more.  The extensive routing suggests a comprehensive logistics or shipping management application.
