# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 11:56:50 AM
The log shows two significant code changes on July 25, 2025.

The first change, at 11:21:34 AM, modifies `AlertMapping.tsx`. This component is updated to manage a list of alerts, allowing users to add, update, and delete rows.  The updates include using `react-redux` for state management, with actions (`addList`, `updateList`, `removeList`) dispatching changes to `boxPlanDetailsSlice`. The UI utilizes MUI components for rendering a table with editable fields (using `InputBoxExtend` and `AutoComplete` components) and interactive buttons for row manipulation.  The alert options are hardcoded within the component.


The second change, at 11:22:41 AM, updates `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx`. This component renders a tax invoice PDF, displaying header information (company details, invoice number, date), invoice recipient details, shipping information (including HB/L, MB/L numbers, vessel details, etc.), an invoice table summarizing amounts, and footer information (bank details, terms and conditions, and signature details). The styling leverages MUI components (`Box`, `Paper`, `Typography`, `Table`, `Grid`, etc.) and custom styled components for specific formatting.  The component utilizes placeholder images (`/placeholder.svg`) which may need replacement with actual image sources.


## 1:07:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx` component between 12:04 PM and 12:47 PM on July 25, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was improving the visual layout and styling of the tax invoice.

Initially, the `TaxInvoiceBox` had a `backgroundColor` of "#666". This was subsequently changed to "#000000B2", then to "#333", maintaining a dark background color but with minor variations in the shade and transparency. The color of the text within this box was also adjusted, going from white to "#FFFFFF". Several padding and margin adjustments were made to `TaxInvoiceBox` and `HeaderBox` throughout the revisions to fine-tune the spacing and alignment of elements.

The most significant change occurred around 12:10 PM, involving the reordering of the "TAX INVOICE" box and the company header, resulting in improved visual presentation.  Further refinements to the positioning and styling of the QR code and the logo image (`invoice-logo.png` replacing `/placeholder.svg`) took place throughout the subsequent revisions.  The size of the QR code was also adjusted. Finally, the IRN number and Acknowledgement information received a styled box for better visual separation.

The `App.tsx` file was updated once at 12:02 PM on July 25, 2025. This update involved adding routing for various pages within a React application, covering features such as login, dashboard, enquiry, booking, MBL (Master Bill of Lading), customer management, vessel management, vendor management, invoice generation, and more.  The extensive routing suggests a comprehensive logistics or shipping management application.


## 3:13:13 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx`, a React component likely rendering a tax invoice.  Changes primarily focus on the layout and styling of the invoice, using MUI (Material UI) components.

The earliest revisions (1:07 PM) establish the basic structure of the invoice, including header information (company details, logo, QR code), a "TAX INVOICE" box with invoice number and date, invoice recipient details, shipping information (HBL/MBl numbers, dates, ports, vessel, weight, dimensions, shipper, consignee), container number and sales person, and a table summarizing invoice amounts.  These early versions employed nested `<Box>` and `<Grid>` components for layout, with styling applied via MUI's `styled` component.

Later revisions (1:07-1:15 PM) involve refinements to layout, primarily spacing and alignment within the `<Grid>` containers. The spacing values in the `Grid` component were adjusted multiple times.  There are a few attempts at restructuring the layout of shipping details, with Grid items being rearranged and reorganized in different attempts. A slight change in the "Pkgs/Weight" section is noticeable in some versions, having a space between the number and the unit.

Around 1:15 PM, a significant change occurs with the introduction of a more structured approach to shipping details using a styled `<Box>` and separating information into left and right columns.  The redundant repetitions of the same shipping information are removed. This version also includes more detailed Terms & Conditions and a signature section.

Between 1:21 PM and 1:24 PM, the code was refactored to introduce `renderRow` and `InfoRow` helper components to reduce code duplication.  This refactoring improved the code's readability.

The 1:31 PM and onward revisions continue focusing on improving the presentation and layout of the shipping details by introducing a `DetailRow` component to handle the styling of each row of the shipping information.  They explore alternative ways to display the data such as a different `<Box>` and other `<Grid>` layouts.  Between 2:23 PM and 2:59 PM more iterations happened in which repeated elements and extra `box` and `Grid` elements were removed. Multiple changes were made to improve the structure and reduce the redundancy within the shipping details, ultimately consolidating to a cleaner presentation that is easily manageable. At 2:50 PM, a significant refactoring uses a `data` object to consolidate shipping details, improving maintainability and further reducing code redundancy by using a map for the shipping data.  The final changes continue this refinement and focus on ensuring a concise and organized display of the shipping information with improved layout and consistency.  The final structure uses a combination of styled `Box` and `Grid` elements for layout, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.


The `CargoDetails.tsx` file shows a Formik form for handling cargo details.  A few revisions show commented-out sections (around 1:26 PM), suggesting features were temporarily disabled or removed.  The final version of this component seems complete with inputs for commodity, customer remarks, number of packages, gross weight, package type, volume, chargeable volume, HAZ, UN number, and IMCO code. The UI adapts to screen size using `useMediaQuery`.
