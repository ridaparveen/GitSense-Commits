# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 11:56:50 AM
The log shows two significant code changes on July 25, 2025.

The first change, at 11:21:34 AM, modifies `AlertMapping.tsx`. This component is updated to manage a list of alerts, allowing users to add, update, and delete rows.  The updates include using `react-redux` for state management, with actions (`addList`, `updateList`, `removeList`) dispatching changes to `boxPlanDetailsSlice`. The UI utilizes MUI components for rendering a table with editable fields (using `InputBoxExtend` and `AutoComplete` components) and interactive buttons for row manipulation.  The alert options are hardcoded within the component.


The second change, at 11:22:41 AM, updates `TaxInvoicePdf.tsx`. This component renders a tax invoice PDF, displaying header information (company details, invoice number, date), invoice recipient details, shipping information (including HB/L, MB/L numbers, vessel details, etc.), an invoice table summarizing amounts, and footer information (bank details, terms and conditions, and signature details). The styling leverages MUI components (`Box`, `Paper`, `Typography`, `Table`, `Grid`, etc.) and custom styled components for specific formatting.  The component utilizes placeholder images (`/placeholder.svg`) which may need replacement with actual image sources.
