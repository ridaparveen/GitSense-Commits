# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 10:41:21 AM
The `bookingService.ts` file underwent a minor modification between 10:12:26 AM and 10:14:40 AM on July 15, 2025.  The change involved a correction within the `setWhereClause` function of the `BookingQueryBuilder` class.  Specifically, the conditional logic determining the `userWhere` clause was altered. The original code only considered roles "ADMIN" and "CUSTOMER" or "SPR_CUSTOMER".  The updated code adds the "AGENT" role to the condition where the `abe.customer` field is used for filtering.  The rest of the code remained unchanged.  The core functionality—building queries for retrieving and managing booking data—remained consistent.  The update improves the accuracy of user-based filtering by including the "AGENT" role in the appropriate conditional logic.


## 12:41:22 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `booking-form.tsx`, a React component for a booking form.  The main changes revolve around the handling of initial values and the `container_type` field.

The first two entries (12:09:23 PM and 12:09:56 PM) differ only in the `initialValues` prop within the `useFormik` hook. Specifically, the `container_type` field's initial value changed from accessing `bookingData?.container_type` to `bookingData?.container_types`. This suggests a potential correction to the data structure accessed from the `bookingData` object.  The time difference between these two commits is very short, suggesting a quick fix or typo correction.


The third entry (12:11:18 PM) is identical to the second entry.  This may indicate an accidental duplicate commit or a rollback of a change not visible in this log excerpt.  There are no substantive differences between the second and third revisions.

The component uses Formik for form management, integrates with a backend API (`useSaveBookingMutation`, `useLazyFetchApprixTimeDataQuery`), and employs various UI components from a common component library (`@components`).  The form includes fields for transport mode, booking type, PO number, reference number, container type, dimensions, weight, and port of loading/discharge. Autocomplete functionality is used for port selection, and the form handles error messages and loading states.  The `useEffect` hook fetches approximate transit times based on Port of Loading (POL) and Port of Discharge (POD) selections.


## 12:41:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `bookingService.ts` file between 11:13 AM and 12:39 PM on July 15, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is on refining the `BookingQueryBuilder` class, specifically its `buildSelectQuery` method. This method constructs SQL queries for retrieving booking data.

Early revisions involved adjustments to the selected columns in the query, adding and removing `abe.agent_booking_id` and  `abe.lastmodifieddate`.  There's also a recurring theme of improving error handling, particularly within the `getAll` function. This function fetches booking information based on various query parameters and returns it as a JSON response.

A significant change occurred around 11:57 AM, where the `agent_booking_container_pre` table was joined using a subquery that uses `STRING_AGG` to aggregate `container_type` and `no_of_container` into comma-separated strings, improving data representation.  Further refinements between 12:01 PM and 12:20 PM focused on handling potential non-numeric values in the `no_of_container` field within the subquery by adding a `CASE` statement to only include numeric values in the sum, making the query more robust. The `CASE` statement was refined again at 12:14 PM to use `trim()` on `no_of_container` before checking for numeric values.

Finally, around 12:20 PM, the `SUM` aggregate function was removed from the subquery in favor of using `STRING_AGG` for `no_of_container` also, changing the output to show all values and not the sum.  The final changes at 12:23 PM and 12:24 PM involved removing unnecessary `console.log` statements and ensuring consistency in the query. The `setWhereClause` method was simplified, removing a redundant `console.log` statement.  All revisions concern the same file and demonstrate iterative development and debugging.


## 5:09:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a booking system's backend code, primarily focused on the `booking.ts` type definitions and `bookingService.ts` which handles booking logic.  Changes span from 12:45 PM to 2:59 PM on July 15, 2025.

**`booking.ts` Changes:**

The `booking.ts` file underwent several minor revisions, mostly involving the `BookingStatus` enum. Initially, it included `ALL` status along with other booking statuses.  Later, `ALL` was removed, then re-added in subsequent commits.  The key change within `BookingStatus` is the replacement of `"PENDING"` with `"NOT_APPROVED"` reflecting a more accurate representation of the booking's state. No other significant alterations to the interface definitions occurred.

**`bookingService.ts` Changes:**

The `bookingService.ts` file contains the core booking logic.  The most significant changes revolve around the `BookingQueryBuilder` class and the `getAll` function.  The `BookingQueryBuilder` constructs complex SQL queries based on user roles and various filter parameters (page, perPage, type, orderBy, agent_booking_id, pol, pod, shipper, status, booking_type, fromDate, toDate).  Specific adjustments involved enhancing the query building capabilities  to improve the filtering of booking statuses.  The `getAll` function uses the `BookingQueryBuilder` to fetch and return booking data. Initially it calculated counts incorrectly, but this was corrected in later revisions. A notable modification in the `getAll` function is the conditional application of the `status` filter only when the `type` is set to `BookingStatus.ALL`. This optimization avoids unnecessary filtering and improves efficiency.  There are also minor changes in formatting and logging statements throughout.  The `saveBooking` function remains largely unchanged, primarily dealing with data sanitization and formatting before persistence.


The repeated updates to `booking.ts` and `bookingService.ts` suggest an iterative development process focused on refining the booking status handling and query logic for better accuracy and performance.  The consistent use of `sanitizeString` indicates a focus on input validation and security. The code relies heavily on SQL queries with joins across multiple tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_po`, `agent_booking_cargolist`, `agent_booking_container_pre`, `agent_booking_conversation`), indicating a relational database is used.


## 5:09:28 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `booking-dashboard.tsx` and `shipment-page.tsx` components, along with their associated data files (`booking-coulmns.tsx` and `global.ts`).  The changes span several hours on July 15th, 2025.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\booking\booking-dashboard.tsx`**:

This file underwent several iterations focusing primarily on refining the display of booking statuses.  Early revisions involved mapping backend status values ("NOT_APPROVED", "NEW", etc.) to frontend labels ("Pending", "New", etc.). Later revisions simplified this mapping by using a dedicated `BACKEND_TO_FRONTEND_STATUS` object from `global.ts` and removed redundant `statusDisplayMap`. The most significant change is the replacement of  `bookingDashboardCartData?.counts?.all`  with  `bookingDashboardCartData?.counts?.new` in the "New Booking" card to improve accuracy in displaying new bookings.  The final change, around 2:16 PM and 2:17 PM, removed commented-out code related to the previous, more complex status mapping.  A further refinement at 2:31 PM involved adjusting how status options are mapped in the filter sidebar, using `mapStatusOptions` function that takes advantage of `BACKEND_TO_FRONTEND_STATUS`

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\data\options\global.ts`**:

This file contains various status and role definitions. A key change at 2:56 PM was the introduction of `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_STATUS`, a new object used for mapping backend booking statuses to frontend representations, replacing the previous method. This object is used in the `booking-dashboard.tsx` component

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\data\coulmns\booking-coulmns.tsx`**:

Minor code cleanup occurred at 2:28 PM and 2:29 PM, primarily concerning formatting and removing unnecessary parentheses,  but the core logic of the function defining columns for the booking grid remained largely the same. The main change was updating  `BACKEND_TO_FRONTEND_STATUS` to `BOOKING_DASHBOARD_STATUS` at 2:57 PM in line with the changes made in `global.ts`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\shipment-page.tsx`**:

This file, representing a shipment dashboard, underwent extensive revisions between 3:21 PM and 4:39 PM.  The initial changes were focused on refining the filtering mechanisms (handling of `pol` and `pod` filters) and adding a loading indicator (`Loader` component). Later revisions (starting around 4:25 PM) involved adding more sophisticated status filtering logic, indicated by the introduction of the `isStatusFiltered` variable and a commented-out `STATUS_COLORS` object.  Further changes around 4:30 PM added a more comprehensive approach to handling active filters and updated the styling of the status badge using `SHIPMENT_STATUS` from `global.ts`. The final revision around 4:37 PM involved a simplification of the active filter check (`hasActiveFilters`)  and improvements to the UI elements.  The final version introduces a DatePeriodSelector for selecting time periods.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns**:

*   Consistent use of Redux for state management (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`).
*   Frequent updates to filtering and pagination logic across components.
*   Extensive use of functional components and hooks in React.
*   Use of MUI (`@mui/x-data-grid`) for data grids.
*   Repetitive use of similar patterns for handling filter changes and updates, showing a consistent approach to state updates.
*   The incorporation of loading and fetching indicators to enhance the user experience.


The overall pattern indicates a development process involving iterative refinement of UI components and the underlying data handling logic, with a focus on improving the user interface and data consistency across the application.
