# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 10:41:21 AM
The `bookingService.ts` file underwent a minor modification between 10:12:26 AM and 10:14:40 AM on July 15, 2025.  The change involved a correction within the `setWhereClause` function of the `BookingQueryBuilder` class.  Specifically, the conditional logic determining the `userWhere` clause was altered. The original code only considered roles "ADMIN" and "CUSTOMER" or "SPR_CUSTOMER".  The updated code adds the "AGENT" role to the condition where the `abe.customer` field is used for filtering.  The rest of the code remained unchanged.  The core functionality—building queries for retrieving and managing booking data—remained consistent.  The update improves the accuracy of user-based filtering by including the "AGENT" role in the appropriate conditional logic.


## 12:41:22 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `booking-form.tsx`, a React component for a booking form.  The main changes revolve around the handling of initial values and the `container_type` field.

The first two entries (12:09:23 PM and 12:09:56 PM) differ only in the `initialValues` prop within the `useFormik` hook. Specifically, the `container_type` field's initial value changed from accessing `bookingData?.container_type` to `bookingData?.container_types`. This suggests a potential correction to the data structure accessed from the `bookingData` object.  The time difference between these two commits is very short, suggesting a quick fix or typo correction.


The third entry (12:11:18 PM) is identical to the second entry.  This may indicate an accidental duplicate commit or a rollback of a change not visible in this log excerpt.  There are no substantive differences between the second and third revisions.

The component uses Formik for form management, integrates with a backend API (`useSaveBookingMutation`, `useLazyFetchApprixTimeDataQuery`), and employs various UI components from a common component library (`@components`).  The form includes fields for transport mode, booking type, PO number, reference number, container type, dimensions, weight, and port of loading/discharge. Autocomplete functionality is used for port selection, and the form handles error messages and loading states.  The `useEffect` hook fetches approximate transit times based on Port of Loading (POL) and Port of Discharge (POD) selections.
