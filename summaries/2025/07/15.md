# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 10:41:21 AM
The `bookingService.ts` file underwent a minor modification between 10:12:26 AM and 10:14:40 AM on July 15, 2025.  The change involved a correction within the `setWhereClause` function of the `BookingQueryBuilder` class.  Specifically, the conditional logic determining the `userWhere` clause was altered. The original code only considered roles "ADMIN" and "CUSTOMER" or "SPR_CUSTOMER".  The updated code adds the "AGENT" role to the condition where the `abe.customer` field is used for filtering.  The rest of the code remained unchanged.  The core functionality—building queries for retrieving and managing booking data—remained consistent.  The update improves the accuracy of user-based filtering by including the "AGENT" role in the appropriate conditional logic.


## 12:41:22 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `booking-form.tsx`, a React component for a booking form.  The main changes revolve around the handling of initial values and the `container_type` field.

The first two entries (12:09:23 PM and 12:09:56 PM) differ only in the `initialValues` prop within the `useFormik` hook. Specifically, the `container_type` field's initial value changed from accessing `bookingData?.container_type` to `bookingData?.container_types`. This suggests a potential correction to the data structure accessed from the `bookingData` object.  The time difference between these two commits is very short, suggesting a quick fix or typo correction.


The third entry (12:11:18 PM) is identical to the second entry.  This may indicate an accidental duplicate commit or a rollback of a change not visible in this log excerpt.  There are no substantive differences between the second and third revisions.

The component uses Formik for form management, integrates with a backend API (`useSaveBookingMutation`, `useLazyFetchApprixTimeDataQuery`), and employs various UI components from a common component library (`@components`).  The form includes fields for transport mode, booking type, PO number, reference number, container type, dimensions, weight, and port of loading/discharge. Autocomplete functionality is used for port selection, and the form handles error messages and loading states.  The `useEffect` hook fetches approximate transit times based on Port of Loading (POL) and Port of Discharge (POD) selections.


## 12:41:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `bookingService.ts` file between 11:13 AM and 12:39 PM on July 15, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is on refining the `BookingQueryBuilder` class, specifically its `buildSelectQuery` method. This method constructs SQL queries for retrieving booking data.

Early revisions involved adjustments to the selected columns in the query, adding and removing `abe.agent_booking_id` and  `abe.lastmodifieddate`.  There's also a recurring theme of improving error handling, particularly within the `getAll` function. This function fetches booking information based on various query parameters and returns it as a JSON response.

A significant change occurred around 11:57 AM, where the `agent_booking_container_pre` table was joined using a subquery that uses `STRING_AGG` to aggregate `container_type` and `no_of_container` into comma-separated strings, improving data representation.  Further refinements between 12:01 PM and 12:20 PM focused on handling potential non-numeric values in the `no_of_container` field within the subquery by adding a `CASE` statement to only include numeric values in the sum, making the query more robust. The `CASE` statement was refined again at 12:14 PM to use `trim()` on `no_of_container` before checking for numeric values.

Finally, around 12:20 PM, the `SUM` aggregate function was removed from the subquery in favor of using `STRING_AGG` for `no_of_container` also, changing the output to show all values and not the sum.  The final changes at 12:23 PM and 12:24 PM involved removing unnecessary `console.log` statements and ensuring consistency in the query. The `setWhereClause` method was simplified, removing a redundant `console.log` statement.  All revisions concern the same file and demonstrate iterative development and debugging.
