# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 10:41:21 AM
The `bookingService.ts` file underwent a minor modification between 10:12:26 AM and 10:14:40 AM on July 15, 2025.  The change involved a correction within the `setWhereClause` function of the `BookingQueryBuilder` class.  Specifically, the conditional logic determining the `userWhere` clause was altered. The original code only considered roles "ADMIN" and "CUSTOMER" or "SPR_CUSTOMER".  The updated code adds the "AGENT" role to the condition where the `abe.customer` field is used for filtering.  The rest of the code remained unchanged.  The core functionality—building queries for retrieving and managing booking data—remained consistent.  The update improves the accuracy of user-based filtering by including the "AGENT" role in the appropriate conditional logic.
