# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 9:39:42 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `booking-form.tsx` and `shipment-page.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 25 minutes, between 6:00 PM and 6:25 PM on July 9th, 2025.

**`booking-form.tsx` (multiple updates):**  This component is a booking form.  The major changes involve refining the initial values passed to `useFormik`. Initially, the `transport_mode` default value was set to "Ocean", but this was later changed to an empty string.  There are no other significant functional changes observed across the multiple updates within this time frame, suggesting minor adjustments or bug fixes rather than large-scale feature additions.


**`shipment-page.tsx` (multiple updates):** This component renders a shipment dashboard.  The most significant change is the addition of a `<DatePeriodSelector>` component to the `<PageWrapper.Right>` section and the subsequent re-organization and adjustments to the layout of the cards and filter components. The initial version lacked this date selector, which is then added in the `<PageWrapper.Right>`, `<div className="flex gap-3 mb-6 w-full">` and `<PageWrapper.Content>`. This suggests a UI improvement focused on date filtering for the shipment data.  There are also minor changes to the styling and layout of certain elements, and repetition in the rendering of some card components (Average Transit Time) in a few commits, likely indicating experimentation and adjustments during development.  The overall pattern in the `shipment-page.tsx` updates shows iterative refinement of the UI, focusing on the layout and incorporation of date selection features.
