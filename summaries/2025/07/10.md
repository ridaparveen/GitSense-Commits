# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 9:39:42 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `booking-form.tsx` and `shipment-page.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 25 minutes, between 6:00 PM and 6:25 PM on July 9th, 2025.

**`booking-form.tsx` (multiple updates):**  This component is a booking form.  The major changes involve refining the initial values passed to `useFormik`. Initially, the `transport_mode` default value was set to "Ocean", but this was later changed to an empty string.  There are no other significant functional changes observed across the multiple updates within this time frame, suggesting minor adjustments or bug fixes rather than large-scale feature additions.


**`shipment-page.tsx` (multiple updates):** This component renders a shipment dashboard.  The most significant change is the addition of a `<DatePeriodSelector>` component to the `<PageWrapper.Right>` section and the subsequent re-organization and adjustments to the layout of the cards and filter components. The initial version lacked this date selector, which is then added in the `<PageWrapper.Right>`, `<div className="flex gap-3 mb-6 w-full">` and `<PageWrapper.Content>`. This suggests a UI improvement focused on date filtering for the shipment data.  There are also minor changes to the styling and layout of certain elements, and repetition in the rendering of some card components (Average Transit Time) in a few commits, likely indicating experimentation and adjustments during development.  The overall pattern in the `shipment-page.tsx` updates shows iterative refinement of the UI, focusing on the layout and incorporation of date selection features.


## 9:39:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `bookingService.ts` file and one revision of `booking.ts`.  All changes are within the same directory,  `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src`.

The `booking.ts` file (timestamp: 7/9/2025, 6:04:16 PM) defines TypeScript interfaces and enums related to booking information.  The key changes are the introduction of  `BookingPayloadTypes`, `BookingRequestBody`, `AuthReqUser`, `EntryMode`, `BookingStatus`, and `BookingQueryType` interfaces, clarifying data structures for booking requests, responses, user authentication, and query parameters.


The `bookingService.ts` file undergoes several revisions between 4:55 PM and 6:12 PM on July 9, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the `BookingQueryBuilder` class. The `BookingQueryBuilder` is extensively modified to handle various query conditions, including:


* **Filtering by Booking Status:**  The `setWhereClause` method allows filtering bookings based on their status (Pending, Approved, Cancelled, or All).
* **Search and Filtering:** The `addSearchClause` and `addFilterClause` methods add search and filter conditions respectively to the query, allowing for flexible data retrieval.
* **Date Range Filtering:** The `addDateRangeClause` and `setDateRange` methods enable filtering based on booking dates.
* **Query Building:** The `buildSelectQuery`, `buildCountQuery`, and `buildOptionsQuery` methods construct the SQL queries dynamically based on the specified parameters.  These methods are improved to handle edge cases and enhance robustness.
* **Error Handling:**  The `getAll` function includes a `try...catch` block to manage potential errors during database interaction.
* **Data Sanitization:** The `saveBooking` function uses `sanitizeString` from the `utils/common` module to sanitize input strings before database insertion.


Minor formatting changes (like spacing and line breaks) and a few incomplete lines were also observed in several versions of `bookingService.ts`, indicating ongoing development.  The most significant changes seem to be around 5:50 PM to 5:57 PM  where ternary operators were used to improve readability and maintainability of the code, particularly in the  `setWhereClause` function and the `payload.location` assignment within `saveBooking`.  A `console.log` statement in the `saveBooking` function was also removed around this time, suggesting debugging efforts.  Finally, around 6:11 PM, a `console.log` statement was removed from the `saveBooking` function, further supporting the debugging efforts.
