# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 9:39:42 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `booking-form.tsx` and `shipment-page.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 25 minutes, between 6:00 PM and 6:25 PM on July 9th, 2025.

**`booking-form.tsx` (multiple updates):**  This component is a booking form.  The major changes involve refining the initial values passed to `useFormik`. Initially, the `transport_mode` default value was set to "Ocean", but this was later changed to an empty string.  There are no other significant functional changes observed across the multiple updates within this time frame, suggesting minor adjustments or bug fixes rather than large-scale feature additions.


**`shipment-page.tsx` (multiple updates):** This component renders a shipment dashboard.  The most significant change is the addition of a `<DatePeriodSelector>` component to the `<PageWrapper.Right>` section and the subsequent re-organization and adjustments to the layout of the cards and filter components. The initial version lacked this date selector, which is then added in the `<PageWrapper.Right>`, `<div className="flex gap-3 mb-6 w-full">` and `<PageWrapper.Content>`. This suggests a UI improvement focused on date filtering for the shipment data.  There are also minor changes to the styling and layout of certain elements, and repetition in the rendering of some card components (Average Transit Time) in a few commits, likely indicating experimentation and adjustments during development.  The overall pattern in the `shipment-page.tsx` updates shows iterative refinement of the UI, focusing on the layout and incorporation of date selection features.


## 9:39:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `bookingService.ts` file and one revision of `booking.ts`.  All changes are within the same directory,  `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src`.

The `booking.ts` file (timestamp: 7/9/2025, 6:04:16 PM) defines TypeScript interfaces and enums related to booking information.  The key changes are the introduction of  `BookingPayloadTypes`, `BookingRequestBody`, `AuthReqUser`, `EntryMode`, `BookingStatus`, and `BookingQueryType` interfaces, clarifying data structures for booking requests, responses, user authentication, and query parameters.


The `bookingService.ts` file undergoes several revisions between 4:55 PM and 6:12 PM on July 9, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the `BookingQueryBuilder` class. The `BookingQueryBuilder` is extensively modified to handle various query conditions, including:


* **Filtering by Booking Status:**  The `setWhereClause` method allows filtering bookings based on their status (Pending, Approved, Cancelled, or All).
* **Search and Filtering:** The `addSearchClause` and `addFilterClause` methods add search and filter conditions respectively to the query, allowing for flexible data retrieval.
* **Date Range Filtering:** The `addDateRangeClause` and `setDateRange` methods enable filtering based on booking dates.
* **Query Building:** The `buildSelectQuery`, `buildCountQuery`, and `buildOptionsQuery` methods construct the SQL queries dynamically based on the specified parameters.  These methods are improved to handle edge cases and enhance robustness.
* **Error Handling:**  The `getAll` function includes a `try...catch` block to manage potential errors during database interaction.
* **Data Sanitization:** The `saveBooking` function uses `sanitizeString` from the `utils/common` module to sanitize input strings before database insertion.


Minor formatting changes (like spacing and line breaks) and a few incomplete lines were also observed in several versions of `bookingService.ts`, indicating ongoing development.  The most significant changes seem to be around 5:50 PM to 5:57 PM  where ternary operators were used to improve readability and maintainability of the code, particularly in the  `setWhereClause` function and the `payload.location` assignment within `saveBooking`.  A `console.log` statement in the `saveBooking` function was also removed around this time, suggesting debugging efforts.  Finally, around 6:11 PM, a `console.log` statement was removed from the `saveBooking` function, further supporting the debugging efforts.


## 11:39:33 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `shipment-page.tsx` between 11:21 AM and 11:35 AM on July 10, 2025,  and changes to `shipment-card-info-slice.ts` (11:24 AM) and `DatePeriodSelector.tsx` (11:25 AM).

`shipment-card-info-slice.ts`  received a minor update at 11:24:45 AM, adding a Redux slice to manage shipment card information, specifically date range and period filters.

`DatePeriodSelector.tsx`, updated at 11:25:45 AM, is a component providing a date range and period selection interface.  It includes options for "All Time", "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", "Last 60 days", and "Last 90 days". The component handles date range updates and period changes, updating the state accordingly.


The `shipment-page.tsx` file underwent several revisions.  The most significant changes center around the handling of data fetching and filtering:

* **Initial Version (11:21:34 AM):**  This version fetches shipment data and card data based on filters and pagination.  It displays two cards showing "Average Transit Time" and "Shipment In Transit", using data from `ShipmentCartData`. It includes basic filtering using AutocompleteBoxes for "Port of loading" and "Port of Discharge". The initial default date range is the last 30 days.


* **Subsequent Revisions (11:27:23 AM, 11:29:44 AM, 11:30:17 AM, 11:31:07 AM, 11:35:51 AM):** These revisions primarily focus on refining the data fetching logic in `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery`.  The `skip` option is added to prevent unnecessary API calls when date filters are not set. There are also minor adjustments to the default date range and period set on initial load, and the conditional logic for setting the default date range changed. The default period is set to "All" in some versions and "30" in others. The `useEffect` hook is modified to improve the conditional logic for setting the default date range based on the `hasDateRange` variable.  The UI elements,  specifically cards and autocomplete, remained largely unchanged structurally, but minor styling adjustments may be present within the various commits not explicitly highlighted in the provided log.  The core functionality of data display and filter handling remains consistent throughout the revisions.

In summary, the code evolution focuses on improving the efficiency and logic of data fetching within the shipment page,  while maintaining the basic structure of the UI and core functionality.  The `shipment-card-info-slice` and `DatePeriodSelector` components provide supporting functionality for date range selection and management.


## 1:05:01 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `shipment-page.tsx` and `shipment-coulmns.tsx`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\shipment-page.tsx`**:  This file underwent multiple revisions between 11:43 AM and 11:59 AM on July 10, 2025.  The changes primarily involved the UI for displaying shipment data, particularly the rendering of cards showing average transit time and shipments in transit.  Several `useEffect` hooks manage data fetching and default date ranges.  The core functionality of filtering and pagination using Redux actions (`dashboardSetFilters`, `dashboardSetPagination`) remained consistent throughout the updates.  A notable change was the introduction of  `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` at 11:56:08 AM, enabling navigation to shipment details pages from the notification component.  Later, at 11:59:56 AM, the navigation was further refined by replacing `useNavigate` with `Link` from `react-router-dom`, changing how the "View" button directs the user.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\data\coulmns\shipment-coulmns.tsx`**: This file was updated once at 12:00:50 PM on July 10, 2025. The update involved defining column configurations for a data grid, likely used to display shipment information.  The columns include `mblno`, `pol`, `pod`, `status`, `eta_pod`, `departure_date`, `eta`, `ata`, and `action`.  The `status` column uses a custom `renderCell` function to display a badge with color-coded shipment status and a progress bar representing a numerical value within that status.  The `action` column includes a `Button` component that links to shipment details using the `mblno` (master bill of lading number).  The file also includes a function `useOverviewDashboardColumns` which appears to define a separate set of columns, possibly for a dashboard view.  Both column definitions utilize `Link` from `react-router-dom` for navigating to details page.
