# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 2:04:01 AM
The code changes reflect updates to a React application's booking dashboard functionality.

On July 9th, 2025, at 1:26:42 AM, `booking-dashboard.tsx` was modified. This component displays a booking dashboard, fetching data via Redux.  The update involved enhancements to the UI, adding features like filtering (using a sidebar), sorting, pagination, and search functionality within the booking list.  The dashboard displays booking counts (new, pending, completed, cancelled) using cards and utilizes several UI components from a shared component library (`@components`).  The data fetching leverages a custom `useFetchBookingDashboardDataQuery` hook.  Error handling (isLoading, isFetching) is implemented.  The component also handles navigation to booking details pages.

Subsequently, at 1:30:07 AM on the same day, `booking-api.ts` was updated. This file defines API calls using the `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react` library.  The changes centered around three API endpoints: `saveBooking` (a POST request to save booking data), `fetchApprixTimeData` (a GET request for approximate transit time data), and `fetchBookingDashboardData` (a GET request used by the dashboard component).  Each endpoint includes error handling and utilizes a common `getAppHeaders` function for authentication.  The `invalidatesTags` and `providesTags` options are used for Redux Toolkit's caching and invalidation mechanisms.  The use of URLSearchParams for query parameters is present in both fetch calls.
