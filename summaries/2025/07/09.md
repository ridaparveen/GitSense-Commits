# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 2:04:01 AM
The code changes reflect updates to a React application's booking dashboard functionality.

On July 9th, 2025, at 1:26:42 AM, `booking-dashboard.tsx` was modified. This component displays a booking dashboard, fetching data via Redux.  The update involved enhancements to the UI, adding features like filtering (using a sidebar), sorting, pagination, and search functionality within the booking list.  The dashboard displays booking counts (new, pending, completed, cancelled) using cards and utilizes several UI components from a shared component library (`@components`).  The data fetching leverages a custom `useFetchBookingDashboardDataQuery` hook.  Error handling (isLoading, isFetching) is implemented.  The component also handles navigation to booking details pages.

Subsequently, at 1:30:07 AM on the same day, `booking-api.ts` was updated. This file defines API calls using the `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react` library.  The changes centered around three API endpoints: `saveBooking` (a POST request to save booking data), `fetchApprixTimeData` (a GET request for approximate transit time data), and `fetchBookingDashboardData` (a GET request used by the dashboard component).  Each endpoint includes error handling and utilizes a common `getAppHeaders` function for authentication.  The `invalidatesTags` and `providesTags` options are used for Redux Toolkit's caching and invalidation mechanisms.  The use of URLSearchParams for query parameters is present in both fetch calls.

The log shows significant changes across multiple files within the `t360-frontend-v2` project, primarily focused on shipment and booking dashboards.

The `booking-dashboard-slice.ts` file underwent two revisions on July 9th, 2025, between 10:39:34 AM and 10:39:57 AM.  These changes involved removing commented-out code related to `setDateRange` and `setPeriod` reducers, simplifying the actions exported from the slice.  The core functionality for setting pagination, filters, and sort order remained consistent.  The `sortBy` property in the initial state was corrected to be a string rather than undefined.

The `store.ts` file was updated at 10:41:13 AM to include the `bookingDashboardSlice` and `shipmentCardInfoDashboardSlice` reducers in the application's Redux store.  This signifies the integration of these slices into the application's state management.

The `booking-dashboard.tsx` component saw multiple revisions on July 9th, 2025.  A key change at 10:43:38 AM corrected the `useSelector` hook to correctly access the `bookingDashboardSlice` state instead of `shipmentDashboardSlice`, resolving a data mismatch issue. A further update at 10:46:35 AM modified the `handleClearFilters` function to clear all filter fields. Finally, at 10:57:52 AM, "pending_booking" was renamed to "pending" in the `bookingDashboardCartData` object.

The `shipment-dashboard-slice.ts` file was updated at 10:44:49 AM. This revision maintained the core functionality but added more clarity to the code.

The `shipment-page.tsx` file was extensively modified between 11:31:31 AM and 12:31:42 PM. This involved significant restructuring of the component's UI, including changes to card layout, filter placement, and the addition of a `DatePeriodSelector` component. The most notable change during this time was the addition of a new Redux slice `shipmentCardInfoDashboardSlice`, which is used to manage date filtering for the shipment cards.  The initial state of `shipmentCardInfoDashboardSlice` was updated to reflect 30-day default period instead of 30.  Furthermore, the `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery` hook was modified to incorporate data from this new slice, allowing for dynamic date range selection and affecting the API call parameters used to fetch data.  The final version moved the `DatePeriodSelector` component to the `PageWrapper.Right`, and an useEffect hook was introduced to set default date ranges to 30 days in the past and present if no date is selected.

The `shipment-card-info-slice.ts` file was created at 11:48:18 AM and subsequently modified a couple times to correct the default period from "30" to "30days" in the initial state.  This slice specifically manages date filters for the shipment card data.

The `types/shipment.types.ts` file was updated at 11:52:13 AM to define types related to shipment data, including `DashboardState` and `DashboardCardInfoState`.  This update reflects the changes made to manage the dashboard state.

A recurring pattern across the changes is the consistent use of Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for state management and the frequent updating of pagination states upon filter and sort changes to ensure the dashboard data is correctly refreshed.  The modifications made to `shipment-page.tsx` represent a substantial UI refinement to improve user experience and functionality.
