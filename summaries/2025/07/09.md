# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 2:04:01 AM
The code changes reflect updates to a React application's booking dashboard functionality.

On July 9th, 2025, at 1:26:42 AM, `booking-dashboard.tsx` was modified. This component displays a booking dashboard, fetching data via Redux.  The update involved enhancements to the UI, adding features like filtering (using a sidebar), sorting, pagination, and search functionality within the booking list.  The dashboard displays booking counts (new, pending, completed, cancelled) using cards and utilizes several UI components from a shared component library (`@components`).  The data fetching leverages a custom `useFetchBookingDashboardDataQuery` hook.  Error handling (isLoading, isFetching) is implemented.  The component also handles navigation to booking details pages.

Subsequently, at 1:30:07 AM on the same day, `booking-api.ts` was updated. This file defines API calls using the `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react` library.  The changes centered around three API endpoints: `saveBooking` (a POST request to save booking data), `fetchApprixTimeData` (a GET request for approximate transit time data), and `fetchBookingDashboardData` (a GET request used by the dashboard component).  Each endpoint includes error handling and utilizes a common `getAppHeaders` function for authentication.  The `invalidatesTags` and `providesTags` options are used for Redux Toolkit's caching and invalidation mechanisms.  The use of URLSearchParams for query parameters is present in both fetch calls.


## 12:45:58 PM
The log shows significant changes across multiple files within the `t360-frontend-v2` project, primarily focused on shipment and booking dashboards.

The `booking-dashboard-slice.ts` file underwent two revisions on July 9th, 2025, between 10:39:34 AM and 10:39:57 AM.  These changes involved removing commented-out code related to `setDateRange` and `setPeriod` reducers, simplifying the actions exported from the slice.  The core functionality for setting pagination, filters, and sort order remained consistent.  The `sortBy` property in the initial state was corrected to be a string rather than undefined.

The `store.ts` file was updated at 10:41:13 AM to include the `bookingDashboardSlice` and `shipmentCardInfoDashboardSlice` reducers in the application's Redux store.  This signifies the integration of these slices into the application's state management.

The `booking-dashboard.tsx` component saw multiple revisions on July 9th, 2025.  A key change at 10:43:38 AM corrected the `useSelector` hook to correctly access the `bookingDashboardSlice` state instead of `shipmentDashboardSlice`, resolving a data mismatch issue. A further update at 10:46:35 AM modified the `handleClearFilters` function to clear all filter fields. Finally, at 10:57:52 AM, "pending_booking" was renamed to "pending" in the `bookingDashboardCartData` object.

The `shipment-dashboard-slice.ts` file was updated at 10:44:49 AM. This revision maintained the core functionality but added more clarity to the code.

The `shipment-page.tsx` file was extensively modified between 11:31:31 AM and 12:31:42 PM. This involved significant restructuring of the component's UI, including changes to card layout, filter placement, and the addition of a `DatePeriodSelector` component. The most notable change during this time was the addition of a new Redux slice `shipmentCardInfoDashboardSlice`, which is used to manage date filtering for the shipment cards.  The initial state of `shipmentCardInfoDashboardSlice` was updated to reflect 30-day default period instead of 30.  Furthermore, the `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery` hook was modified to incorporate data from this new slice, allowing for dynamic date range selection and affecting the API call parameters used to fetch data.  The final version moved the `DatePeriodSelector` component to the `PageWrapper.Right`, and an useEffect hook was introduced to set default date ranges to 30 days in the past and present if no date is selected.

The `shipment-card-info-slice.ts` file was created at 11:48:18 AM and subsequently modified a couple times to correct the default period from "30" to "30days" in the initial state.  This slice specifically manages date filters for the shipment card data.

The `types/shipment.types.ts` file was updated at 11:52:13 AM to define types related to shipment data, including `DashboardState` and `DashboardCardInfoState`.  This update reflects the changes made to manage the dashboard state.

A recurring pattern across the changes is the consistent use of Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for state management and the frequent updating of pagination states upon filter and sort changes to ensure the dashboard data is correctly refreshed.  The modifications made to `shipment-page.tsx` represent a substantial UI refinement to improve user experience and functionality.


## 2:38:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `bookingService.ts` and `common.ts` files between 10:49 AM and 2:35 PM on July 9, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is on the `bookingService.ts` file, which handles booking-related functionalities.

**bookingService.ts:**

* **10:49:22 AM - 10:57:00 AM:** This period involves numerous iterative changes to the `getAll` function within `bookingService.ts`. These changes primarily center around refining the query logic for retrieving booking data. The key modifications are within the `BookingQueryBuilder` class, which constructs and manages the database queries.  Specific changes include adjustments to how different booking statuses ("New", "Approved", "Cancelled", "Pending", "Not Approved") are handled in the `setWhereClause` method.  The initial versions used "Not_Approved" for the default case and later versions changed the default case and used  "Pending" and later to "ALL" in the default case as well as updating the logic for how to handle the "NEW" status in the switch statement of `setWhereClause` method. There were also updates to the counts of different booking statuses returned in the response.  The `countData` function also remained unchanged throughout these commits. The `getAll` function's logic for fetching and aggregating data from different tables (`agent_booking_entry`, `agent_booking_po`, `agent_booking_cargolist`, `agent_booking_container_pre`, `agent_booking_conversation`) remains consistent throughout. The way options are retrieved and formatted in the response has remained consistent as well.

* **2:20:04 PM - 2:35:15 PM:**  The final changes include adding `gmail` import from `@src/common/util/GmailSender` and a `console.log` statement to print the user object in the `saveBooking` function. No significant alterations to the core query building or data retrieval logic are observed.

**common.ts:**

* **11:00:57 AM - 11:04:32 AM:** The primary change here is refactoring the `getAgentBookingCode` function to improve readability and remove unnecessary comments. The core functionality (generating a unique agent booking code based on location and company code) remains the same.  The changes that were made here don't change anything.

* **Import Path Change (11:05:36 AM - 11:05:49 AM):** The import path for utility functions (`AppDateFormate`, `getAgentBookingCode`, `sanitizeString`) changed from `"tests/common/util"` to `"@src/utils/common"`. This suggests a move from test utilities to a more general utility location within the project.

The overall pattern in the `bookingService.ts` modifications points towards an iterative refinement of the data retrieval and filtering logic for booking entries, likely driven by bug fixes, performance improvements, or enhancement of the API's filtering capabilities.  The consistent use of parameterized queries within the `query` function enhances security and helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The `common.ts` file shows a consistent effort in organizing reusable utility functions, improving their clarity, and moving those files to the correct location which is in the `src` folder.


## 2:59:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `booking-coulmns.tsx` file, focusing on improvements to the `pono` (PO No) column's data handling.

The initial versions (2:04:08 PM and 2:04:25 PM) contained commented-out code within the `pono` column's `valueGetter`. This commented-out code suggests an attempt to parse and clean PO numbers, potentially handling different data formats (arrays, strings, etc.).  This code was removed in subsequent updates.

A significant change occurred between 2:04:25 PM and 2:05:48 PM.  The `valueGetter` was rewritten to include  `parsePostgresArray` function which specifically handles parsing PostgreSQL array strings (e.g., `{"a","b","c"}`). This suggests a shift to a more robust way of dealing with this specific data type received from the backend.  The `parseRawString` function was removed from imports. The `cleanPO` function was simplified.

The final version (2:10:52 PM) is identical to the one at 2:05:48 PM, indicating no further functional changes after the implementation of the PostgreSQL array parsing.  The code consistently uses `@mui/x-data-grid` for grid definitions, indicating the use of a Material UI data grid component.  The changes were focused solely on the `pono` column, with no other modifications made to the other columns defining booking details.
