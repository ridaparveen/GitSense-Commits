# Activity Summary for 12/29/2025

## 2:19:28 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\utils\utils.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates & Timestamps:**
All entries for `src\utils\utils.ts` between `12/28/2025, 2:04:24 PM` and `12/29/2025, 2:17:20 PM` show **no actual code changes**. The content of the file remains identical across all logged timestamps. This indicates frequent saves or logging events where no modifications were introduced to the code itself.

**Content Overview (as present in all entries):**
The `utils.ts` file is a collection of utility functions primarily focused on date manipulation and string processing for a frontend application. Key functionalities include:

*   **`appDateFormat`**: A function to format dates into either `MM/DD/YYYY` (display) or `YYYY-MM-DD` (input) format. It handles invalid date inputs gracefully.
*   **`parseRawString`**: A utility to clean a raw string by removing outer curly braces, backslashes, quotes, and newlines, then splitting it into an array of trimmed strings based on commas or spaces.
*   **`useDateFormate`**: A React hook that leverages `moment.js` and `useFetchUserPreferenceQuery` (likely from Redux Toolkit Query) to dynamically format dates based on a user's stored `date_format` preference, defaulting to `MM/DD/YYYY`.
*   **`dateFilterHandle`**: A function that takes a filter string (e.g., "all", "today", "this_week", "last_month", "custom") and calculates appropriate `fromDate` and `toDate` values using the `appDateFormat` utility.
*   **`showLessText`**: A basic string utility to truncate text to a specified maximum length and append "..." if the text exceeds that length.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the **absence of code changes** across numerous log entries for the same file. The timestamps show a flurry of activity (or logging events) over two days, but the underlying code in `utils.ts` remains stable. The content itself reveals a consistent focus on providing reusable helper functions, especially for date handling (`moment.js` dependency) and string cleaning, indicating a common utilities module in the frontend codebase.
