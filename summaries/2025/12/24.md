# Activity Summary for 12/24/2025

## 10:37:33 AM
The code changes primarily affect two files: `src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx` and `src\SelectCustomer.tsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx`**

*   **Early Changes (12/23/2025, 2:31:01 PM - 2:40:01 PM)**: A series of minor, rapid adjustments, often involving commenting out and then uncommenting styling properties (`s.wrapper`, `s.root`, `s.vehicleBox`, `s.lineWrapper`, `s.infoRow`) or icon dimensions (`width`, `height` for `TrainSVGIcon`, `TruckSVGIcon`). There were also slight `minWidth` adjustments for `iconRow` and `infoRow`, indicating layout fine-tuning or responsive design attempts.
*   **Debugging with Hardcoded Dates (12/23/2025, 2:45:11 PM - 4:36:53 PM)**: Multiple timestamps show the introduction and subsequent removal/modification of hardcoded dates (e.g., `'2025-04-29'`, `'2023-12-31'`) and temporary labels (e.g., "ETA:123", "ETA@@:") within the `formatDate` calls and `polToPodcompletedValidation` function. This suggests extensive debugging of date-related logic and display.
*   **Major Refactoring Attempt and Reversion (12/23/2025, 4:45:54 PM - 4:46:20 PM)**: A significant refactoring effort was made to simplify the `TrackingStepper` component by removing the `getTrackingDetails` helper and constructing the timeline directly within the main component. This also involved renaming internal icon variables and changing the `useEffect` dependency for progress calculation. This refactor was almost immediately reverted, indicating it was either exploratory or not ready for integration.
*   **Evolved Tracking Logic (12/23/2025, 3:39:02 PM onwards)**:
    *   The `polToPodcompletedValidation` function was completely rewritten to handle different completion criteria based on `trackingInfo.atd` (if shipment has departed) and `trackingInfo.t49_shipment_added` status.
    *   The core `getTrackingDetails` logic was extensively modified to dynamically build the tracking timeline based on `inland_rail_move` property. It now explicitly handles "no rail" (truck) and "rail move" scenarios, including details for intermediate stops like "Rail Destination" and "Consignee Location".
    *   Introduction of `path1`, `path2`, `path3` boolean flags to control progress logic and icons.
    *   Introduction of `icon_text` property in timeline items, though its usage in rendering is not fully apparent in the provided snippets.
*   **Icon Library and Dynamic Styling (12/23/2025, 6:03:01 PM - 7:47:06 PM)**:
    *   Shifted from using `@iconify/react` for `TruckSVGIcon` to `react-icons/fa6` (`FaShip`) and `react-icons/md` (`MdDirectionsRailway` for `Railway` icon), and introduced `FaAnchor` for `Terminal` icon.
    *   Implemented dynamic positioning for the vehicle icon along the progress line (`s.vehicleBox` with `left: \`calc(${item.percentage}% - 12px)\` `).
*   **`console.log` for Debugging**: Several `console.log` statements were added, particularly for `trackingInfo` and `getTravelProgress`, suggesting active debugging throughout the development.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\shipment-details-page.tsx`**

*   **Integration of `TrackingStepper` (12/23/2025, 2:37:36 PM)**: The `TrackingStepper` component (from the other file) was integrated into the `ShipmentDetailsPage`, indicating a new feature to display shipment progress.
*   **Minor Layout Adjustments (12/23/2025, 2:37:50 PM - 2:38:05 PM)**: The `TrackingStepper` component was briefly moved within the page's JSX layout, and then reverted, suggesting minor UI positioning experiments.
*   **Debugging (`console.log`)**: Multiple `console.log` statements were added to inspect `shipmentDeatils`, `isLoading`, `isFetching`, and `isSuccess` states, indicating active debugging of data fetching and component rendering.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\SelectCustomer.tsx`**

*   **Initial State and Frontend Pagination (12/23/2025, 8:37:09 PM)**: The `SelectCustomerPanel` component was initially designed to fetch all customer options once (`fetchAllCustomers`) and then perform filtering and pagination on the client-side.
*   **Transition to Backend Pagination and Search (12/23/2025, 8:49:11 PM - 8:57:59 PM)**: A significant architectural shift occurred. The component was refactored to implement server-side pagination and search.
    *   A new `fetchCustomers` function was introduced to make API calls with `pageNo` and `keyword` parameters, updating `allOptions` (now representing the current page's data) and `total` (total items from API).
    *   The `useEffect` hook now triggers `fetchCustomers(1)` when the panel opens.
    *   `handlePageChange` and `handleSearchChange` are updated to call `fetchCustomers` with the relevant page number and search keyword, indicating that search and pagination are now handled by the backend API.
*   **Code Clarity (12/24/2025, 10:32:22 AM - 10:36:12 AM)**: Minor updates to add comments clarifying the shift from frontend to backend pagination logic. No functional changes in these very late timestamps.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **12/23/2025, 3:39:02 PM**: Major rewrite of `polToPodcompletedValidation` and `getTrackingDetails` in `tracking-stepper.tsx`, introducing complex conditional logic for shipment progress.
*   **12/23/2025, 4:45:54 PM**: First attempt at a major refactor of `TrackingStepper`'s rendering logic (later reverted).
*   **12/23/2025, 6:03:01 PM - 6:07:21 PM**: Introduction of `react-icons` for some vehicle icons in `tracking-stepper.tsx`, replacing `@iconify/react` for those specific elements.
*   **12/23/2025, 6:20:04 PM**: Implementation of dynamic vehicle icon positioning along the progress line in `tracking-stepper.tsx`.
*   **12/23/2025, 8:49:11 PM**: Significant overhaul of `SelectCustomer.tsx` to switch from client-side to server-side pagination and search for customer options.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: A strong pattern of small, sequential changes, often followed by reverts (commenting/uncommenting sections, temporary hardcoded values, `console.log` statements), indicates an active, iterative development process with frequent debugging.
*   **Refactoring Efforts**: Both files show attempts at refactoring core logic (`getTrackingDetails` in `tracking-stepper.tsx` and pagination in `SelectCustomer.tsx`). While one refactor was reverted, the other (pagination) was successfully implemented, suggesting ongoing code improvement.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements**: Changes related to icon styles, layout adjustments, and dynamic icon positioning point towards continuous refinement of the user interface and experience for tracking shipments and selecting customers.
*   **Backend Integration**: The shift in `SelectCustomer.tsx` to backend-driven pagination and search signifies a move towards more scalable and efficient data handling, reducing client-side processing for large datasets.
