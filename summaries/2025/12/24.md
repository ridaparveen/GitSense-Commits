# Activity Summary for 12/24/2025

## 10:37:33 AM
The code changes primarily affect two files: `src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx` and `src\SelectCustomer.tsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx`**

*   **Early Changes (12/23/2025, 2:31:01 PM - 2:40:01 PM)**: A series of minor, rapid adjustments, often involving commenting out and then uncommenting styling properties (`s.wrapper`, `s.root`, `s.vehicleBox`, `s.lineWrapper`, `s.infoRow`) or icon dimensions (`width`, `height` for `TrainSVGIcon`, `TruckSVGIcon`). There were also slight `minWidth` adjustments for `iconRow` and `infoRow`, indicating layout fine-tuning or responsive design attempts.
*   **Debugging with Hardcoded Dates (12/23/2025, 2:45:11 PM - 4:36:53 PM)**: Multiple timestamps show the introduction and subsequent removal/modification of hardcoded dates (e.g., `'2025-04-29'`, `'2023-12-31'`) and temporary labels (e.g., "ETA:123", "ETA@@:") within the `formatDate` calls and `polToPodcompletedValidation` function. This suggests extensive debugging of date-related logic and display.
*   **Major Refactoring Attempt and Reversion (12/23/2025, 4:45:54 PM - 4:46:20 PM)**: A significant refactoring effort was made to simplify the `TrackingStepper` component by removing the `getTrackingDetails` helper and constructing the timeline directly within the main component. This also involved renaming internal icon variables and changing the `useEffect` dependency for progress calculation. This refactor was almost immediately reverted, indicating it was either exploratory or not ready for integration.
*   **Evolved Tracking Logic (12/23/2025, 3:39:02 PM onwards)**:
    *   The `polToPodcompletedValidation` function was completely rewritten to handle different completion criteria based on `trackingInfo.atd` (if shipment has departed) and `trackingInfo.t49_shipment_added` status.
    *   The core `getTrackingDetails` logic was extensively modified to dynamically build the tracking timeline based on `inland_rail_move` property. It now explicitly handles "no rail" (truck) and "rail move" scenarios, including details for intermediate stops like "Rail Destination" and "Consignee Location".
    *   Introduction of `path1`, `path2`, `path3` boolean flags to control progress logic and icons.
    *   Introduction of `icon_text` property in timeline items, though its usage in rendering is not fully apparent in the provided snippets.
*   **Icon Library and Dynamic Styling (12/23/2025, 6:03:01 PM - 7:47:06 PM)**:
    *   Shifted from using `@iconify/react` for `TruckSVGIcon` to `react-icons/fa6` (`FaShip`) and `react-icons/md` (`MdDirectionsRailway` for `Railway` icon), and introduced `FaAnchor` for `Terminal` icon.
    *   Implemented dynamic positioning for the vehicle icon along the progress line (`s.vehicleBox` with `left: \`calc(${item.percentage}% - 12px)\` `).
*   **`console.log` for Debugging**: Several `console.log` statements were added, particularly for `trackingInfo` and `getTravelProgress`, suggesting active debugging throughout the development.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\shipment-details-page.tsx`**

*   **Integration of `TrackingStepper` (12/23/2025, 2:37:36 PM)**: The `TrackingStepper` component (from the other file) was integrated into the `ShipmentDetailsPage`, indicating a new feature to display shipment progress.
*   **Minor Layout Adjustments (12/23/2025, 2:37:50 PM - 2:38:05 PM)**: The `TrackingStepper` component was briefly moved within the page's JSX layout, and then reverted, suggesting minor UI positioning experiments.
*   **Debugging (`console.log`)**: Multiple `console.log` statements were added to inspect `shipmentDeatils`, `isLoading`, `isFetching`, and `isSuccess` states, indicating active debugging of data fetching and component rendering.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\SelectCustomer.tsx`**

*   **Initial State and Frontend Pagination (12/23/2025, 8:37:09 PM)**: The `SelectCustomerPanel` component was initially designed to fetch all customer options once (`fetchAllCustomers`) and then perform filtering and pagination on the client-side.
*   **Transition to Backend Pagination and Search (12/23/2025, 8:49:11 PM - 8:57:59 PM)**: A significant architectural shift occurred. The component was refactored to implement server-side pagination and search.
    *   A new `fetchCustomers` function was introduced to make API calls with `pageNo` and `keyword` parameters, updating `allOptions` (now representing the current page's data) and `total` (total items from API).
    *   The `useEffect` hook now triggers `fetchCustomers(1)` when the panel opens.
    *   `handlePageChange` and `handleSearchChange` are updated to call `fetchCustomers` with the relevant page number and search keyword, indicating that search and pagination are now handled by the backend API.
*   **Code Clarity (12/24/2025, 10:32:22 AM - 10:36:12 AM)**: Minor updates to add comments clarifying the shift from frontend to backend pagination logic. No functional changes in these very late timestamps.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **12/23/2025, 3:39:02 PM**: Major rewrite of `polToPodcompletedValidation` and `getTrackingDetails` in `tracking-stepper.tsx`, introducing complex conditional logic for shipment progress.
*   **12/23/2025, 4:45:54 PM**: First attempt at a major refactor of `TrackingStepper`'s rendering logic (later reverted).
*   **12/23/2025, 6:03:01 PM - 6:07:21 PM**: Introduction of `react-icons` for some vehicle icons in `tracking-stepper.tsx`, replacing `@iconify/react` for those specific elements.
*   **12/23/2025, 6:20:04 PM**: Implementation of dynamic vehicle icon positioning along the progress line in `tracking-stepper.tsx`.
*   **12/23/2025, 8:49:11 PM**: Significant overhaul of `SelectCustomer.tsx` to switch from client-side to server-side pagination and search for customer options.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: A strong pattern of small, sequential changes, often followed by reverts (commenting/uncommenting sections, temporary hardcoded values, `console.log` statements), indicates an active, iterative development process with frequent debugging.
*   **Refactoring Efforts**: Both files show attempts at refactoring core logic (`getTrackingDetails` in `tracking-stepper.tsx` and pagination in `SelectCustomer.tsx`). While one refactor was reverted, the other (pagination) was successfully implemented, suggesting ongoing code improvement.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements**: Changes related to icon styles, layout adjustments, and dynamic icon positioning point towards continuous refinement of the user interface and experience for tracking shipments and selecting customers.
*   **Backend Integration**: The shift in `SelectCustomer.tsx` to backend-driven pagination and search signifies a move towards more scalable and efficient data handling, reducing client-side processing for large datasets.

## 1:49:14 PM
The `ShipmentTrackingScreen.jsx` file, last updated on **12/23/2025, 10:08:25 AM**, details a React component for displaying comprehensive shipment tracking information. This screen dynamically fetches shipment and vessel tracking data based on `mblno` and `fileno` from URL parameters. It features a layout divided into a main content area and a sidebar, utilizing Material-UI components for structuring. Key elements include a map for tracking, a `TrackingStepper` for status visualization, `CardField` components to display core shipment details (e.g., File No, BL, Supplier, MBL No), and an expandable "More Details" section to reveal additional information like Customer Ref No, Commodity, Consignee, Service, Piece count, and Weight. The screen also incorporates `TrackingInfoContainer` and `MilestonesContainer` for further details. A loading state is managed with a `Loader` component.

The `App.js` file, last updated on **12/24/2025, 10:36:54 AM**, serves as the central routing configuration for the application. It defines an extensive set of routes for various modules, including authentication, user management, dashboards, packing lists, service invoices, PO orders, OTM BOLs, customer/party/agent code management, planboards, detention, commercial invoices, ALC, container reports, report scheduling, and multiple tracking functionalities (FCL, LCL, Rail, Air, Trucking). A predominant pattern across this file is the widespread implementation of role-based access control using `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthGuard` components, alongside a `UserRoleEnum` to restrict access to specific routes based on the user's role (e.g., ADMIN, CUSTOMER, AGENT, SPR_CUSTOMER). Many features are structured with a primary view screen and a corresponding form screen for data entry or modification. The application also uses `ThemeProvider` for consistent styling and `Toaster` for notifications.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Role-based Access Control:** A strong emphasis on security is evident through the extensive use of `ProtectedRoute` and `UserRoleEnum` to manage user permissions for nearly all application routes.
*   **Modularity and Form-Based Interactions:** The application structure frequently involves dedicated screens for viewing lists of items and separate form screens for creating or editing those items across various modules.
*   **Dashboard and Tracking Focus:** Both files highlight a significant focus on displaying and managing dashboards and detailed tracking information, with specific routes for various tracking modes (shipment, FCL, LCL, Rail, Air).
*   **Material-UI (MUI) Integration:** The consistent use of `@mui/material` components in `ShipmentTrackingScreen.jsx` and the presence of `ThemeProvider` in `App.js` indicate a unified Material-UI design system.
*   **Modern Data Handling:** The use of RTK Query hooks in `ShipmentTrackingScreen.jsx` suggests a modern approach to API interaction and state management.

## 1:49:20 PM
The provided log details code changes primarily focused on enhancing the analytics and reporting capabilities of the `t360-backend-v2` project, along with expanding API routes. The changes occurred between December 18, 2025, and December 24, 2025.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\customerAutosearchOptions.ts`**
    *   **12/18/2025, 3:54:52 PM:** The `getAllCustomerOptions` function was initially implemented. It supported fetching distinct customer names (`account_name`) for the `CUSTOMER` role from `mtr_tracking_data` with optional pagination, and distinct agent names (`cname`) for the `AGENT` role from `agent_po_account_master` with a limit of 10. Results were formatted as `{ value, label }` pairs.
    *   **12/23/2025, 8:50:22 PM:** The logic for the `CUSTOMER` role was revised. The `countQuery` for pagination was changed from `COUNT(DISTINCT account_name)` to a more robust subquery `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT 1 FROM mtr_tracking_data GROUP BY account_name) t`, and the data query also incorporated `GROUP BY account_name` and `ORDER BY account_name`.
    *   **12/23/2025, 8:58:22 PM:** A major refactor of `getAllCustomerOptions` occurred. The previous implementations were commented out and a new version was introduced. This version added a `search` query parameter, enabling filtering by name (case-insensitive `ILIKE`) for both `AGENT` (`cname`) and `CUSTOMER` (`account_name`) roles. The pagination logic for `CUSTOMER` was further refined to apply the search filter to both the total count and the data retrieval.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**
    *   **12/18/2025, 3:55:32 PM:** Several new API base paths and their sub-endpoints were added to the `Paths` constant. These include:
        *   `Audit` (`/audit` with `Get`)
        *   `Planbaord` (`/planboard` with `Get`)
        *   `Company` (`/company`)
        *   `CustomerOptions` (`/getCustomerOptions`)
        *   `Menu` (`/menus` with `GetUserMenus`)
        *   `CO2Emission` (`/co2emission` with `Get`)
    This indicates a significant expansion of the application's exposed functionalities.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\index.ts`**
    *   **12/18/2025, 3:56:44 PM:** This file was updated to integrate the newly defined paths and their corresponding service functions or routers into the main `apiRouter`. Specifically, routes for `PlanbaordRoutes`, `MenuRoutes`, `Co2EmissionRoutes`, `getAllCustomerOptions`, and `getAllAudit` were added, mirroring the additions in `Paths.ts`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **12/19/2025, 7:53:25 AM:** A `getMonthValue` helper function was added to convert stacked month strings (e.g., "Jan") to numeric values. The primary change was the introduction of the `bookingQuery` function. This large function dynamically generates complex SQL queries for various "booking" related reports (e.g., "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to POD Arrival"). It uses `reportName` as a key to retrieve specific query snippets, applies `CompanyName` filters, and includes extensive conditional logic for date range filtering (by month, week, quarter) and grouping for stacked bar charts, often categorizing `day_diff` into week-based ranges. It frequently joins `mtr_tracking_data` with `agent_booking_entry` on `mblno` and filters out invalid date values.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **12/24/2025, 1:13:00 PM:** The `getExportData` function was introduced, acting as the main entry point for exporting analytics data. It processes various query parameters (e.g., `fromDate`, `toDate`, `reportName`, `columns`, `mblwise`, `booking`). It retrieves user and company information, dynamically generates SQL queries using `bookingQuery` or `nonBookingQuery` (the latter not detailed in this log but implied), and handles default date ranges. For "booking" reports, it includes logic for `mblWiseQuery` to select distinct records based on `mblno` or container details. A specific filter for "mblwise TEU" reports handles duplicate container entries. Finally, it applies `dateFilterOnExport` and `replaceColumnHandler` to the data, with `replaceColumnHandler` notably standardizing "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics and Reporting Focus:** The most prominent pattern is the extensive development within the `analytics` domain, covering data retrieval for auto-suggest, dynamic SQL generation for complex reports, and a dedicated service for exporting this data.
*   **Dynamic Query Generation:** The `export.query.ts` and `analyticsExportService.ts` files heavily rely on dynamically constructing SQL queries based on user-selected report names and filters, indicating a flexible reporting architecture.
*   **Date and Time Manipulation:** Frequent use of `EXTRACT` in SQL, explicit date range filtering, and handling of placeholder/invalid date values (`'0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'`) are common in the reporting queries.
*   **Role-Based Data Access:** The `customerAutosearchOptions.ts` file clearly segregates data fetching logic based on user roles (`AGENT` vs. `CUSTOMER`).
*   **Structured API Design:** The updates to `Paths.ts` and `index.ts` demonstrate a consistent approach to defining new API endpoints and integrating them into the backend, expanding the application's feature set.
*   **Pagination and Search:** The evolution of `customerAutosearchOptions.ts` highlights an iterative refinement process to implement robust pagination and search functionalities for data selection.
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** All service functions utilize `logger.error` and return `res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" })` for unhandled exceptions.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** All changes occurred within a short, concentrated period (December 18-24, 2025), suggesting active and rapid development on these specific features.

## 2:49:14 PM
The `ShipmentTrackingScreen.jsx` file, last modified on December 23, 2025, at 10:08:25 AM, was updated to provide a detailed view for shipment tracking. This component is responsible for fetching and displaying comprehensive shipment and vessel data, including a visual map, a tracking stepper, and organized shipment information. It leverages Material-UI components for its layout and custom components like `MapTrackingContainer`, `TrackingStepper`, `TrackingInfoContainer`, and `MilestonesContainer`. Key shipment details such as file number, BL, supplier, MBL, customer reference, commodity, consignee, service, piece count, and weight are presented, with a toggleable "More Details" section for additional information.

The `App.js` file, significantly updated on December 24, 2025, at 10:36:54 AM, primarily focuses on expanding the application's routing and implementing robust access control. This update integrated numerous new pages and functionalities, demonstrating a substantial growth in the application's feature set. New routes were added for various tracking types (FCL, LCL, Rail, Air, Trucking, and the general `ShipmentTrackingScreen`), multiple dashboards (e.g., `ISFDashboardScreen`, `Dashboard7501Screen`), booking enhancements (including HBL and ISF forms), and master data management (City, Port, Customer, Agent).

A dominant pattern observed across these changes, especially in `App.js`, is the extensive use of role-based access control. Almost all routes are protected by `ProtectedRoute` or `AuthGuard`, specifying multiple `UserRoleEnum` values (such as ADMIN, CUSTOMER, AGENT, SPR_CUSTOMER), indicating a strong emphasis on security and granular user permissions. Recurring elements include numerous `*/form` routes, suggesting a multitude of screens dedicated to data entry and editing across different modules. The "Extend" suffix in component names like `AgentBookingFormScreenExtend` and `BookingDashbaordScreenExtend` points to an iterative development approach where existing features are enhanced or replaced with more comprehensive versions. The overall content highlights the development of a large, modular application with distinct sections for booking, tracking, analytics, user management, and various administrative functions.

## 2:49:20 PM
The initial set of changes, occurring between 12/18/2025, 3:54:52 PM and 12/18/2025, 3:56:44 PM, introduced new features and endpoints:

*   **`src\services\analytics\customerAutosearchOptions.ts` (12/18/2025, 3:54:52 PM):** A new service function `getAllCustomerOptions` was added. This function dynamically fetches distinct customer or agent names (cname/account\_name) from `agent_po_account_master` or `mtr_tracking_data` tables, respectively, based on the `role` query parameter. It supports basic pagination for the `CUSTOMER` role, returning data with `value` and `label` fields.
*   **`src\common\constants\Paths.ts` (12/18/2025, 3:55:32 PM):** This file was updated to define new API paths. Notably, `CustomerOptions.Base: "/getCustomerOptions"`, `Menu.Base: "/menus"`, `CO2Emission.Base: "/co2emission"`, and `Audit.Get: "/audit"` were added.
*   **`src\routes\index.ts` (12/18/2025, 3:56:44 PM):** The main API router was updated to integrate the newly defined paths and services. It now registers routes for `MenuRoutes`, `Co2EmissionRoutes`, `getAllCustomerOptions` (for `Paths.CustomerOptions.Base`), and `getAllAudit` (for `Paths.Audit.Get`).

On **12/19/2025, 7:53:25 AM**, the file `src\common\util\export.query.ts` was updated. This change introduced a `getMonthValue` helper function and a comprehensive `bookingQuery` function. The `bookingQuery` function is responsible for generating complex, dynamic SQL queries for various analytics reports related to booking, departure, and arrival dates. It calculates date differences, applies conditional filtering based on `stackedExport`, `displayBy` (month, week, quarter), and `stackedGroup`, and handles specific report names like "Booking Date to Actual Departure" or "Booking Date to POD Arrival."

Significant updates to the `customerAutosearchOptions.ts` file occurred on **12/23/2025**:

*   **12/23/2025, 8:50:22 PM:** The pagination logic for the `CUSTOMER` role in `getAllCustomerOptions` was refactored. The `countQuery` was updated to use a subquery (`SELECT 1 FROM mtr_tracking_data GROUP BY account_name`) to more accurately count distinct `account_name` entries for pagination totals. The `sqlQuery` also incorporated `GROUP BY account_name` and `ORDER BY account_name` for fetching paginated data.
*   **12/23/2025, 8:58:22 PM:** A complete rewrite of the `getAllCustomerOptions` function introduced a crucial `search` functionality. This version added a `search` query parameter, allowing users to filter both `AGENT` and `CUSTOMER` results using an `ILIKE` clause in the SQL queries. The new implementation dynamically builds `WHERE` clauses to include this search filter in both counting and data retrieval queries, significantly enhancing the autosearch capabilities.

Further analytics-related changes occurred on **12/24/2025** in the `src\services\analytics\analyticsExportService.ts` file:

*   **12/24/2025, 1:13:00 PM:** The `getExportData` function was introduced, designed to handle the export of various analytics reports. It processes a wide range of query parameters (e.g., `fromDate`, `toDate`, `reportName`, `columns`), determines the relevant company and user context, and then utilizes `bookingQuery` or `nonBookingQuery` (from `export.query.ts`) to construct the appropriate SQL for data retrieval. It includes specific logic for handling "MBLwise TEU" reports and introduces a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for POD/delivery locations.
*   **12/24/2025, 1:58:20 PM:** A minor update to `analyticsExportService.ts` occurred, primarily involving a commented-out `console.log` statement, indicating minor debugging adjustments without changing the core logic.

Finally, on **12/24/2025, 2:14:49 PM**, a substantial change was made to `src\services\shipmentService.ts`. This involved the introduction of a new `SqlQueryBuilder` class. This builder dynamically constructs SQL queries for shipments, supporting both "ocean" and "air" transport modes. It incorporates complex filtering based on user roles (Admin, Customer, FrontOffice, Agent), general filters (POL, POD, shipment ID, container number, company name), and specific "card filters" (e.g., pending departure, in transit). The builder applies distinct conditions for ocean and air shipments, handles date ranges, and supports `ShipmentStatus` and `AirShipmentStatus` enums for status-based filtering, representing a significant architectural improvement for managing shipment data queries.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Analytics and Reporting Focus:** A recurring theme is the enhancement of analytics and reporting features, with services dedicated to customer autosearch, dynamic SQL generation for reports, and data export.
*   **Dynamic SQL Query Construction:** Multiple files (`export.query.ts`, `customerAutosearchOptions.ts`, `shipmentService.ts`) demonstrate sophisticated logic for building SQL queries programmatically, often using parameterized queries and conditional clauses based on user input and system state.
*   **Role-Based Logic:** User roles (ADMIN, CUSTOMER, AGENT, FRONTOFFICE) are consistently used to apply different business logic and data access rules across various services.
*   **Pagination and Filtering:** Pagination for large datasets and comprehensive filtering capabilities (by date, status, search terms, locations) are common requirements addressed in these updates.
*   **Data Transformation:** Results from database queries are frequently transformed or mapped into a more user-friendly format (e.g., `value`/`label` pairs, column name replacements).
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust `try...catch` blocks and detailed `logger.info`/`logger.error` statements are used throughout the codebase for monitoring and stability.

## 2:49:40 PM
The code changes primarily involve three frontend components: `tracking-stepper.tsx`, `SelectCustomer.tsx`, `usercard.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `chip-tabs-view.tsx`, `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, and `ViewContainer.tsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes occurred on **12/23/2025**, between **7:40:17 PM and 7:56:52 PM**.
    *   **Summary:** This file, responsible for displaying a shipment tracking stepper, underwent rapid iterations.
        *   Initial changes involved refining icon logic, particularly for the 'Port of Discharge' (POD) step, to dynamically display `Terminal` or `TruckSVGIcon` based on the shipment's "on the way" status and inland rail movement.
        *   Hardcoded fallback dates (e.g., `'2025-04-29'`, then `'2023-12-31'`) for `eta` (Estimated Time of Arrival) and `ata` (Actual Time of Arrival) were introduced and then adjusted or removed in different parts of the timeline generation and completion validation logic.
        *   A significant change involved an inversion of the `if (trackingInfo.inland_rail_move !== "Yes")` condition at **7:50:38 PM**, fundamentally altering how different inland movement scenarios are processed.
        *   `console.log` statements were frequently added, indicating active debugging of the tracking logic.

2.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\SelectCustomer.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes occurred on **12/23/2025** (8:37:09 PM - 8:57:59 PM) and **12/24/2025** (10:32:22 AM - 10:36:12 AM).
    *   **Summary:** This component, which allows selecting a customer, was refactored to shift from client-side data handling to server-side.
        *   Initially, all customer options were fetched at once (`fetchAllCustomers`) and then filtered/paginated locally.
        *   By **12/23/2025, 8:57:59 PM**, the `fetchCustomers` function was updated to accept `pageNo` and `keyword` parameters, enabling backend-driven pagination and search.
        *   By **12/24/2025, 10:32:22 AM**, the frontend filtering and slicing logic for pagination were commented out or removed, confirming the complete transition to relying on the backend for these operations.

3.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\core\usercard.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes occurred on **12/24/2025**, between **11:09:51 AM and 12:12:52 PM**.
    *   **Summary:** Updates to the user card component focused on logout behavior and user information display.
        *   The `handleLogout` function for Auth0 users initially redirected to a `/login` page after clearing local storage, but this was reverted to redirect to the Auth0 `/logout` endpoint directly by **12:24/2025, 12:12:52 PM**.
        *   The display of the user's company name went through several adjustments, moving from `data?.company_name` (from `useFetchUserPreferenceQuery`) to `user?.companyname` (from local storage) and saw formatting changes, including separating the role and company name into different lines and adding a `title` attribute for a tooltip.

4.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\core\sidebar.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes occurred on **12/24/2025**, between **11:13:54 AM and 11:25:19 AM**.
    *   **Summary:** This sidebar component underwent numerous minor cosmetic and debugging-related changes.
        *   The logo text changed several times (e.g., "36000", "360kk", "360@@", "@@@@@@@@") and was repeatedly corrected, indicating active debugging of the UI.
        *   Spacing and layout around the logo and user's company name were frequently adjusted using Tailwind CSS classes (`gap`, `ml`, `mr`).
        *   The user's company name was added to the main logo display and its source (`localUser?.companyname`) was refined.
        *   Skeleton loaders for loading states and error handling were present in the initial log and remained consistent.

5.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes occurred on **12/24/2025**, between **12:23:18 PM and 12:31:33 PM**.
    *   **Summary:** This chip-tabs component experienced a series of styling and structural changes, often followed by reverts.
        *   Temporary strings like "kk" were added to the `label` prop for debugging purposes.
        *   Styling for the tab buttons (e.g., conditional background, borders, text colors, dimensions) was frequently removed and then restored, indicating UI experimentation.
        *   There was an attempt to implement absolute positioning for scroll navigation buttons and internal padding for the scroll container, which was fully reverted by **12:31:33 PM**.
        *   A temporary change in the `onChange` prop's type signature was made and then reverted.

6.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes occurred on **12/24/2025**, between **12:32:03 PM and 12:40:29 PM**.
    *   **Summary:** This analytics toolbar component saw rapid, granular adjustments to its layout and minor functional tweaks.
        *   Extensive fine-tuning of Tailwind CSS spacing classes (`gap`, `space-x`, `mt`, `mb`) for elements like the filter dropdown and export button. These were often incremental, with some values being adjusted multiple times (e.g., `mt-2` to `mt-3` to no `mt`, then back to `mt-2` for the "Filter" label).
        *   A temporary change in the `value` of the "New" button in the `ChipsTabView` from "New" to "New1" and back was noted, likely for testing.
        *   The component consistently includes functionality for PDF export of the dashboard using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`, including adding a logo.

7.  **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes occurred on **12/24/2025**, between **12:45:24 PM and 12:59:45 PM**.
    *   **Summary:** This component manages the creation and editing of custom analytics dashboard views.
        *   The initialization logic for `checkBoxManager` (which tracks selected metrics) and `numChecked` (count of selected metrics) was refactored into a dedicated `initializeCheckedMetrics` function for clarity and reusability at **12:48:26 PM**.
        *   A new `useEffect` hook was added at **12:57:04 PM** to ensure that when creating a new view, the state is correctly reset, preventing data from previous edits from persisting.
        *   `console.log` statements were added to debug `viewTitle`, `action`, and `viewOptions`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Rapid Iteration and Debugging**: A prevalent pattern across all files, especially `tracking-stepper.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `chip-tabs-view.tsx`, `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, and `ViewContainer.tsx`, is the frequent saving of minor changes, often involving temporary debugging `console.log` statements or placeholder strings ("kk", "@@@@@@@@"). This suggests an active development phase with continuous testing and UI adjustments.
*   **UI Layout and Styling Adjustments**: Many changes involve tweaking Tailwind CSS classes for spacing, alignment, and appearance. This indicates an ongoing effort to refine the user interface's aesthetics and responsiveness.
*   **Refactoring for Data Management**: `SelectCustomer.tsx` shows a clear architectural shift from client-side to server-side pagination and search, improving scalability and performance for data-heavy components. `ViewContainer.tsx` also refactored state initialization for better maintainability.
*   **Conditional Rendering/Logic**: Components frequently use conditional rendering based on user roles (e.g., "ADMIN_V2" in `sidebar.tsx`, `user.role` in `ViewContainer.tsx`) or data presence (e.g., `trackingInfo.inland_rail_move` in `tracking-stepper.tsx`), indicating a focus on dynamic behavior and access control.
*   **Date and Time Handling**: The `tracking-stepper.tsx` component shows consistent effort in precisely handling and displaying Estimated/Actual Dates (ETA/ATA) and implementing validation logic around them, including fallback values.
*   **Dependency on Local Storage**: `usercard.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, and `ViewContainer.tsx` consistently interact with `localStorage` to retrieve user information (e.g., `user`, `authtype`) for display or API calls, which is a recurring pattern for user session management.

## 3:49:12 PM
The code changes log details updates across two key frontend files, indicating active development in a React application using Material-UI, React Router, and Redux Toolkit Query for data management.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\dashboard\ShipmentTrackingScreen.jsx`**
**Timestamp: 12/23/2025, 10:08:25 AM**
This file, `ShipmentTrackingScreen.jsx`, details the implementation of a comprehensive shipment tracking page. Key updates and features include:
*   **Technology Stack:** Heavy utilization of Material-UI (MUI) components for layout (Box, Stack, Card, Typography) and interactive elements (IconButton, ExpandMoreIcon/LessIcon).
*   **Data Fetching:** Integration with Redux Toolkit Query, specifically `useFetchShipmentTrackingQuery`, to retrieve shipment data based on `mblno` and `fileno` parameters from the URL.
*   **UI Components:** Incorporates various custom components like `ScreenToolbar`, `MapTrackingContainer` (for displaying vessel/shipment location), `TrackingStepper` (to visualize shipment progress), `TrackingInfoContainer`, `MilestonesContainer`, and `CardField` for structured data display.
*   **Interactive Details:** A "More Details" section allows users to expand/collapse additional shipment information, such as `Customer Ref No.`, `Notify`, `Commodity`, `Consignee`, `Service`, `Piece count`, and `Weight`.
*   **Loading State:** Displays a `Loader` component during data fetching, enhancing user experience.
*   **Navigation:** Uses `useNavigate` for a `goBack` function.
This file outlines a feature-rich screen focused on presenting detailed and interactive shipment tracking information.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\App.js`**
**Timestamp: 12/24/2025, 10:36:54 AM**
The `App.js` file, central to the application's routing, shows extensive additions and modifications, reflecting significant growth and expansion of the application's features.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Confirms integration with Auth0 via `Auth0Login`, `HandleAuthCallback`, and `Auth0LogoutHandler`.
    *   Employs `AuthGuard` for public/authentication-related routes and `ProtectedRoute` for application routes.
    *   A strong pattern of **role-based access control** is evident, with `allowedRoles` (e.g., `UserRoleEnum.ADMIN`, `UserRoleEnum.CUSTOMER`, `UserRoleEnum.AGENT`, `UserRoleEnum.SPR_CUSTOMER`) applied to almost every protected route, showcasing a granular security model.
*   **Route Expansion:**
    *   The file imports and defines routes for a vast number of new pages and modules. This includes, but is not limited to:
        *   **Dashboard & Tracking:** `ShipmentTrackingScreen`, `BookingDashbaordScreenExtend`, `ISFDashboardScreen`, `AnalyticsScreen`, and various dedicated tracking screens (`FCLScreen`, `LCLScreen`, `AddMtrForm`, `GetTruckingDetails`, `RailScreen`, `AirTrackingScreen`).
        *   **Administrative & Master Data:** `UserManagementScreen`, `NewRegisteredUserScreen`, `ExpenseCodeScreen`, `DestinationScreen`, `VendorScreen`, `PortmasterScreen`, `CityMaster`, `CustomerScreen`, `PartyScreen`, `AgentScreen`, `SettingsScreen`.
        *   **Operational Modules:** `PackingListScreen`, `ServiceInvoiceScreen`, `PoOrderScreen`, `DsoOrderScreen`, `OtmBolScreen` (including `UploadOTMBOL`, `AddOtmBolScreen`, `EditOtmBolScreen`), `BookingPlanBoardScreen`, `SPRPlanBoardScreen`, `LineWiseScreen`, `CustomerWiseScreen`, `CIScreen`, `AgentPoScreen`, `CngInvoiceScreen`, `AlcScreen`, `ShippingOrdersScreen`, `ContainerReportScreen`, `ReportSchedulerScreen`.
        *   **Extended Functionality:** Several components now use an "Extend" suffix (e.g., `AgentBookingFormScreenExtend`, `BookingDashbaordScreenExtend`, `AgentPoFormExtend`), suggesting upgrades or more comprehensive versions of existing features.
*   **Development Artifacts:** A `console.log("🚀 ~ file: App.js:2 ~ TEST on Flow");` is present, likely a temporary debugging statement.
This update signifies a major feature development phase, dramatically increasing the application's scope and complexity, with a robust authorization system in place.

## 3:49:26 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing analytics, reporting, and shipment tracking functionalities within the backend system. Key updates include the introduction of new API endpoints, extensive refactoring of data retrieval services, and detailed SQL query adjustments for improved performance and new features.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\customerAutosearchOptions.ts`**
    *   **12/18/2025, 3:54:52 PM:** Initial implementation of `getAllCustomerOptions` function. This service allows fetching distinct customer or agent names (`cname` from `agent_po_account_master` for AGENTs and `account_name` from `mtr_tracking_data` for CUSTOMERs) for autosearch, supporting basic pagination for customers.
    *   **12/23/2025, 8:50:22 PM:** The logic for `CUSTOMER` role with pagination was significantly refined. The `COUNT(DISTINCT account_name)` query for total count was replaced with a subquery approach (`COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT 1 FROM ... GROUP BY account_name)`) and the data retrieval query was updated to explicitly `GROUP BY account_name ORDER BY account_name` with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`. The previous customer pagination logic was commented out.
    *   **12/23/2025, 8:58:22 PM:** A major refactor. The entire previous version of `getAllCustomerOptions` (including the 12/23 8:50 PM update) was commented out and a new implementation was introduced. This new version adds a `search` query parameter, enabling dynamic filtering of agent `cname` or customer `account_name` using `ILIKE` for partial matches. It also integrates this search capability into both paginated and non-paginated customer queries.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**
    *   **12/18/2025, 3:55:32 PM:** New API paths were added to the `Paths` constant. Specifically, `CustomerOptions: { Base: "/getCustomerOptions", }`, `Menu: { Base: "/menus", GetUserMenus: "/getusermenus" }`, and `CO2Emission: { Base: "/co2emission", Get: "/get", }` were introduced, indicating new features or modules.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\index.ts`**
    *   **12/18/2025, 3:56:44 PM:** This file, which sets up the main API routes, was updated to integrate the newly defined endpoints. It now uses `apiRouter.use(Paths.CustomerOptions.Base, getAllCustomerOptions);` to expose the customer autosearch functionality. Additionally, `MenuRoutes` and `Co2EmissionRoutes` were imported and linked to their respective base paths.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **12/19/2025, 7:53:25 AM:** The `bookingQuery` function, responsible for generating complex SQL queries for analytics reports, was expanded. It now includes detailed query fragments for a new report type: "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)". This involves extensive conditional logic based on `stackedExport`, `displayBy` (month, week, quarter), and `stackedGroup` parameters, alongside checks for valid date values and `mblno`. A `getMonthValue` helper was also added.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **12/24/2025, 1:13:00 PM:** The `getExportData` function, which handles the export of analytics data, was updated. It now retrieves report-specific SQL queries using `bookingQuery` or `nonBookingQuery`, handles default date ranges, and dynamically constructs the main SQL query based on user roles and report parameters (e.g., `mblwise`, `CompanyName`, `filterBy`). It also includes logic for saving column preferences and a `replaceColumnHandler` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" in `pod` and `place_of_delivery` fields, and specific handling for "MBLwise TEU" reports to filter out duplicate container entries.
    *   **12/24/2025, 1:58:20 PM:** A very minor update from the previous version of this file, primarily involving commenting out a `console.log` statement for `excelExportData.rows` within the non-booking report logic. The core functionality remained unchanged.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\shipmentService.ts`**
    *   **12/24/2025, 2:14:49 PM:** This file underwent a significant overhaul with the `SqlQueryBuilder` class. It now explicitly supports dual modes for shipment tracking: 'ocean' and 'air', with an `AirShipmentStatus` enum introduced. The builder's constructor and methods (`buildUserCondition`, `buildFilterConditions`, `buildStatusCondition`) were refactored to apply conditions separately based on the transport mode. This change enables distinct user permissions, filtering options (POL, POD, shipment ID, container number, company name), and status management for both ocean (`mtr_tracking_data`) and air shipments, including card-based filters for ocean shipments.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\.dbclient\storage\1747201553765@@127.0.0.1@5432@Rida_Database@public\public.sql`**
    *   **12/24/2025, 3:45:22 PM:** This log entry contains a collection of PostgreSQL commands, indicating database schema and data manipulation activities. It includes:
        *   Numerous `SELECT * FROM` queries for various application tables (e.g., `role_master`, `agent_booking_entry`, `mtr_tracking_data`, `hbl_master`), likely for inspection or debugging.
        *   Schema modifications: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS role_master;`, `ALTER TABLE agent_booking_entry ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE (serial_id);`, `ALTER TABLE mtr_user_registration ADD COLUMN approval_email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;`.
        *   Data cleanup: `DELETE FROM agent_booking_entry ... WHERE a.ctid < b.ctid AND a.serial_id = b.serial_id;` for duplicate entries.
        *   New table creation: `CREATE TABLE hbl_master (...)` with a detailed schema.
        *   Extensive `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... FOREIGN KEY` statements establishing relationships between `hbl_master` and tables like `agent_booking_po`, `agent_booking_container`, `agent_booking_routing`, and `agent_booking_vessel`.
        *   Complex `SELECT` queries involving multiple `LEFT JOIN` operations (`mtr_tracking_data`, `agent_booking_entry`, `t49_tracking_details`, `po_details`) for retrieving shipment details based on completion status and account name.
        *   Example `INSERT` statements for `mtr_tracking_data`.
        *   A detailed `TotalSpendPerMonth` analytics query using `WITH` clauses and `UNION ALL` to combine SPR and CNG invoice data, categorized by quarter, demonstrating financial reporting capabilities.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Database-Centric Development:** A strong emphasis on database interaction is evident across all `.ts` files, with frequent use of a generic `query` utility for executing SQL. The `public.sql` log further highlights extensive database schema evolution and complex data retrieval logic.
*   **Role-Based Access Control and Logic:** The system consistently implements logic based on `req.query.role` or `req.user.role.toUpperCase()`, segmenting data access and functionality for `AGENT`, `CUSTOMER`, `ADMIN`, `FRONTOFFICE`, and other user types.
*   **Analytics and Reporting Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around enhancing analytics capabilities, particularly in fetching data for various reports and auto-suggest functionalities. This includes dynamic query generation based on report names and user-defined filters.
*   **Iterative Refinement of Query Logic:** The `customerAutosearchOptions.ts` file shows multiple iterations of refactoring, demonstrating an ongoing process to optimize and expand data retrieval logic, especially for pagination and search. Similarly, `shipmentService.ts` was refactored for a more robust dual-mode (ocean/air) query builder.
*   **Date and Time Manipulation in SQL:** SQL queries frequently use functions like `EXTRACT`, `DATE_PART`, `generate_series`, `BETWEEN`, and `INTERVAL` for date filtering, range generation, and calculations (e.g., `day_diff`), indicating a focus on time-series data analysis.
*   **Modularity and API Expansion:** The updates to `Paths.ts` and `index.ts` reflect the addition of new features and modules (Customer Options, Menu, CO2 Emission), suggesting a growing and modular backend architecture.

## 3:50:14 PM
The code change log details development across several frontend components, primarily focusing on shipment tracking, customer selection, sidebar navigation, and analytics dashboard tools.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Focus (12/23/2025, 7:47:06 PM - 7:56:52 PM):** The `TrackingStepper` component, responsible for visualizing shipment progress, received initial development and minor adjustments. This included setting up date formatting helpers (`formatDate`), icon components (`LocationPinIcon`, `ShipIcon`), and core logic for determining final ETA/ATA (`getFinalInlandDates`) and step completion (`polToPodcompletedValidation`). A notable change involved reversing the conditional logic for handling rail moves in `getTrackingDetails` and introducing fallback dates (`'2023-12-31'`) for missing ETA/ATA values in subtitles.
    *   **Major Refactoring & Reversion (12/24/2025, 2:04:41 PM - 3:48:41 PM):** A significant refactoring of `getTrackingDetails` occurred at 2:04:41 PM, simplifying the timeline generation by using a `switch` statement for `shipment_scope` and clearly defining POL, POD, and a simplified "Final Leg" structure. However, this major simplification was largely reverted by 2:54:51 PM, returning to the previous, more complex conditional logic involving `path1`, `path2`, `path3` flags, and conditional `inland_rail_move` checks. Subsequent minor changes involved refining the `shipment_scope` values (e.g., `PORT_RAIL` vs. `P-RAIL`) and adjusting ETA/ATA fallbacks within the reverted logic. This suggests an iterative process where a major architectural change was introduced but then rolled back, possibly due to unforeseen issues or a re-evaluation of the approach.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\SelectCustomer.tsx`**
    *   **Transition to Backend Pagination/Search (12/23/2025, 8:37:09 PM - 12/24/2025, 10:36:12 AM):** The `SelectCustomerPanel` component initially fetched all customer options and handled filtering and pagination client-side. A significant functional change was introduced at 8:49:11 PM, shifting to **backend pagination** by modifying `fetchCustomers` to retrieve data page-by-page and storing the total count. This was quickly followed by implementing **backend search** at 8:56:55 PM, passing the search keyword to the API. Subsequent changes primarily involved clarifying this architectural shift with comments and minor code adjustments.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\core\usercard.tsx`**
    *   **User Info & Logout Refinements (12/24/2025, 11:09:51 AM - 12:12:52 PM):** The `UserCard` component, displaying user details and offering logout, saw several minor refactorings. This included correcting the source of the displayed company name (moving from `data?.company_name` to `user?.companyname` from `localStorage`), temporarily introducing and then fixing a UI bug that duplicated the company name, and adding a `title` attribute for hover text. A specific functional change involved correcting the Auth0 logout redirect URL from `/login` back to `/logout`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\core\sidebar.tsx`**
    *   **Branding & Company Info (12/24/2025, 11:13:54 AM - 11:25:19 AM):** The `SideBar` component, managing application navigation, underwent cosmetic adjustments related to branding and user company display. Initial changes corrected the application title from "36000" to "360". A notable addition at 11:15:35 AM was displaying the user's company name next to the logo, drawing it from `localStorage`. A series of rapid, granular cosmetic tweaks (adjusting margins like `ml-`, `gap-`) were applied to fine-tune the spacing and alignment of this new company name display, including temporary typos that were quickly corrected. This component also conditionally renders a `SelectCustomerPanel` for "ADMIN_V2" roles.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`**
    *   **UI Layout Iteration (12/24/2025, 12:23:18 PM - 12:31:33 PM):** This component for displaying scrollable chip-style tabs saw repetitive attempts to implement "floating" left/right scroll buttons using absolute positioning and specific styling (e.g., `absolute`, `z-20`, `bg-white shadow rounded-full`), followed by immediate reversions. This pattern suggests an ongoing trial-and-error process for achieving a desired UI layout. Minor corrections to a floating label typo and `onChange` prop type definitions also occurred during this period.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**
    *   **Extensive Cosmetic Tuning (12/24/2025, 12:32:03 PM - 12:40:29 PM):** The `AnalyticsToolbar` component, which provides controls for the analytics dashboard (date filters, view management, PDF export), was subjected to a high volume of very minor, iterative cosmetic changes. These changes primarily involved adjusting Tailwind CSS spacing and margin utilities (e.g., `mr-`, `mt-`, `space-x-`, `gap-`) for its various input fields and buttons. A temporary change and rollback for the `value` of the "New" button in `ChipsTabView` also occurred, possibly for testing.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**
    *   **Custom View Management Logic (12/24/2025, 12:45:24 PM - 12:59:45 PM):** The `ViewContainer` component manages the creation, editing, and deletion of custom analytics views. Key functional enhancements were added: at 12:48:26 PM, the `initializeCheckedMetrics` function was introduced to correctly populate the checkbox state when editing an existing view, ensuring continuity. Later, at 12:57:04 PM, a `useEffect` was added to reset the form states (checkboxes, view name) when creating a new view, ensuring a clean slate. Debugging `console.log` statements were also added.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI Refinement:** A strong recurring pattern is the iterative fine-tuning of UI layout and styling, particularly visible in `sidebar.tsx`, `chip-tabs-view.tsx`, and `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` through numerous small adjustments to CSS classes (margins, padding, gaps).
*   **Refactoring & Iteration Cycles:** The log demonstrates cycles of major refactoring attempts followed by reversions (e.g., `tracking-stepper.tsx`), indicating an exploratory development process where changes are introduced, evaluated, and sometimes rolled back.
*   **State Management with Redux:** `useDispatch` and `useSelector` are consistently used across multiple components for global state management, highlighting a Redux-based architecture.
*   **API Interaction:** Components frequently interact with `ApiManager` for data fetching and saving, often including `apiKey`, `userid`, `companyname`, and `access` parameters in queries.
*   **Debugging:** The presence of `console.log` statements in various files suggests active debugging during these development phases.
*   **Date-related Logic:** Date formatting and validation (e.g., `appDateFormat`, `formatDate`, `polToPodcompletedValidation`) are critical and frequently adjusted in `tracking-stepper.tsx`.
*   **User Interface Components:** Consistent use of custom components like `RadioNav`, `SelectBox`, `ChipsTabView`, `InputBox`, and `Button`, along with Material-UI and React-icons for richer UI.
