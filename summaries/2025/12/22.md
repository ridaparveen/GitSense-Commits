# Activity Summary for 12/22/2025

## 9:39:38 AM
The `src/services/Endpoints.ts` file was updated on 12/18/2025, 3:57:49 PM, to include new API endpoints. Key additions are `ANALYTICS_EXPORT` which supports a wide range of query parameters for analytics data export, and `CUSTOMER_OPTION` for fetching customer details. The `USER_SETTINGS` endpoint was commented out.

Correspondingly, `src/services/ApiManager.ts` was modified on 12/18/2025, 3:58:46 PM, to add static methods for `analyticsExport` and `getCustomerOptions`, aligning with the new endpoints. The `getDateFormat` method was also commented out.

The `src/SelectCustomer.tsx` component underwent several significant changes:
*   **12/18/2025, 3:59:25 PM:** An initial version of a `SelectCustomerPanel` was introduced. This React component provided a customer selection UI with search and pagination capabilities, using `ApiManager.getCustomerOptions` for data retrieval and `lodash.debounce` for backend search optimization. It integrated with Redux to dispatch `setSelectedCustomer`.
*   **12/18/2025, 3:59:56 PM:** A minor debugging change was made, adding a `console.log` statement to inspect the customer options response.
*   **12/18/2025, 4:05:50 PM:** The data fetching strategy for `src/SelectCustomer.tsx` was refactored. The `fetchOptions` function no longer handled search queries, instead focusing on paginated retrieval. Search functionality was moved to client-side filtering of the fetched options, and `debounce` was removed from `fetchOptions`.
*   **12/18/2025, 4:11:15 PM:** A major architectural change to `src/SelectCustomer.tsx` was implemented. A new `fetchAllCustomers` function was introduced to fetch *all* customer options from the API in a paginated loop when the panel first opens. Subsequent search and pagination operations became entirely client-side, processing the `allOptions` array. The `CustomerOption` value type was explicitly set to `string`.
*   **12/19/2025, 7:59:44 AM:** A minor code cleanup in `src/SelectCustomer.tsx` saw the `fetchAllCustomers` function changed from a `useCallback` memoized function to a regular `async` function, without altering its core logic.

A new component, `src/components/screen/analytics/SelectCustomerPanel.tsx`, was introduced on 12/18/2025, 4:01:26 PM. This separate customer selection panel, intended for an analytics screen, used Material-UI components (Popover, TextField, List, Pagination) for its interface. It also leveraged `ApiManager.getCustomerOptions` with a debounced backend search and pagination, and dispatched selected customer data to an `analytics-slice` in Redux. This file remained unchanged in a subsequent log entry on 12/19/2025, 8:00:08 AM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **API Standardization:** Consistent use of `ApiManager` and `Endpoints` across the frontend for accessing backend services.
*   **Customer Selection Feature Duplication & Refinement:** Two distinct UI implementations for customer selection (`src/SelectCustomer.tsx` and `src/components/screen/analytics/SelectCustomerPanel.tsx`) indicate a common requirement, but with different UI frameworks (custom/Tailwind vs. Material-UI).
*   **Evolution of Search/Pagination Logic:** The `src/SelectCustomer.tsx` component specifically demonstrates a progression from server-side debounced search/pagination to a more efficient client-side search/pagination after an initial bulk fetch of all data. This pattern suggests an emphasis on improving user experience by reducing API calls for frequent search interactions.
*   **Redux for State Management:** Both customer selection components integrate with Redux, highlighting a centralized state management approach for application data.
*   **Development Pace:** The concentration of changes on 12/18/2025 suggests a focused development effort, with a minor follow-up the next day.
