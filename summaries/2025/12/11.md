# Activity Summary for 12/11/2025

## 2:18:32 PM
The provided log details changes across several controller files within a `t360-backend` project, all occurring on **12/11/2025**. The changes primarily focus on data retrieval, manipulation, and auditing related to customer, booking, DSO order, and ISF (Importer Security Filing) functionalities.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\code.controller.ts` (12/11/2025, 10:21:51 AM)**
    *   This file, despite its name "code.controller.ts", appears to handle customer-related operations.
    *   **`getAllCustomer` function:** Implements comprehensive customer data retrieval with pagination, sorting (`orderBy`), and dynamic search capabilities based on query parameters. It fetches primary customer data (`PO_AccountMaster_Customer_Master`), related shipper mappings (`account_master_shipper_MAP`), customer document uploads (`document_upload_details`), and customer-to-customer mappings (`Account_Master_Customer_MAP`).
    *   **`createCustomer` function:** Handles creation and modification of customer records.
        *   It uses `fileUpload` utility.
        *   Sanitizes `cname` by replacing multiple spaces and single quotes.
        *   Initiates a database transaction (`BEGIN`).
        *   Checks for existing customers by `acode` to determine if it's an `UPDATE` or `NEW` operation. If updating, it deletes existing related records before re-inserting.
        *   Generates a new `acode` using `getAccountCode` if it's a new customer.
        *   Inserts or updates data into `PO_AccountMaster_Customer_Master`.
        *   Handles customer types (specifically 'CUSTOMER' type) by generating a `subcode` and inserting into `agent_po_account_master_type`.
        *   Processes `mapping` data (likely shipper mappings), retrieving `polcode`, `shippercode`, and `agentcode` from other master tables (`portmaster`, `agent_po_account_master`) and inserting into `Account_Master_Shipper_MAP`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\booking.controller.ts` (12/11/2025, 10:48:24 AM and 11:05:25 AM)**
    *   These two entries show identical code, suggesting a re-save or minor, non-substantive change.
    *   Focuses on robust auditing for booking-related operations.
    *   **`auditDoUpdates` function:** Audits updates to Delivery Order (DO) related fields (`do_number`, `do_date`, `bookingdate`, `bookingno`) within the `agent_booking_entry` table, only logging changes when values differ from old data. Sets `booking_status` to `CONFIRMED` on update.
    *   **`auditBookingChanges` function:** A comprehensive audit function for various booking-related tables:
        *   `agent_booking_entry` (main booking details).
        *   `agent_booking_linked_po`: Tracks additions and removals of linked POs, logging detailed summaries for each.
        *   `agent_booking_vessel`: Tracks additions and removals of vessel information, including details like vessel, voyage, line, ETD, ETA, and CY Cutoff.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\dso_order.controller.ts` (12/11/2025, 11:08:54 AM, 11:11:03 AM, and 11:12:08 AM)**
    *   These three entries also show identical code, indicating minor or non-substantive changes, or re-saves.
    *   **`getAll` function:** Retrieves DSO (Direct Ship Order) records with pagination, sorting, date range filtering, and dynamic search.
        *   Supports searching by `supplier` name, translating it to `party_id`.
        *   Includes an `isExport` flag to fetch all data without pagination.
        *   Fetches and formats `fob_point` options, including country names.
        *   Enriches `supplier` data by looking up the supplier name from `spr_vendor_master`.
        *   Constructs a complex SQL query that joins `dso_order` with `dso_order_details` and `spr_destination_master`, aggregating order details into a JSON object.
    *   **`columnSearch` function:** A helper to build `WHERE` clauses for search conditions, handling `serial_id` for single or multiple values and other fields with `ilike` for partial matches.
    *   **`getSqlQuery` function:** Generates the main SQL query for fetching DSO orders, including joins and aggregated `orderDetails`.
    *   **`countTotalRecordQuery` function:** Generates a SQL query to count total records based on search criteria.
    *   **`getAllForBooking` function:** A similar function to `getAll` but tailored for booking context, potentially to fetch specific DSO orders linked to a booking via `serial_id`. The code provided is incomplete for this function.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\isf_v2.controller.ts` (12/11/2025, 12:09:38 PM, 12:21:59 PM, and 1:39:49 PM)**
    *   These three entries show minor differences, mainly in commented-out lines and the `generateUniqId` call, indicating iterative development.
    *   **`fields` array:** A comprehensive list of fields for `isf_master` table, covering various party details (shipper, shipto, notify, consolidator, importer, broker, buyer, seller, manufacturer), location details, and shipment information.
    *   **`fetchEdiPayload` function:** Retrieves ISF (Importer Security Filing) master data and associated commodity list (`isf_commodity_list`) based on `isf_ref_number`.
    *   **`createEdit` function:** Handles creation or updating of ISF records.
        *   Determines `EntryMode` (UPDATE/ADD) based on `isf_ref_number` presence.
        *   Sets `locationByRole` based on the user's role.
        *   Starts a database transaction.
        *   **For UPDATE:** Performs an audit using `insertAudit`, checks `cng_xml_batchlog` for previous XML creation status, updates `isf_master` with `payload`, `location`, `status`, `updated_by`, and `updated_at`, then deletes existing `isf_commodity_list` entries for re-insertion.
        *   **For ADD:** (Changes between timestamps: The line `isf_ref_number = await generateUniqId(...)` was present in earlier versions but commented out or removed in the 1:39:49 PM entry, suggesting the `isf_ref_number` might be generated differently or assumed to be provided in `payload` even for new entries, though the `EntryMode.ADD` logic seems to imply it would be generated). Inserts into `isf_master` and performs a `simpleAudit`.
        *   Inserts or re-inserts `htsList` (commodity list) into `isf_commodity_list`.
        *   Commits or rolls back the transaction.
    *   **`changeIsfStatus` function:** Updates the `status` and `reject_reason` for an ISF record.
    *   **`createDescXml` function:** Generates an ISF XML document using `isfXmlGenerator`. Checks if an XML was already sent or created.
    *   **`uploadDescXml` function:** Uploads the generated ISF XML document using `isfDescXmlUpload`. Checks if an XML was already sent.
    *   **`getAllIsfDashboard` function:** Initiates a dashboard data retrieval, but the provided code snippet is incomplete.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\booking.query.ts` (12/11/2025, 2:11:05 PM and 2:12:46 PM)**
    *   These two entries are identical, suggesting a re-save or no functional change.
    *   Defines `QueryBuilderI` interface for analytics query parameters.
    *   **`bookingQueryBuilder` function:** Constructs complex SQL queries for various booking-related analytics reports.
    *   **Common elements:**
        *   Retrieves `selectedColumns` based on category and user/report name.
        *   Sets `customizer` properties like `dateRange`, `calType`, `dateColumns`, `booking`, `mblwise`, and `calColumnConfig`.
        *   Uses `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` for dynamic filtering.
    *   **Specific report types implemented:**
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDeparture`: Calculates average days between booking date and actual departure per file/container.
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWise`: Similar to above, but per file/MBL.
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDepartureStackedBar`: Generates data for a stacked bar chart, categorizing the `day_diff` into 'Less than 1 week', '1 - 2 weeks', etc., grouped by a `dateTrunc` value.
        *   `BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWiseStackedBar`: Same as above, but MBL-wise.
    *   All these queries involve complex `SELECT DISTINCT ON`, `JOIN` between `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry`, `WHERE` clauses for date ranges and company name, and date extraction (`EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...)`) for calculating differences.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\others.controller.ts` (12/11/2025, 2:13:29 PM)**
    *   **`getTableDataReports` function:** Main entry point for various analytics reports.
    *   Handles `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`, `viewBy`, `type`, and `displayBy` from query parameters, setting default date ranges if not provided.
    *   Determines `CompanyName` and `user_id` from the authenticated user and query.
    *   Uses a large `if-else if` block to dispatch to different query builders (`chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `containerQueryBuilder`, `departureQueryBuilder`, `generalQueryBuilder`) based on the `type` parameter.
    *   Logs the generated SQL query before executing it.
    *   Returns `analysticsData` and `customizer` to the client.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Date-based Filtering and Formatting:** Many controllers (DSO, Analytics) utilize `fromDate` and `toDate` for filtering data, often converting strings to `MM/DD/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD` for database interaction. The `AppDateFormate` utility is common in `booking.controller.ts`.
2.  **Pagination and Sorting:** `page`, `perPage`, and `orderBy` are recurring query parameters for data retrieval across `code.controller.ts` and `dso_order.controller.ts`, indicating a standardized approach to listing data.
3.  **Dynamic Search/Filtering:** Functions like `columnSearch` (in `dso_order.controller.ts`) and iterating through `req.query` (`code.controller.ts`, `dso_order.controller.ts`) to build `WHERE` clauses based on column names are common for flexible data searching.
4.  **Database Transactions:** `await query('BEGIN')`, `await query('COMMIT')`, and `await query('ROLLBACK')` are used consistently in `createCustomer` (code.controller.ts) and `createEdit` (isf_v2.controller.ts) to ensure data integrity during multi-step operations.
5.  **Auditing:** The `AuditModule` (specifically `insertAudit` and `simpleAudit`) is heavily used in `booking.controller.ts` and `isf_v2.controller.ts` to log changes, additions, and removals for traceability.
6.  **`AuthenticatedRequest`:** All controllers use `AuthenticatedRequest`, implying a common authentication middleware is in place, and user information (`req.user.userid`, `req.user.role`, `req.user.location`, `req.user.companyname`) is readily available.
7.  **Error Handling:** `try-catch` blocks are consistently used, often throwing `HttpError` for specific issues and logging errors, then returning a 500 status on internal server errors.
8.  **Helper/Utility Functions:** Several utility functions (`chkStr`, `getAccountCode`, `getAccountSubCode`, `removeLastWord`, `generateUniqId`, `AppDateFormate`, `getColumnsByCategory`, `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue`) are imported and used across different files, promoting code reusability.
9.  **Data Enrichment:** Controllers often fetch basic data and then perform additional queries to enrich it (e.g., getting shipper/agent names in `code.controller.ts`, supplier names in `dso_order.controller.ts`, HTS list in `isf_v2.controller.ts`).
10. **XML Generation and Upload:** `isf_v2.controller.ts` specifically uses `isfXmlGenerator` and `isfDescXmlUpload` for generating and uploading XML documents related to ISF filings, checking batch logs (`cng_xml_batchlog`) for previous states.
11. **Logger Usage:** `logger.info` and `logger.error` calls are pervasive for debugging and operational monitoring throughout all changed files.

## 2:18:59 PM
The code changes log reveals an active development phase focused on expanding the frontend of a T360 API application, particularly in areas related to shipping, booking, and regulatory filings (ISF).

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\App.js` (Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:23:18 AM)**
    *   This file shows a substantial expansion of the application's routing. Numerous new pages and components have been integrated, including screens for ALC, shipping orders, container reports, PDF parsing, ALC dashboards, various tracking types (FCL, LCL, Rail, Air), and extensive dashboards (ISF, 7501, Booking).
    *   New user management features, master data forms (Customer, Party, Agent, City, Port), and planboard functionalities have been added.
    *   Authentication has been updated to include `Auth0Login` and `Auth0LogoutHandler`, alongside a `HandleAuthCallback`.
    *   Role-based access control using `ProtectedRoute` and a wide array of `UserRoleEnum` values (`ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER`, `AGENT`, `FRONTOFFICE`, `BACKOFFICE`, etc.) is heavily applied across the new routes, indicating a complex permission structure.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\IsfListDetails.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 12/11/2025, 11:57:05 AM and 12:53:22 PM)**
    *   This component, initially designed to display ISF details for a given booking, underwent significant flux.
    *   **11:57:05 AM:** Initial setup fetching ISF dashboard data (`useFetchIsfDashboardV2Query`) and displaying it using `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING`.
    *   **12:12:10 PM - 12:16:25 PM:** A series of changes involved temporarily switching the `ThemedGrid`'s data source and `uniqueId` prop, leading to potential data display issues, which were then reverted, indicating a debugging and correction cycle.
    *   **12:36:19 PM - 12:43:49 PM:** Introduction of `useGetAgentBookingBolQuery` to fetch Bill of Lading (BOL) data. The component's `ThemedGrid` was then intentionally switched from displaying ISF data (`ISFData?.data`) to BOL data (`bolData?.data`), signifying a change in the component's purpose or an added sub-feature to view BOLs related to the booking within this ISF context. The `uniqueId` was adjusted to `"serial_id"`.
    *   **12:46:21 PM - 12:53:22 PM:** The column definition used for the `ThemedGrid` was changed from `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING` to `BL_COLUMNS_FOR_ISF_BOOKING`, further confirming the shift to displaying BOL data. The column function `BL_COLUMNS_FOR_ISF_BOOKING` was updated to receive `nav` and `access` arguments.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Multiple timestamps between 12/11/2025, 12:13:12 PM and 12:55:01 PM)**
    *   This file defines column configurations for data grids related to ISF.
    *   **12:13:12 PM:** Initial definition of `ISF_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS` and `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING`, with custom `renderCell` functions for displaying status chips, date formatting, and handling MBL/HBL numbers.
    *   **12:14:00 PM - 12:45:03 PM:** `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING` was modified to include `agent_booking_id`, then changed the `blno` field to `bl_no`, and subsequently had `blno` and `agent_booking_id` columns removed.
    *   **12:46:08 PM:** The `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING` export was entirely commented out, indicating its deprecation or replacement, likely by a new column definition like `BL_COLUMNS_FOR_ISF_BOOKING` (though `BL_COLUMNS_FOR_ISF_BOOKING` is not defined in the provided snippet, its usage in `IsfListDetails.jsx` implies its existence elsewhere).
    *   Later timestamps primarily show no functional changes, indicating minor saves or formatting.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\cng-booking\form\BLForm.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 12/11/2025, 12:17:15 PM and 12:19:29 PM)**
    *   Manages Bill of Lading (BL) details within an accordion structure for CNG bookings.
    *   It fetches BOL data, displays it in an `AppTable` using `CNG_BOOKING_BL_COLUMN`, and provides modals for adding (`AddCngBLForm`) or editing (`EditCngBLForm`) BOLs.
    *   A minor textual typo in the header ("BL Details11" to "BL Details") was corrected.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\booking\AgentBookingAddBL.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 12/11/2025, 12:18:18 PM and 12:20:53 PM)**
    *   Similar to `BLForm.jsx`, this component handles Bill of Lading details, but specifically for agent bookings.
    *   It uses `useGetAgentBookingBolQuery`, `AGENT_BOOKING_BL_COLUMNS`, and `AddEditAgentBLForm` in a modal.
    *   A `console.log` statement was added for debugging `BL data`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\ISFForm.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 12/11/2025, 1:29:30 PM and 1:35:45 PM)**
    *   This is a comprehensive form for Importer Security Filing (ISF), featuring numerous tabbed sub-forms for various parties (Shipper, Supplier, Importer, etc.) and locations.
    *   It integrates with API mutations for saving ISF data, creating XML, and uploading XML, with detailed toast notifications for user feedback.
    *   The form handles "draft" and "final verification" states for saving.
    *   Extensive logic is present for copying data between party types and parsing compound values from select inputs.
    *   **1:30:47 PM - 1:31:51 PM:** The Bill of Lading number (`blno`) initialization logic was refined. It now conditionally populates `blno` from `location.state?.bl_no` when the form `formAction` is "copy" or "with-booking", ensuring better data flow when creating ISF from existing booking contexts.
    *   A significant user experience enhancement is the introduction of several **keyboard shortcuts** (Ctrl+U for edit party, Ctrl+D for view parties, Ctrl+A for add new party, Ctrl+Enter for save, Ctrl+S for save progress, Ctrl+P for focus party).
    *   The component uses Redux for managing the currently active party code in a tab and features `ProgressMoniter` and `CircularProgressWithLabel` for visual progress feedback.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **RTK Query (Redux Toolkit Query):** Widely used for data fetching (`useFetch...Query`, `useGet...Query`) and mutations (`useSave...Mutation`, `useIsfDescXmlCreateMutation`, `useIsfDescXmlUploadMutation`) across several components, indicating a consistent approach to API interaction.
*   **Material-UI Components:** A strong reliance on Material-UI (`Box`, `Stack`, `Chip`, `Typography`, `Accordion`, `ThemedModal`, `IconButton`) and custom wrappers (`ThemedGrid`, `OutlinedButton`, `ThemeButton`, `AppTable`, `AppAccordion`) for building the user interface.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Evident in `App.js` with `ProtectedRoute` and `UserRoleEnum`, emphasizing a secure, multi-user application.
*   **Form Management with Formik:** `Formik` is consistently used for complex forms like `ISFForm.jsx`, combined with `yup` for validation (implied by `ISFvalidationSchema`).
*   **Programmatic Navigation:** `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` is a common pattern for redirecting users after actions or to new form states.
*   **User Feedback with `react-hot-toast`:** Toast notifications are liberally used to inform users about the status of operations (saving, XML creation, upload success/failure).
*   **Data Grid Presentation:** `ThemedGrid` is the standard for displaying lists of data, often configured with dynamic `GridActions` and `appDateFormat` for consistent date display.
*   **BL/ISF Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around Bill of Lading and Importer Security Filing, indicating these are critical features currently under active development and refinement, including the integration between them.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The presence of `console.log` statements in various files and rapid revert-and-fix changes points to an active development environment with ongoing debugging and iteration.
*   **UX Enhancements:** The addition of keyboard shortcuts in `ISFForm.jsx` highlights an effort to improve the efficiency and usability for power users.

## 3:18:50 PM
The codebase underwent a series of focused updates on December 11, 2025, primarily concentrating on enhancing booking, Importer Security Filing (ISF), and Bill of Lading (BL) functionalities within the T360-frontend application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\App.js` (12/11/2025, 10:23:18 AM)**:
    This file saw a significant expansion of routes and component imports. Numerous new screens and features were integrated, including `Auth0Login`, `ISFDashboardScreen`, various tracking screens (`FCLScreen`, `LCLScreen`, `RailScreen`, `AirTrackingScreen`), extended booking and PO order forms (`AgentBookingFormScreenExtend`, `AgentPoFormExtend`), `CngBookingScreen`, `CityMaster`, `PortmasterScreen`, and report scheduling. Existing routes like "booking" and "booking/form" were updated to use the `_Extend` versions of their respective screens, indicating an evolution or refactor of these modules. Access control via `ProtectedRoute` and `UserRoleEnum` was consistently applied across new and updated routes. A `console.log` statement was present, likely for debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\IsfListDetails.jsx` (Frequent changes between 12/11/2025, 11:57:05 AM and 12/11/2025, 12:53:22 PM)**:
    This component, responsible for displaying ISF list details, underwent several rapid iterations:
    *   Initially displayed ISF data using `useFetchIsfDashboardV2Query` and `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING`.
    *   Temporarily switched the data source for `ThemedGrid` to its own `data` prop and changed the `uniqueId`. These changes were quickly reverted.
    *   Introduced `useGetAgentBookingBolQuery` to fetch Bill of Lading (BOL) data, initially with a variable shadowing issue that was later corrected.
    *   The `ThemedGrid` was then updated to display `bolData` (BOL information) instead of `ISFData`.
    *   The column definition for the grid was explicitly changed to `BL_COLUMNS_FOR_ISF_BOOKING`, and eventually, `nav` (for navigation) was also passed to this column definition function.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\data\columns\isf-dashboard.js` (Frequent changes between 12/11/2025, 12:13:12 PM and 12/11/2025, 12:55:01 PM)**:
    This file defines column structures for ISF-related grids.
    *   The `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING` definition was modified:
        *   An "Agent Booking ID" column was added, then later removed.
        *   The `field` for "B/L No" was changed from `"blno"` to `"bl_no"`.
        *   Ultimately, the entire `ISF_COLUMNS_FOR_BOOKING` export was commented out, indicating a shift away from its direct use, likely in favor of `BL_COLUMNS_FOR_ISF_BOOKING` as seen in `IsfListDetails.jsx`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\cng-booking\form\BLForm.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:17:15 PM and 12:19:29 PM)**:
    This component manages BL details within CNG bookings. A minor textual change occurred, updating the header from "BL Details11" to "BL Details".

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\pages\booking\AgentBookingAddBL.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:18:18 PM and 12/11/2025, 12:20:53 PM)**:
    This component handles adding/editing BLs for agent bookings. A `console.log` statement was added for debugging the fetched BL data.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\components\screen\booking\isf\ISFForm.jsx` (Frequent changes between 12/11/2025, 1:29:30 PM and 12/11/2025, 1:35:45 PM)**:
    This complex ISF form component saw several adjustments focused on `blno` (Bill of Lading number) initialization:
    *   The `handleSave` function was updated to conditionally use `location.state?.bl_no` if `values.blno` was empty.
    *   The `Formik` `initialValues` logic for `blno` was progressively refined. Initially, if `formAction` was 'copy', it defaulted to an empty string. This was updated to also check `location.state?.bl_no` and then expanded to apply the `location.state?.bl_no` default when `formAction` is 'copy' or 'with-booking'.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Development on 12/11/2025**: The clustered timestamps indicate a period of highly active development and iterative changes, particularly around the ISF and booking-related features.
*   **Focus on ISF and BOL Integration**: A major theme is the detailed work on Importer Security Filing (ISF) forms and the display of Bill of Lading (BOL) data. This includes fetching and presenting BOL data within ISF contexts, and refining how BL numbers are handled during ISF form creation (especially for 'copy' or 'with-booking' actions).
*   **Modular UI Components**: Consistent use of reusable UI components like `ThemedGrid`, `AppTable`, `ThemedModal`, `GridActions`, and form-specific components (e.g., `ISFHeaderForm`, `ShipperForm`) to build complex interfaces.
*   **Data Fetching and State Management**: Reliance on RTK Query (`useFetch...Query`, `useSave...Mutation`) for API interactions and `react-redux` (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for global state, alongside `useReducer` for local component state.
*   **Robust Routing and Access Control**: The `App.js` file demonstrates a comprehensive routing strategy with extensive use of `AuthGuard` and `ProtectedRoute` to enforce role-based access to different parts of the application.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The presence of `console.log` statements in multiple files indicates an active debugging process during development.
*   **Enhanced User Interaction**: The implementation of keyboard shortcuts in `ISFForm.jsx` highlights an effort to improve user efficiency and experience for complex forms.
