# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 1:38:53 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` module and the `config.js` file.  The `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file underwent significant changes between 12:06 PM and 1:30 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the logic for updating ETD (Estimated Time of Departure) and ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) data.

Initially, the script fetched `agent_booking_id` to update ETD and ETA.  Subsequent revisions changed the primary key used for fetching data from `mblno` (Master Bill of Lading number),  indicating a shift to using the MBL number as the identifier for updates. The database query targeting `mtr_tracking` was modified to use `mtr_tracking_data` and the fields queried were also changed from `etd` and `eta` to `departure_date` and `t49_eta`, and later, the code was updated to use the fields  `departure_date` and `t49_eta` instead of `etd` and `eta`  when assigning values to `newETD` and `newETA`.  Finally,  `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes.

The `config.js` file was updated several times between 12:33 PM and 1:36 PM, primarily to switch between production and development environments, and in the process,  the database connection details were changed, reflecting a transition to a local database ("Rida_Database") with credentials  "postgres" and "12345678" for the development environment, along with changing the host from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost`.  The production configuration remains largely unchanged, consistently pointing to a remote AWS RDS instance.  Notably, the `environment` variable was toggled between `'production'` and `'development'` to effect this change.  The file also includes sensitive information which has been omitted from this summary.

The `run.UpdateShipDate.js` script shows a basic batch processing structure that uses the `isfShipDateUpdate` module and logs execution start and end times.  There are no modifications made to the script itself during this logging period.
