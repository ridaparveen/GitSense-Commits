# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 1:38:53 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` module and the `config.js` file.  The `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file underwent significant changes between 12:06 PM and 1:30 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the logic for updating ETD (Estimated Time of Departure) and ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) data.

Initially, the script fetched `agent_booking_id` to update ETD and ETA.  Subsequent revisions changed the primary key used for fetching data from `mblno` (Master Bill of Lading number),  indicating a shift to using the MBL number as the identifier for updates. The database query targeting `mtr_tracking` was modified to use `mtr_tracking_data` and the fields queried were also changed from `etd` and `eta` to `departure_date` and `t49_eta`, and later, the code was updated to use the fields  `departure_date` and `t49_eta` instead of `etd` and `eta`  when assigning values to `newETD` and `newETA`.  Finally,  `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes.

The `config.js` file was updated several times between 12:33 PM and 1:36 PM, primarily to switch between production and development environments, and in the process,  the database connection details were changed, reflecting a transition to a local database ("Rida_Database") with credentials  "postgres" and "12345678" for the development environment, along with changing the host from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost`.  The production configuration remains largely unchanged, consistently pointing to a remote AWS RDS instance.  Notably, the `environment` variable was toggled between `'production'` and `'development'` to effect this change.  The file also includes sensitive information which has been omitted from this summary.

The `run.UpdateShipDate.js` script shows a basic batch processing structure that uses the `isfShipDateUpdate` module and logs execution start and end times.  There are no modifications made to the script itself during this logging period.


## 2:38:54 PM
The log shows a series of updates to `isf.shipdateupdate.js`, a Node.js module responsible for updating Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) data in a database.  The changes primarily focus on refining the update logic and adding audit logging functionality.


**Key Changes over Time:**

* **8/8/2025, 1:44:50 PM:** Initial version.  The code uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` to update `agent_booking_routing` table with ETD and ETA from `mtr_tracking_data` based on `mblno` and `agent_booking_id`. It skips updates if both ETD and ETA already exist.

* **8/8/2025, 1:51:57 PM & 8/8/2025, 1:53:56 PM:** Minor improvements in logging and code clarity. The `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` is changed to a simple `UPDATE` statement.  Additional logging messages are added to track processing of individual bookings.


* **8/8/2025, 2:08:21 PM & 8/8/2025, 2:10:21 PM:**  Further refinement of the logging messages and error handling. The code now checks the `rowCount` of the UPDATE query to identify cases where the `agent_booking_id` is not found in the `agent_booking_routing` table and logs warnings for those cases.  Minor stylistic changes to log messages are also present.


* **8/8/2025, 2:27:19 PM & 8/8/2025, 2:34:01 PM & 8/8/2025, 2:36:24 PM:**  Significant addition of audit logging. An `insertAudit` function is introduced to log changes to the `etd` and `eta` fields in a separate `isf_audit_log` table.  The audit log records the changed fields (`field_name`), old and new values, timestamp, and the responsible user/process. Also, in the last commit, the `COALESCE` function is removed from the UPDATE query to directly update the values, and the skip condition `if (etdExists && etaExists)` is commented out, implying that even if both ETD and ETA exist, the update will proceed.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Frequent updates to logging statements, improving clarity and providing more detailed feedback.
* Consistent use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for database interactions.
* The core logic involves retrieving data from `agent_booking_entry` and `mtr_tracking_data` tables, and updating the `agent_booking_routing` table.
* The code always handles potential errors gracefully using `try...catch` blocks.


**File-Specific Updates:**

The `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file underwent significant evolution, progressing from a basic ETD/ETA update script to a more robust and auditable system.  The key improvement is the addition of audit logging, enhancing the traceability and accountability of data changes.


## 3:38:52 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `isf.shipdateupdate.js` between 2:40 PM and 3:01 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These updates primarily focus on refining the logic within the `updateEtdAndEta` function of the `IsfShipDateUpdate` class.  The initial version lacked a check for pre-existing ETD and ETA values, resulting in unnecessary updates. Subsequent commits added this check and also improved logging by adding comments to clarify the code's purpose. A minor change in one commit involved adding `agent_booking_id` to the `insertAudit` function parameters.  The changes in `isf.shipdateupdate.js` did not change the core functionality, but instead improved efficiency and clarity.

A separate `run.UpdateShipDate.js` script was added at 2:48:08 PM on August 8th, 2025, acting as a wrapper to execute the `updateEtdAndEta` function and log the execution time.

Finally, the `config.js` file underwent changes between 3:29 PM and 3:32 PM on August 8th, 2025, switching the `environment` variable from `production` to `development`.  This resulted in the application using the `development` configuration settings, rather than `production` ones.  The specific changes within the configurations are not shown here due to containing sensitive information.


## 4:38:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file between 4:06 PM and 4:09 PM on August 8th, 2025.  The code updates Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) values in an ISF (likely International Shipping Facilitation) system.

The core logic remains consistent throughout all revisions:

1. **Data Retrieval:** The script fetches `agent_booking_id` and `mblno` (Master Bill of Lading number) from the `agent_booking_entry` table.  It then retrieves ETD and ETA from `agent_booking_routing` and departure date and T49 ETA from `mtr_tracking_data` based on the `agent_booking_id` and `mblno` respectively.

2. **Conditional Update:** If ETD and ETA already exist, the script skips the update. Otherwise, it updates `agent_booking_routing` with `departure_date` and `t49_eta` from `mtr_tracking_data` if available, logging warnings for missing data.

3. **Audit Logging:**  An `insertAudit` function logs all updates to the `isf_audit_log` table, recording the field name, old and new values, and the `agent_booking_id`.

The key changes across revisions are:

* **Variable Naming Consistency:** Early revisions used inconsistent variable names (`routing` vs `routingInfo`). This was corrected in later revisions using `routingInfo` consistently.

* **Log Message Clarity:** The log messages regarding skipped updates were improved for better clarity (e.g., "ETD/ETA already present" changed to "ETD & ETA already exist").

* **Error Handling:** The error handling remains consistent throughout.

* **MTR Data Handling:** The variable name for the MTR data was changed from `mtr` to `mtrData` for better clarity.

* **Null Check Enhancement:** The condition to check for missing MTR data (`!mtr || (!mtr.departure_date && !mtr.t49_eta)`) was made slightly more readable.

* **Update Skip Message:** The warning message for skipped updates due to no routing row found became more explicit.

* **Audit Log Enhancement:** The final revisions added a comment indicating the purpose of audit logging and corrected a minor error in the `agent_booking_id` parameter in one `insertAudit` call and added it to the other.

* **Condition to Update Values:** The final revision checks if `newETD` and `newETA` have values before updating.


The revisions demonstrate a process of refinement, focusing on improving code readability, clarity of logging messages, and robustness. The core functionality of updating ETD and ETA based on data from different tables and logging changes remains unchanged.


## 5:16:06 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to two React component files: `ShipperModelForm.tsx` and `EnquiryDetailsForm.tsx`.  The changes span approximately an hour, between 4:36 PM and 4:59 PM on August 8th, 2025.

**`ShipperModelForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **Initial State (4:36 PM):**  The component initially rendered a grid of numerous `InputBox` components, all with the same `name` attribute ("customer_name"), indicating an incomplete or placeholder structure.

* **4:40 PM:** A "Close" button using the `Button` component was added, along with a prop (`onClose`) to handle the button's click event, suggesting the component was meant to be a modal.

* **4:57 PM:** A significant revision occurred. The component was refactored to accept a `formType` prop and conditionally render elements based on whether it's a shipper or consignee form.  Input fields were updated to reflect this, with labels like "Shipper Name" or "Consignee Name," and the addition of fields for email, contact person, mobile, tel, fax, URL, address lines, city, state, postal code, status, tax number, and IES party. The `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components were used.

* **4:58 PM:**  The component reverted almost entirely to its state after the 4:40 PM update,  containing only a Close button and multiple `InputBox` components, again all with identical, placeholder names. This suggests an interruption or an undoing of the earlier, more complete revision.

* **5:05 PM:** The component was updated to a more complete form than that at 4:57pm, including the additions of multiple `SelectBox` components for country, state, and city,  along with more complete fields and labels.


**`EnquiryDetailsForm.tsx` Updates:**

* **4:41 PM:** The initial commit of this form included a large number of `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components for various aspects of an enquiry, including enquiry type, number, date, customer name, shipper, consignee, locations, addresses, commodity details, remarks, and hazardous goods status.  Import statements included the `ShipperModelForm`, `DynamicEditableTable`, `AppGrid`, and `BaseModal` components.   A modal was included that opened using the `ShipperModelForm`, initially appearing to only display the shipper information.

* **4:41 PM & 4:42 PM:** Minor changes were made where the title of the modal changed, and then later the `onClick` for the InputGroupedButton components was updated to open the modal.

* **4:43 PM:** The title of the modal was updated to allow both Shipper and Consignee information to be added.

* **4:45 PM:** The modal's title was adjusted. The `open.type` property in the `useState` hook was updated to reflect both 'ship-info' and 'con-info' states in the `title` property of the `BaseModal` component.

* **4:46 PM:**  The modal size was increased, updated to "2xl".

* **4:48 PM:** The conditional rendering logic in the modal changed to use an `||` operator instead of `&&` for checking the `open.type` variable. This condition was simplified from  `(open.type === "ship-info" || "con-info")` to `(open.type === "ship-info" || open.type === "con-info")`. The modal size was changed to "4xl".

* **4:49 PM:** The modal size was updated to "4xl"

* **4:53 PM:** The `onClose` function in the `BaseModal` component was updated to maintain the `open.type` property when closing the modal, allowing for the possibility of opening a 'con-info' modal later.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
* Consistent use of Formik for form management.
* The repeated use of `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components.
* Multiple changes to the `EnquiryDetailsForm` component relate to the handling and display of a modal containing the `ShipperModelForm` component for adding Shipper and Consignee information.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, with several commits refining the `EnquiryDetailsForm` primarily focused on improving the integration and functionality of the modal for adding shipper and consignee information.  There are also several apparent reversions in `ShipperModelForm.tsx` , suggesting some experimentation and refactoring.


## 6:15:58 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `BoxPlanForm.tsx` and `ShippingBillTable.tsx` components.  The primary focus of the changes is on improving the UI and functionality of a shipping bill table within the Box Plan form.

**BoxPlanForm.tsx:**  The `BoxPlanForm.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 5:49 PM and 6:06 PM.  The most significant changes involved refactoring the "Shipping Bills (Hub Stuffing)" section. Initially, this section used a mix of `AppGrid` and `DynamicEditableTable` components.  Later revisions replaced this with a dedicated `ShippingBillTable` component, streamlining the code and improving maintainability.  Minor styling adjustments were also made during this period, primarily affecting the add button and positioning of elements within the card.  The core functionality of the form, including form submission and input fields, remained largely unchanged.

**ShippingBillTable.tsx:** This component's evolution is marked by a substantial transformation from a custom table implementation using plain HTML elements (`<table>`, `<tr>`, etc.) to a component leveraging a `ClientGrid` component (likely a custom grid component). This refactor happened between 5:58 PM and 6:15 PM. The initial version was a basic table with add and delete row functionalities. The final version uses a more sophisticated grid component, along with styled `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components for the editable row. The styling of the table was refined with the addition of borders and shadows, along with repositioning of elements using `sticky` classes.  The changes culminate in a cleaner, more organized, and potentially more performant table implementation.  The use of  `HiMiniTrash` from `react-icons/hi2` replaced `FaRegTrashAlt` from `react-icons/fa` for the delete icon.


## 7:16:36 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `ShippingBillTable.tsx` component over a short period (approximately 30 minutes) on August 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the table's visual presentation and the handling of editable rows.

Initially, the table used a `ClientGrid` component.  Subsequent edits transitioned it to a standard HTML table (`<table>`), enhancing its styling with Tailwind CSS classes.  This involved iterative adjustments to spacing, borders (`border-separate`, `border-spacing-y-1`, `border-[#E4E4E7]`), padding (`px-3 py-2`, `px-2 py-2`), shadows (`shadow-sm`), and background colors (`bg-white`, `bg-gray-200`, `bg-gray-50`).  The `z-index` was also modified to correctly layer sticky elements. The width of the `InputBox` components within the table were changed multiple times, settling on `w-[500px]` for the "Shipping Bill No." input.

The add and delete row functionalities remained consistent throughout, using `IoIosAddCircle` and `HiMiniTrash` icons respectively.  However, their positioning and styling within the table were significantly altered, moving from a sticky header to a sticky right column. The delete button in the editable row was initially styled differently using various Tailwind classes before ultimately being consolidated to a consistent style.

The data structure (`ShippingBill`) remained unchanged.  There was some experimentation with the table's structure, including the number of columns and how the "Cargo Type" column was handled before settling on a final structure. The `DynamicEditableTable` component was introduced and significantly improved from its first version, adding support for different input types and styling enhancements.  The final version includes a min-width for better responsiveness (`min-w-[1000px]`).  The final changes focused on border and styling adjustments, particularly for cleaner visual appearance and improved layout.
