# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 1:38:53 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` module and the `config.js` file.  The `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file underwent significant changes between 12:06 PM and 1:30 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the logic for updating ETD (Estimated Time of Departure) and ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) data.

Initially, the script fetched `agent_booking_id` to update ETD and ETA.  Subsequent revisions changed the primary key used for fetching data from `mblno` (Master Bill of Lading number),  indicating a shift to using the MBL number as the identifier for updates. The database query targeting `mtr_tracking` was modified to use `mtr_tracking_data` and the fields queried were also changed from `etd` and `eta` to `departure_date` and `t49_eta`, and later, the code was updated to use the fields  `departure_date` and `t49_eta` instead of `etd` and `eta`  when assigning values to `newETD` and `newETA`.  Finally,  `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes.

The `config.js` file was updated several times between 12:33 PM and 1:36 PM, primarily to switch between production and development environments, and in the process,  the database connection details were changed, reflecting a transition to a local database ("Rida_Database") with credentials  "postgres" and "12345678" for the development environment, along with changing the host from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost`.  The production configuration remains largely unchanged, consistently pointing to a remote AWS RDS instance.  Notably, the `environment` variable was toggled between `'production'` and `'development'` to effect this change.  The file also includes sensitive information which has been omitted from this summary.

The `run.UpdateShipDate.js` script shows a basic batch processing structure that uses the `isfShipDateUpdate` module and logs execution start and end times.  There are no modifications made to the script itself during this logging period.


## 2:38:54 PM
The log shows a series of updates to `isf.shipdateupdate.js`, a Node.js module responsible for updating Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) data in a database.  The changes primarily focus on refining the update logic and adding audit logging functionality.


**Key Changes over Time:**

* **8/8/2025, 1:44:50 PM:** Initial version.  The code uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` to update `agent_booking_routing` table with ETD and ETA from `mtr_tracking_data` based on `mblno` and `agent_booking_id`. It skips updates if both ETD and ETA already exist.

* **8/8/2025, 1:51:57 PM & 8/8/2025, 1:53:56 PM:** Minor improvements in logging and code clarity. The `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` is changed to a simple `UPDATE` statement.  Additional logging messages are added to track processing of individual bookings.


* **8/8/2025, 2:08:21 PM & 8/8/2025, 2:10:21 PM:**  Further refinement of the logging messages and error handling. The code now checks the `rowCount` of the UPDATE query to identify cases where the `agent_booking_id` is not found in the `agent_booking_routing` table and logs warnings for those cases.  Minor stylistic changes to log messages are also present.


* **8/8/2025, 2:27:19 PM & 8/8/2025, 2:34:01 PM & 8/8/2025, 2:36:24 PM:**  Significant addition of audit logging. An `insertAudit` function is introduced to log changes to the `etd` and `eta` fields in a separate `isf_audit_log` table.  The audit log records the changed fields (`field_name`), old and new values, timestamp, and the responsible user/process. Also, in the last commit, the `COALESCE` function is removed from the UPDATE query to directly update the values, and the skip condition `if (etdExists && etaExists)` is commented out, implying that even if both ETD and ETA exist, the update will proceed.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Frequent updates to logging statements, improving clarity and providing more detailed feedback.
* Consistent use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for database interactions.
* The core logic involves retrieving data from `agent_booking_entry` and `mtr_tracking_data` tables, and updating the `agent_booking_routing` table.
* The code always handles potential errors gracefully using `try...catch` blocks.


**File-Specific Updates:**

The `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file underwent significant evolution, progressing from a basic ETD/ETA update script to a more robust and auditable system.  The key improvement is the addition of audit logging, enhancing the traceability and accountability of data changes.


## 3:38:52 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `isf.shipdateupdate.js` between 2:40 PM and 3:01 PM on August 8th, 2025.  These updates primarily focus on refining the logic within the `updateEtdAndEta` function of the `IsfShipDateUpdate` class.  The initial version lacked a check for pre-existing ETD and ETA values, resulting in unnecessary updates. Subsequent commits added this check and also improved logging by adding comments to clarify the code's purpose. A minor change in one commit involved adding `agent_booking_id` to the `insertAudit` function parameters.  The changes in `isf.shipdateupdate.js` did not change the core functionality, but instead improved efficiency and clarity.

A separate `run.UpdateShipDate.js` script was added at 2:48:08 PM on August 8th, 2025, acting as a wrapper to execute the `updateEtdAndEta` function and log the execution time.

Finally, the `config.js` file underwent changes between 3:29 PM and 3:32 PM on August 8th, 2025, switching the `environment` variable from `production` to `development`.  This resulted in the application using the `development` configuration settings, rather than `production` ones.  The specific changes within the configurations are not shown here due to containing sensitive information.
