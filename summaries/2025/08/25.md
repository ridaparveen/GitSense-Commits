# Activity Summary for 8/25/2025

## 12:33:26 PM
The file `dashboardService.ts` contains two main functions: `getDashboardCardInfo` and `getDeliveryData`.  Both functions interact with a database (`mtr_tracking_data`) using custom SQL queries.

`getDashboardCardInfo` (updated 8/25/2025, 11:41:34 AM) retrieves dashboard card information by constructing a SQL query that counts shipments based on several conditions related to departure and arrival dates, using filtering to categorize them into "pending departure," "in transit," "ETA within 1 week," and "out for delivery." The query dynamically includes date range filters (`fromDate`, `toDate`) from the request.  It uses `buildMtrUserCondition` to incorporate user-specific conditions. The function logs various stages of processing using a logger.

`getDeliveryData` retrieves delivery data based on a type parameter ('delivery' or 'vessel').  It executes different SQL queries depending on this type.  For 'delivery', it selects distinct MBL numbers along with delivery information, while for 'vessel', it selects vessel arrival information. Both queries include a condition to exclude shipments marked as 'shipment_completed = Yes' and use `buildMtrUserCondition` for user-specific filtering. This function also logs query execution and results.  Both functions utilize the `query` function from `@src/common/util/database` for database interaction and return results with appropriate HTTP status codes.  A recurring element is the use of `buildMtrUserCondition` and error handling with HTTP status codes.  The queries heavily rely on  `mtr_tracking_data` table and columns related to shipment tracking, including various dates and statuses (e.g., `departure_date`, `vessel_actualdeparted_date`, `t49_vessel_actualarrived_date`, `shipment_completed`).


## 12:33:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `shipment-coulmns.tsx` between 11:54 AM and 12:10 PM on August 25, 2025, focusing on adjustments to column definitions for shipment data grids.  These adjustments primarily involved minor tweaks to header names, `minWidth` properties, and  link paths within the `renderCell` functions.  There's no significant change in the overall structure or functionality of the code during this period.  The most noticeable pattern is the iterative refinement of column widths and  route links in different parts of the code.


Between 12:18 PM and 12:25 PM on August 25, 2025, there were several revisions to `shipment-details-page.tsx`.  These changes involved primarily cosmetic and presentational updates.  The main changes were to the styling and layout of information displayed on the page  and several minor text changes, like correcting the label "Arrived1" to "Arrived" in `getPriorityDateLabel`.  A new `info-container` was added and some information was moved around.  The final revision at 12:25 PM added a new console log for debugging.
