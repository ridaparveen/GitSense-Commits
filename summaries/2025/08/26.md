# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 10:41:48 AM
The log shows modifications to three files between 6:13 PM and 6:37 PM on August 25th, 2025, and a further update at 10:34 AM on August 26th, 2025.

The primary focus of the changes is on the `dashboard-page.tsx` file, which contains the main dashboard UI.  Several updates were made to the data fetching and filtering logic within this component.  The most significant change in this file involves refining the filtering logic for `deliveryData` based on `deliveryMode` in the `useMemo` hook responsible for preparing calendar data. This improved the filtering of vessel data based on delivery mode (Door Delivery, Port Delivery, Rail Delivery, All).  An additional condition `delivery.pod` was also added in the filtering logic for Port Delivery.

The `Calender.tsx` component underwent minor updates.  A key change between the first two entries (6:13 PM and 6:13 PM)  was the addition of an "All" option to the delivery mode select element, allowing for the display of all delivery types. The component consistently uses the `moment` library for date formatting and manipulation.

The `delivery.type.ts` file shows the addition of the `eta_pod` field to the `DeliveryType` interface, reflecting a change in the data structure between 6:34 PM and 6:35 PM and remains the same until 6:37 PM. This addition likely corresponds to the changes in `dashboard-page.tsx` for handling Port Delivery filtering.


The `shipment-coulmns.tsx` file was updated on August 26th.  The changes involve minor adjustments to the column definitions for the shipment data grid, primarily focused on styling and link paths. No significant logic changes are present in this update.  The most noticeable change is the updates to the link paths within the `renderCell` functions, ensuring correct navigation to shipment details.


## 10:41:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `dashboardService.ts` file, focusing on the `getDashboardCardInfo` and `getDeliveryData` functions.  The primary changes revolve around refining the SQL queries within these functions.

The `getDashboardCardInfo` function consistently uses a complex SQL query to retrieve dashboard information categorized into "Pending Departure," "In Transit," "ETA within 1 week," and "Out for Delivery."  The query includes calculations for both count and TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit).  Minor revisions involved changes to how the `fromDate` and `toDate` query parameters are handled in the `WHERE` clause, specifically addressing potential "null" values.  These changes occurred between 6:08 PM and 6:31 PM, with no significant structural alterations to the SQL query itself.

The `getDeliveryData` function retrieves delivery data based on the 'type' (delivery or vessel) and optionally 'mode' (Door Delivery, Port Delivery, Rail Delivery, or ALL) parameters. The core SQL queries for both 'delivery' and 'vessel' types remain largely unchanged, but the logic for applying filters based on the `mode` parameter has been subject to several revisions throughout the 6:08 PM to 6:31 PM period. The changes aim at more precisely defining filtering conditions within the vessel query, especially for the "Rail Delivery" and "ALL" modes, ensuring `eta_pod` and `pod` are consistently checked for non-null values.  The `ALL` mode was added in later revisions to handle a broader selection criteria.


## 11:41:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `dashboard-page.tsx` component and the `Calender.tsx` component between 11:05 AM and 11:36 AM on August 26, 2025.  `dashboard-page.tsx` underwent several minor revisions, primarily focused on refining the display of data fetching states (adding loading indicators) and possibly correcting a bug in the `filteredVessels` logic within the `useMemo` hook.  The changes in `dashboard-page.tsx` involved primarily adding conditional rendering for loading states within the DatePeriodSelector component. The core functionality and data fetching remained largely consistent.

The `Calender.tsx` component saw more substantial modifications across several commits.  The changes focused primarily on styling and conditional rendering based on the `deliveryMode` prop.  Specifically, the background color of delivery items in the calendar was adjusted to reflect different delivery modes ("Door Delivery," "Port Delivery," "Rail Delivery," and "All").  The style was initially implemented using the `cn` utility and a ternary operator but later refactored into a cleaner `style` attribute for better readability,  using a more straightforward conditional statement to determine the background color based on the delivery mode.  These changes improve the visual presentation of the calendar data by providing better visual distinction based on delivery type.  Finally, a minor improvement was made in the `Link` component to make the `to` prop clearer.
