# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 10:41:48 AM
The log shows modifications to three files between 6:13 PM and 6:37 PM on August 25th, 2025, and a further update at 10:34 AM on August 26th, 2025.

The primary focus of the changes is on the `dashboard-page.tsx` file, which contains the main dashboard UI.  Several updates were made to the data fetching and filtering logic within this component.  The most significant change in this file involves refining the filtering logic for `deliveryData` based on `deliveryMode` in the `useMemo` hook responsible for preparing calendar data. This improved the filtering of vessel data based on delivery mode (Door Delivery, Port Delivery, Rail Delivery, All).  An additional condition `delivery.pod` was also added in the filtering logic for Port Delivery.

The `Calender.tsx` component underwent minor updates.  A key change between the first two entries (6:13 PM and 6:13 PM)  was the addition of an "All" option to the delivery mode select element, allowing for the display of all delivery types. The component consistently uses the `moment` library for date formatting and manipulation.

The `delivery.type.ts` file shows the addition of the `eta_pod` field to the `DeliveryType` interface, reflecting a change in the data structure between 6:34 PM and 6:35 PM and remains the same until 6:37 PM. This addition likely corresponds to the changes in `dashboard-page.tsx` for handling Port Delivery filtering.


The `shipment-coulmns.tsx` file was updated on August 26th.  The changes involve minor adjustments to the column definitions for the shipment data grid, primarily focused on styling and link paths. No significant logic changes are present in this update.  The most noticeable change is the updates to the link paths within the `renderCell` functions, ensuring correct navigation to shipment details.
