# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 9:30:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `VesselDetailsPage.tsx` on August 29, 2025, between 6:00 PM and 6:05 PM.  The primary changes center around the `initialValues` object within the component.

Initially, `initialValues` lacked a `serail_id` property.  This was added in a revision at approximately 6:03 PM.  Subsequent revisions (around 6:04 PM and 6:05 PM) focused on minor formatting and type annotations for the `handleSubmit` function's parameters (`values` and `mode`), improving code readability and maintainability.  The addition of `serail_id` to `initialValues` is the most significant functional change, likely to ensure the component correctly handles and sends this essential piece of data.  The order of `toast.success()` and `setTimeout()` was also adjusted within the `handleSubmit` function in a minor revision at approximately 6:04 PM, which doesn't significantly affect functionality, but aims to improve user experience.  There were no other major changes to the file's structure or functionality.
