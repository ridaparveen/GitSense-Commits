## 2:56:23 PM
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within the `envosys-frontend` project on August 6th, 2025.  The most significant changes center around the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` component and its associated data structures.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\vessel-voyage-columns.tsx`:** This file underwent multiple revisions between 12:07 PM and 12:08 PM, primarily adjusting the `width` property of several columns in the `VESSEL_VOYAGE_COLUMNS` constant.  The width of the 'POL' and 'POL ETA' columns were increased from 150 to 200. Finally, a new constant `RoutingDetailsColumn` was added, defining columns for a dynamic editable table. The width of these columns was also increased later to 180px.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx`:** This file was modified twice, between 12:11 PM and 12:12 PM. The changes involved minor adjustments to the UI, primarily related to the layout and labeling within the `VesselVoyagePanel` component.  Specifically, the label of the status filter in the filter configuration was changed from "Status" to "Voyage". The label of the line name filter was changed from "Line Name" to "POL".


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\AddNewVesselVoyage.tsx`:** This file shows minor edits between 12:13 PM and 12:14 PM.  The only significant change was correcting a typo in the card title, changing "Vessel Voyage Details1" to "Vessel Voyage Details".


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`:** This component experienced the most substantial and frequent changes, evolving from a Material-UI based component to a Tailwind CSS based one between 12:14 PM and 12:48 PM.  The changes involved a complete restructuring of the UI using a grid layout (`grid grid-cols-4 gap-6 my-6`).  Many  `InputBox`, `AutocompleteBox`, and `CheckboxField` components were introduced. The commented-out Material-UI code was gradually removed. Also, `AppDatePicker` components were replaced with `InputBox` with `type="date"`.  Importantly, a `DynamicEditableTable` component was integrated to manage routing details, leveraging the `RoutingDetailsColumn` data structure defined in `vessel-voyage-columns.tsx`.  Event handling for the `AutocompleteBox` was enhanced to include `onValueChange` and `handleOptionChange`. Finally, the button styles were changed from Material UI to Tailwind.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsPage.tsx`:** This file was modified several times between 12:15 PM and 12:50 PM.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vendor\VendorDashboard.tsx`:**  This file was extensively modified between 1:06 PM and 1:12 PM, evolving similarly to the `VesselVoyageDetailsForm` component,  integrating  `AppGrid` for better data presentation and enhanced filtering using a `FilterSidebar`. File name in `generateExcel` was also changed from `Vessel_Data.xlsx` to `Vendor_Data.xlsx`. The `filterConfig` was also refactored to use `text` and `checkbox` instead of `search` for better consistency.
