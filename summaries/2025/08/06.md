The width of the 'POL' and 'POL ETA' columns were increased from 150 to 200. Finally, a new constant `RoutingDetailsColumn` was added, defining columns for a dynamic editable table. The width of these columns was also increased later to 180px.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDashboard.tsx`:** This file was modified twice, between 12:11 PM and 12:12 PM. The changes involved minor adjustments to the UI, primarily related to the layout and labeling within the `VesselVoyagePanel` component.  Specifically, the label of the status filter in the filter configuration was changed from "Status" to "Voyage". The label of the line name filter was changed from "Line Name" to "POL".


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\AddNewVesselVoyage.tsx`:** This file shows minor edits between 12:13 PM and 12:14 PM.  The only significant change was correcting a typo in the card title, changing "Vessel Voyage Details1" to "Vessel Voyage Details".


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel-voyage\VesselVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`:** This component experienced the most substantial and frequent changes, evolving from a Material-UI based component to a Tailwind CSS based one between 12:14 PM and 12:48 PM.  The changes involved a complete restructuring of the UI using a grid layout (`grid grid-cols-4 gap-6 my-6`).  Many  `InputBox`, `AutocompleteBox`, and `CheckboxField` components were introduced. The commented-out Material-UI code was gradually removed. Also, `AppDatePicker` components were replaced with `InputBox` with `type="date"`.

## 11:03:10 PM
The log shows development of a travel application, with significant changes across multiple files.

The `globals.css` file underwent substantial revision between 5:28 PM and 5:33 PM.  The initial version imported Tailwind CSS and defined basic light/dark theme variables for background and foreground colors. The second version added an import for `uploadthing/tw/v4`, imported a source from a node module, and significantly expanded the theme variables to include colors for cards, primary/secondary actions, muted text, accents, and destructive actions, all defined using the `oklch` color function. A `dark` class was added for dark mode styling.  The base layer styles were added using tailwind directives.

The `package.json` file was updated at 5:34 PM, reflecting the addition of several new dependencies, including `@uploadthing/react`, `@auth/prisma-adapter`, and `next-auth` suggesting the addition of file uploads, authentication and database integration using Prisma.

The `components/Navbar.tsx` component saw iterative development from 5:40 PM onwards. Initially a simple `nav` element, it evolved to include a logo (`/logo.png` initially, then `/globe.svg`),  styling adjustments (`py-6`, addition of `ml-2` for margin), and finally, at 5:58 PM, the addition of navigation links ("My Trips", "Globe") and a "Sign Out" button, indicating the completion of basic navigation functionality. Further refinements included changes to the logo image. Between 6:37 PM and 10:44 PM the navbar was significantly updated to include conditional rendering based on user session status using NextAuth, dynamically showing either "Sign In" or "My Trips", "Globe", and "Sign Out" links.  The  `use client` directive was added.


The `app/layout.tsx` file was updated at 5:41 PM and 6:47 PM. The first update integrated the `Navbar` component into the page layout. The second added the `auth` function from `auth.ts` to pass the session to the `Navbar` component.

The `lib/prisma.ts` file's update at 6:52 PM changed the import path for `PrismaClient` and adjusted the globalThis assignment for prisma.  A subsequent update at 10:42 PM changed the global object from global to globalThis.

The `auth.ts` file was modified multiple times between 6:25 PM and 10:47 PM. This file handles NextAuth integration. It initially used a `Prisma` adapter, later updated to `PrismaAdapter`, and finally implemented GitHub authentication with environment variables for client ID and secret.  The `secret` was also added. The file included multiple nearly identical commits between 6:25 and 10:48 PM.

The `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` file, updated at 6:31 PM, simply exports the handlers from the `auth` module.

`lib/auth-actions.ts` was updated several times, containing simple `login` and `logout` functions that use `signIn` and `signOut` from the `auth` module. The changes mostly involved small formatting and the addition of the `use server` directive.

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file, updated at 6:46 PM, defines the database schema, modeling `User`, `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken`, `Trip`, and `Location` entities.  This defines the database structure for the application.


The `.env` file was updated at 7:00PM adding `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to the file.

The `.env.local` file was updated multiple times (10:09 PM, 10:12 PM, 10:29 PM, 10:31 PM, and 10:48 PM), adding and modifying environment variables, primarily `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH_SECRET`, and finally  `NEXTAUTH_URL`.

The `test.ts` file was used to verify environment variables.

The `tsconfig.json` file was updated slightly at 10:38 PM, removing `../auth.ts` from the include array.

In summary, the log showcases a well-structured development process, iteratively building features from basic styling and layout to user authentication and database interaction. The use of environment variables for configuration and consistent updates to the `Navbar` component are notable aspects. The application makes use of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and NextAuth.js.
