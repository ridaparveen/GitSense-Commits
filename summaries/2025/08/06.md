The log shows multiple revisions to several files between August 5th and 6th, 2025.  The most significant changes involve the `vendor-columns.tsx` file, which defines columns for data tables displayed in the application.

**`vendor-columns.tsx` (August 5th, 2025):**  This file underwent numerous revisions, primarily focusing on the `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn` and `AlertMappingColumn` arrays.  Changes include:

* **4:18:41 PM:** Initial commit defining `GstDetailsColumn` and `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn`.
* **4:21:35 PM & 4:21:47 PM:**  Modifications to `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn`, adding a "Country" field and changing "Res.Address*" to "Address Line 1" and adding "Address Line 2". The "City" field was changed to a select input.
* **4:22:36 PM:** Further changes to `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn`, replacing "Res.Tel" with "Mobile" and adding a "Zipcode" field.
* **4:25:28 PM:** Introduction of `AlertMappingColumn`, mirroring the structure of `KeyPersonnalDetailsColumn` but with different field names (e.g., "Alerts", "Alert Type").
* **4:29:54 PM - 4:53:00 PM:** Several revisions adding type declarations to the column definitions and minor adjustments to field names and column widths.  The `AlertMappingColumn` was significantly reworked and refactored. Also there are added fields like "gst_valid_from" and "gst_exemption" in `GstDetailsColumn`.
* **4:51:12 PM & 4:51:42 PM:** More adjustments to column widths in `GstDetailsColumn` mainly to make it consistent.
* **4:45:00 PM & 4:45:39 PM:**  The `key` property was added consistently to all the column arrays. The `field` property was removed from `GstDetailsColumn`.
* **4:47:56 PM:** Changes to field names for better clarity (e.g., "Pin Code" to "Zip Code", "GST/UIN Status" to "GST/UIN Rejistration Status",  "Acknowledgement (ARN)" to "ARN").
* **4:49:56 PM:** Addition of `gst_valid_from` and `gst_exemption` fields to `GstDetailsColumn`.
* **4:51:12 PM:**  Minor width adjustments for consistency across columns.


**`AlertMapping.tsx` (August 5th, 2025):** This component uses the `AlertMappingColumn` from `vendor-columns.tsx` to render a dynamic editable table.  A simplification of the component was done by removing unused imports.

**`Fac.tsx` (August 5th and 6th, 2025):** This component renders a dynamic editable table using the `facDetailsColumn` from `vendor-columns.tsx`.  The code was simplified by removing some unnecessary components. A new column `facDetailsColumn` was added to `vendor-columns.tsx` and is used in this file.

**`GstRejistrtaionDetails.tsx` (August 5th and 6th, 2025):** This component renders a dynamic editable table for GST registration details using `GstDetailsColumn` from `vendor-columns.tsx`.

**`CreditControl.tsx` (August 5th, 2025):**  This component contains a series of collapsible sections for credit control settings. Multiple edits focused on the UI presentation, specifically changing `h2` tags to the proper `Label` and correcting minor styling issues,  and adjusting the layout of the form fields.


**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` (August 5th, 2025):** This component is a form for customer details, using `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components. The component was refactored from using MUI Grid to using Tailwind CSS Grid.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (August 6th, 2025):** This component shows overview statistics. The code was changed to display icons from config data, using a dynamic approach. The navigation link for adding a new vessel was changed to the correct path.

**`data.ts` (August 6th, 2025):** Updates to the `vesselData` array in this configuration file.  Changes include using specific color codes and replacing the percentage change display with a `Badge` component for visual clarity. The color coding of the badges were changed to indicate positive and negative changes. The icon display method was changed to use the icon component from the `OverviewItem` interface.


**`vessel-dashboard-columns.tsx` (August 6th, 2025):** This file defines columns for a vessel dashboard.

**`VesselDashboard.tsx` (August 6th, 2025):** This component renders a vessel dashboard using the `AppGrid` component.  Significant refactoring occurred, transitioning from MUI to the `AppGrid` component,  enhancing searchability and filtering, and adding export functionality. Multiple revisions focused on refining the filter options, data filtering logic, and overall UI enhancements.

**`vessel.types.ts` (August 6th, 2025):** Definition of types used in the vessel components.

**`VesselDetailsPage.tsx` (August 6th, 2025):**  This component renders a form for adding new vessels. Changes include a refactoring of the page layout using the `PageWrapper` component.  A back button and a select box for status were added to the page. The navigation links were corrected and the component imports changed to improve the code.

In summary, the major changes involved improvements to data table rendering,  UI refinements, and the introduction of filtering and export features in the Vessel Dashboard component. There was also a consistent effort in refactoring components to use Tailwind CSS for styling instead of Material UI. The majority of the changes were completed within a short time frame on August 5th, 2025, focusing on `vendor-columns.tsx` and related components.  On August 6th, the focus shifted to the vessel-related components, improving their functionality and styling.
