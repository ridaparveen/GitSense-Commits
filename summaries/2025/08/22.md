# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:57:06 AM
The log shows development on a React application, focusing on auto-search functionality, customer details forms, and an enquiry dashboard.

**`UseAutoSearch.tsx`**: This component was modified multiple times between 10:34 AM and 10:42 AM.  The core functionality involves fetching options from a backend API (`fetchOptions`) based on user input (query and field).  The changes primarily involved refining the import path of `fetchOptions` from  `@/api/fetchOptions` to `store/api/fetchOptionsApi` and updating the console log messages from  `Global Value Changed` and `Global Selection` to  `Value Changed` and `Value Selection` respectively.  The interface `AutoSearchResult` remained consistent throughout these updates.


**`fetchOptionsApi.ts`**: A single update at 10:35 AM created this file, which contains a simple API call to `/api/autosearch` to retrieve auto-search options.

**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`**: This component, updated at 10:41 AM and 10:44 AM, is a form for managing customer details.  It uses Formik for form management, integrates an auto-complete component (`AutocompleteBox`) leveraging `useAutoSearch`, and handles navigation to a GST location page (`/app/master/customer/gst-location`). The changes between the two timestamps were minimal and only involved cosmetic changes to the code.  The structure and functionality of the form remained largely unchanged.

**`AddHblParties.tsx`**:  Updated once at 10:45 AM, this component is a form for adding House Bill of Lading (HBL) parties.  It utilizes Formik, a multi-select box for party types, and input fields for various party details.  The most significant change here was replacing `./CustomeBroker` with `./AdditionalConfiguration`.


**`AdditionalConfiguration.tsx`**: Created at 10:46 AM, this component provides additional configuration options, including custom broker and bond holder selection using `AutocompleteBox` and a table to display and delete broker data.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx`**: Created at 10:46 AM.  This component renders an overview using data from `MBLData` and includes a modal (`BaseModal`) to open `VessalVoyageDetailsForm`.

**`VessalVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`**: Created at 10:47 AM, this form is for entering vessel and voyage details. It employs Formik and handles navigation to `"/app/import/mbl/addNewMblForm"`.

**`EnquiryDashboard.tsx`**: Updated twice at 10:52 AM and 10:53 AM. This component renders an enquiry dashboard with a collapsible table (`CollapsibleTable`), filtering, search, and export functionality. The updates involved a minor change in the `filterConfig` for the "Date Range" filter's "to" field.  The core functionality (filtering, searching, data updating, and Excel export) remained the same.


In summary, the code changes reflect the development of several interconnected components for a frontend application. The most significant updates relate to the implementation of dynamic auto-completion (`UseAutoSearch`), form creation (`CustomerDetailsForm`, `AddHblParties`, `VessalVoyageDetailsForm`), and the setup of an interactive enquiry dashboard (`EnquiryDashboard`).  There's a clear pattern of using Formik for form handling and custom UI components throughout the codebase.
