# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:57:06 AM
The log shows development on a React application, focusing on auto-search functionality, customer details forms, and an enquiry dashboard.

**`UseAutoSearch.tsx`**: This component was modified multiple times between 10:34 AM and 10:42 AM.  The core functionality involves fetching options from a backend API (`fetchOptions`) based on user input (query and field).  The changes primarily involved refining the import path of `fetchOptions` from  `@/api/fetchOptions` to `store/api/fetchOptionsApi` and updating the console log messages from  `Global Value Changed` and `Global Selection` to  `Value Changed` and `Value Selection` respectively.  The interface `AutoSearchResult` remained consistent throughout these updates.


**`fetchOptionsApi.ts`**: A single update at 10:35 AM created this file, which contains a simple API call to `/api/autosearch` to retrieve auto-search options.

**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`**: This component, updated at 10:41 AM and 10:44 AM, is a form for managing customer details.  It uses Formik for form management, integrates an auto-complete component (`AutocompleteBox`) leveraging `useAutoSearch`, and handles navigation to a GST location page (`/app/master/customer/gst-location`). The changes between the two timestamps were minimal and only involved cosmetic changes to the code.  The structure and functionality of the form remained largely unchanged.

**`AddHblParties.tsx`**:  Updated once at 10:45 AM, this component is a form for adding House Bill of Lading (HBL) parties.  It utilizes Formik, a multi-select box for party types, and input fields for various party details.  The most significant change here was replacing `./CustomeBroker` with `./AdditionalConfiguration`.


**`AdditionalConfiguration.tsx`**: Created at 10:46 AM, this component provides additional configuration options, including custom broker and bond holder selection using `AutocompleteBox` and a table to display and delete broker data.

**`OverviewContainer.tsx`**: Created at 10:46 AM.  This component renders an overview using data from `MBLData` and includes a modal (`BaseModal`) to open `VessalVoyageDetailsForm`.

**`VessalVoyageDetailsForm.tsx`**: Created at 10:47 AM, this form is for entering vessel and voyage details. It employs Formik and handles navigation to `"/app/import/mbl/addNewMblForm"`.

**`EnquiryDashboard.tsx`**: Updated twice at 10:52 AM and 10:53 AM. This component renders an enquiry dashboard with a collapsible table (`CollapsibleTable`), filtering, search, and export functionality. The updates involved a minor change in the `filterConfig` for the "Date Range" filter's "to" field.  The core functionality (filtering, searching, data updating, and Excel export) remained the same.


In summary, the code changes reflect the development of several interconnected components for a frontend application. The most significant updates relate to the implementation of dynamic auto-completion (`UseAutoSearch`), form creation (`CustomerDetailsForm`, `AddHblParties`, `VessalVoyageDetailsForm`), and the setup of an interactive enquiry dashboard (`EnquiryDashboard`).  There's a clear pattern of using Formik for form handling and custom UI components throughout the codebase.


## 11:57:03 AM
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within a React application.  The most significant changes are in `VesselDetailsForm.tsx` and `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`, both involving form components.

**`VesselDetailsForm.tsx` (8/22/2025, 11:24:46 AM and 8/22/2025, 11:25:39 AM):**  This component underwent a revision within a minute. The primary difference is the removal of an `AutocompleteBox` component for "Vessel Name". The initial version included an `AutocompleteBox` utilizing a custom `useAutoSearch` hook for handling options, while the second revision replaced it with a standard `InputBox`, simplifying the input mechanism.  Both versions use `formik` for form management and include various input fields (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`) for vessel details.


**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` (8/22/2025, 11:34:17 AM):** This component is a more extensive form for customer details. It uses `formik` for form handling, includes numerous input fields, `SelectBox` components, and `AutocompleteBox` components (some with static options, others appear to be dynamically populated).  The component handles navigation using `react-router-dom` and manages GST location data, allowing for adding or updating entries. The component leverages a custom `useAutoSearch` hook for handling autocomplete functionality, similar to `VesselDetailsForm.tsx`.


**`optionService.ts` (8/22/2025, 11:55:11 AM):** This file defines functions for fetching options, likely for use in the autocomplete components. It features a `fetchOptions` function to retrieve data from a backend API and a `getOptions` function that acts as a wrapper, providing fallback to static options if the API call fails.


**`AutocompleteBox.tsx` (8/22/2025, 11:56:42 AM):** This is a custom autocomplete component that uses the `getOptions` function from `optionService.ts`.  It handles dynamic option loading based on user input, displays loading indicators and provides error handling, highlighting, and keyboard navigation. The component uses `@heroicons/react` for styling.  The component's functionality significantly improved the user experience of selecting options in forms, especially those with a large number of options.

In summary, the code changes reflect the development and refinement of form components, emphasizing dynamic data loading for improved user experience and efficient form handling with `formik`. The `useAutoSearch` hook and custom `AutocompleteBox` component appear to be key elements in this effort.  The changes occurred within a short timeframe, suggesting a focused development session on form enhancements.
