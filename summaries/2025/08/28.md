# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 10:34:22 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\Calender.tsx` between 6:42 PM and 6:59 PM on August 26, 2025.  The core functionality of the Calendar component remains consistent throughout these changes; however, the visual presentation of the delivery mode selection, specifically within the `vessel` calendar type, undergoes several iterations.

Initially, a `<select>` element was used for delivery mode selection. This was subsequently replaced with a `<Dropdown>` component from a UI kit (`@components/kit/dropdown`).  Minor adjustments to the Dropdown's styling (specifically the `className`'s width `w-[200px]`, `w-[100px]`, `w-[120px]`, and `w-[160px]`) and the positioning of the `ChevronDownIcon` (`className="ml-6"`) occurred over several commits.  The final version uses `onClick` handlers within the DropdownItems instead of relying solely on the select's `onChange` event.  The Dropdown's button text is changed to dynamically display the `deliveryMode` or "Select Mode" if no mode is selected.

The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of refining the UI and improving the user experience of the delivery mode selection within the calendar.  There are no significant structural changes to the component's core logic or data handling.  The commented-out `<select>` element also shows an evolution from a native HTML element to a custom UI component.


## 11:39:05 AM
The log shows the creation of a new Node.js backend project, `envosys-backend`, on August 28th, 2025.  The project utilizes TypeScript and several npm packages.

The `README.md` file was created, containing only the project title.  The `package.json` file, created shortly after, defines project metadata, scripts for development (`dev`, `build`, `start`), and testing (`test`),  and lists dependencies including `express`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken` (likely for authentication), `pg` (PostgreSQL database driver), `multer` (for file uploads), `cors`, `dotenv`, and `winston` (for logging).  The `logger.ts` file implements a Winston logger, configuring it to output logs to the console (in development) and to various log files (error.log, combined.log, exceptions.log).  The `package-lock.json` file was generated automatically and contains the resolved dependencies tree.  Finally, a minor update occurred to the `README.md` file, adding a space after the project title.  All changes happened within a short time frame between 10:31 AM and 10:46 AM.


## 12:39:04 PM
The log shows development of an Express.js backend API, focusing on vessel-related functionalities.  The `Paths.ts` file defines API endpoints for users, authentication, and a master section encompassing customer, vessel, and vendor dashboards.  Significant changes occurred between 12:17 PM and 12:33 PM, involving the `vesselService.ts` file. Initially,  `vesselService.ts` contained empty `getVessel` and `saveVessel` functions.  These functions were progressively refined:  console logs were added for debugging, the module export style was changed from `export =` to `module.exports =` and then to  `export const`, and finally the `getVessel` function was updated to accept a request and response from express and return a JSON response.  The `VesselRoutes.ts` file underwent several revisions, initially containing commented-out code and later incorporating the updated `getVessel` service and correcting the route path from  `Paths.Master.Base` to `Paths.Master.GetVesselDashboard`. The `index.ts` file consistently routes to `/master` for vessel routes.  There are also multiple instances of minor formatting changes in  `VesselRoutes.ts` and `vesselService.ts`.  Notably, the `dashboardRoutes.ts` file shows a commented out implementation using the `Paths.Dashboard` object suggesting that initially dashboard functionality was being implemented there but was later refactored or moved.


## 1:39:05 PM
The log shows development of a backend service for fetching and potentially saving vessel data.  The `vesselService.ts` file underwent significant changes between 12:39 PM and 12:56 PM on August 28, 2025.

Initially, `vesselService.ts` contained only a `getVessel` function that returned a simple success message.  A `saveVessel` function was added shortly after (12:41 PM).  The code was refactored several times:  the `export` statement was changed to `export const`, and the functions were updated to use asynchronous operations with the database.

Between 12:50 PM and 12:56 PM, the database interaction was implemented using a PostgreSQL connection pool (`database.ts`).  This involved adding database query functions to `database.ts` and updating `vesselService.ts` to use `query` from `database.ts` to execute `SELECT * FROM vessel`.  The `getVessel` function was updated to return the actual vessel data instead of just a success message.  Finally, the response status code was set to 200 (OK) and custom type interfaces (`IReq`, `IRes`) were introduced in `vesselService.ts`.

The `VesselRoutes.ts` file (updated at 12:45 PM) defines a route using Express.js to handle GET requests for vessel dashboard data, linking it to the `getVessel` function in `vesselService.ts`.

A pattern is evident in the repeated use of `console.log("====get vessel data=====");` which might indicate a placeholder or debugging statement that should be removed or refined in later versions.  The `saveVessel` function currently duplicates the `getVessel` functionality and requires further implementation to perform actual saving.
