The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\Calender.tsx` between 6:42 PM and 6:59 PM on August 26, 2025.  The core functionality of the Calendar component remains consistent throughout these changes; however, the visual presentation of the delivery mode selection, specifically within the `vessel` calendar type, undergoes several iterations.

Initially, a `<select>` element was used for delivery mode selection. This was subsequently replaced with a `<Dropdown>` component from a UI kit (`@components/kit/dropdown`).  Minor adjustments to the Dropdown's styling (specifically the `className`'s width `w-[200px]`, `w-[100px]`, `w-[120px]`, and `w-[160px]`) and the positioning of the `ChevronDownIcon` (`className="ml-6"`) occurred over several commits.  The final version uses `onClick` handlers within the DropdownItems instead of relying solely on the select's `onChange` event.  The Dropdown's button text is changed to dynamically display the `deliveryMode` or "Select Mode" if no mode is selected.

The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of refining the UI and improving the user experience of the delivery mode selection within the calendar.  There are no significant structural changes to the component's core logic or data handling.  The commented-out `<select>` element also shows an evolution from a native HTML element to a custom UI component.
