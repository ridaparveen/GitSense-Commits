# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 10:34:22 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\Calender.tsx` between 6:42 PM and 6:59 PM on August 26, 2025.  The core functionality of the Calendar component remains consistent throughout these changes; however, the visual presentation of the delivery mode selection, specifically within the `vessel` calendar type, undergoes several iterations.

Initially, a `<select>` element was used for delivery mode selection. This was subsequently replaced with a `<Dropdown>` component from a UI kit (`@components/kit/dropdown`).  Minor adjustments to the Dropdown's styling (specifically the `className`'s width `w-[200px]`, `w-[100px]`, `w-[120px]`, and `w-[160px]`) and the positioning of the `ChevronDownIcon` (`className="ml-6"`) occurred over several commits.  The final version uses `onClick` handlers within the DropdownItems instead of relying solely on the select's `onChange` event.  The Dropdown's button text is changed to dynamically display the `deliveryMode` or "Select Mode" if no mode is selected.

The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of refining the UI and improving the user experience of the delivery mode selection within the calendar.  There are no significant structural changes to the component's core logic or data handling.  The commented-out `<select>` element also shows an evolution from a native HTML element to a custom UI component.


## 11:39:05 AM
The log shows the creation of a new Node.js backend project, `envosys-backend`, on August 28th, 2025.  The project utilizes TypeScript and several npm packages.

The `README.md` file was created, containing only the project title.  The `package.json` file, created shortly after, defines project metadata, scripts for development (`dev`, `build`, `start`), and testing (`test`),  and lists dependencies including `express`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken` (likely for authentication), `pg` (PostgreSQL database driver), `multer` (for file uploads), `cors`, `dotenv`, and `winston` (for logging).  The `logger.ts` file implements a Winston logger, configuring it to output logs to the console (in development) and to various log files (error.log, combined.log, exceptions.log).  The `package-lock.json` file was generated automatically and contains the resolved dependencies tree.  Finally, a minor update occurred to the `README.md` file, adding a space after the project title.  All changes happened within a short time frame between 10:31 AM and 10:46 AM.


## 12:39:04 PM
The log shows development of an Express.js backend API, focusing on vessel-related functionalities.  The `Paths.ts` file defines API endpoints for users, authentication, and a master section encompassing customer, vessel, and vendor dashboards.  Significant changes occurred between 12:17 PM and 12:33 PM, involving the `vesselService.ts` file. Initially,  `vesselService.ts` contained empty `getVessel` and `saveVessel` functions.  These functions were progressively refined:  console logs were added for debugging, the module export style was changed from `export =` to `module.exports =` and then to  `export const`, and finally the `getVessel` function was updated to accept a request and response from express and return a JSON response.  The `VesselRoutes.ts` file underwent several revisions, initially containing commented-out code and later incorporating the updated `getVessel` service and correcting the route path from  `Paths.Master.Base` to `Paths.Master.GetVesselDashboard`. The `index.ts` file consistently routes to `/master` for vessel routes.  There are also multiple instances of minor formatting changes in  `VesselRoutes.ts` and `vesselService.ts`.  Notably, the `dashboardRoutes.ts` file shows a commented out implementation using the `Paths.Dashboard` object suggesting that initially dashboard functionality was being implemented there but was later refactored or moved.


## 1:39:05 PM
The log shows development of a backend service for fetching and potentially saving vessel data.  The `vesselService.ts` file underwent significant changes between 12:39 PM and 12:56 PM on August 28, 2025.

Initially, `vesselService.ts` contained only a `getVessel` function that returned a simple success message.  A `saveVessel` function was added shortly after (12:41 PM).  The code was refactored several times:  the `export` statement was changed to `export const`, and the functions were updated to use asynchronous operations with the database.

Between 12:50 PM and 12:56 PM, the database interaction was implemented using a PostgreSQL connection pool (`database.ts`).  This involved adding database query functions to `database.ts` and updating `vesselService.ts` to use `query` from `database.ts` to execute `SELECT * FROM vessel`.  The `getVessel` function was updated to return the actual vessel data instead of just a success message.  Finally, the response status code was set to 200 (OK) and custom type interfaces (`IReq`, `IRes`) were introduced in `vesselService.ts`.

The `VesselRoutes.ts` file (updated at 12:45 PM) defines a route using Express.js to handle GET requests for vessel dashboard data, linking it to the `getVessel` function in `vesselService.ts`.

A pattern is evident in the repeated use of `console.log("====get vessel data=====");` which might indicate a placeholder or debugging statement that should be removed or refined in later versions.  The `saveVessel` function currently duplicates the `getVessel` functionality and requires further implementation to perform actual saving.


## 2:01:21 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `dashboardService.ts` file between 1:32 PM and 1:54 PM on August 28, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `getDeliveryData` function.  This function retrieves shipment data based on  `type` ("delivery" or "vessel") and `mode` (various delivery types: "ALL", "Door Delivery", "Port Delivery", "Rail Delivery").

The initial version of `getDeliveryData` included a `vessalFilter` condition within the `SqlQueryVesselArrival` query.  Subsequent revisions modified the `vessalFilter` logic to handle different delivery modes more precisely.  Specifically, the handling of "Rail Delivery," "Door Delivery," and "Port Delivery" modes was adjusted to create more specific filtering criteria within the `vessalFilter` variable, often excluding rail deliveries in certain cases and prioritizing the "Rail Delivery" condition in the if statement.  The  `AND inland_rail_move = 'Yes'` condition within the "Rail Delivery" mode was also changed in between versions.  These changes aim to improve the accuracy of data retrieval based on selected delivery modes.

The `getDashboardCardInfo` function, which retrieves dashboard card information using complex SQL queries, remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.  It consistently uses `FILTER` clauses in its SQL query to count and sum shipment data based on different shipment statuses (Pending Departure, In Transit, ETA within 1 week, Out for delivery), and it includes date range filtering based on user input (`fromDate`, `toDate`).


## 2:15:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `dashboard-page.tsx` between 1:26 PM and 1:59 PM on August 28, 2025, focusing on refinements to the `determineDeliveryMode` function within the `useMemo` hook.  The primary changes involve adjusting the logic for determining delivery modes ("Door Delivery," "Port Delivery," "Rail Delivery"). Initially,  "Rail Delivery" was given priority only if the `inland_rail_move` was "Yes". Later revisions prioritized "Rail Delivery" under a more complex condition and, in subsequent changes, simplified the conditions again.  The final version prioritized "Rail Delivery" if `inland_rail_move` is 'Yes', otherwise "Door Delivery" if specific conditions are met, and "Port Delivery" otherwise.

Additionally, a `hideUpChevron` prop was added to the `OptionBox` component at 2:14 PM, and the `Select` component was updated at 2:15 PM to conditionally render the up chevron based on this prop.  Finally, a change to `global.ts` at 2:04 PM modified the color associated with the "Loading" shipment status in `SHIPMENT_STATUS` from "indigo" to "red".


## 3:15:49 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\Calender.tsx` between 2:52 PM and 3:12 PM on August 28, 2025.  The core functionality of the Calendar component remains consistent throughout â€“ displaying a calendar view of deliveries, allowing navigation between dates, and filtering by delivery mode.  The changes primarily focus on styling and positioning elements within the calendar.

Specifically, the edits repeatedly adjust the positioning of the colored dot badge displayed next to each delivery item.  Its position shifts from `top-1 right-1`, `top-3 right-1`, `top-3 left-1`, `top-3 right-2`, `top-3 right-8`, `top-3 left-20`, `top-3 left-30`, `top-3 right-1`,  `top-8 right-1` and finally `top-3 right-1` again, indicating an ongoing effort to find the optimal visual placement.  Additionally, there's a change from `mt-1 pr-4` to `mt-1` and `mt-2 pr-4` in the `mblno` div styling, affecting the top margin and right padding.  Finally, the `max-h` property of the scrollable content area briefly changes from 300px to 350px and back to 300px.


The most significant change is introduced at 3:03:40 PM, where the colored dot's style is changed to a smaller size (`w-[6px] h-[6px]`) and moved to the top-left corner, this style change was then refined in subsequent commits to achieve optimal placement and styling. The addition of `break-words` and `break-all` to the `mblno` div at 3:05:58 PM and subsequent commits addresses potential line wrapping issues for longer MBL numbers, improving readability.  The final adjustments, around 3:12 PM, seem to finalize the styling with the colored dot next to the MBL number.


## 4:20:12 PM
The log shows changes primarily focused on `ApiMethods.js` and `ApiMethods.ts`,  files defining API interaction methods.  The initial versions (3:25 PM) of both files are nearly identical,  defining a class `ApiMethods` with methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. These methods use `fetch` and construct headers including authorization (using a token from `localStorage`) and content type.  A crucial aspect is the use of `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` to dynamically set the API base URL.

A minor revision to `ApiMethods.ts` occurred at 3:27 PM, seemingly without code changes based on the log.  However, `ApiMethods.js` underwent a significant change at 3:33 PM. This revision simplifies the `getAppHeaders` function, removing the optional `contentType` parameter and conditional logic for handling null authorization values, directly setting the Authorization header with the token.  This suggests a simplification or refactoring of the API request header handling.  All changes happened within a short time frame (approximately 39 minutes) on August 28, 2025.


## 4:43:38 PM
The log shows modifications to the `vessel.ts` and `vesselService.ts` files within the `envosys-backend` project.  The `vessel.ts` file, modified twice at approximately 4:30 PM on August 28th, 2025, primarily defines the `VesselQueryType` interface, which is used for querying vessel data. A `VesselStatus` enum was added later at 4:36 PM, containing status values "ALL", "ACTIVE", and "INACTIVE".

The `vesselService.ts` file undergoes several changes between 4:32 PM and 4:42 PM on August 28th, 2025.  The core change involves the creation and refinement of a `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class. This class constructs SQL queries for retrieving and counting vessel data, supporting features like pagination (`page`, `perPage`), sorting (`orderBy`), filtering (`addFilterClause`), searching (`addSearchClause`), and date range selection (`setDateRange`). The queries are built to interact with a `vessel` table in a database.  The `getVessel` function uses this query builder to fetch data, handling both successful responses (status code 200) and errors (status code 500). The `saveVessel` function appears to fetch all data from the `vessel` table, regardless of input.  There's a notable shift in the `getVessel` function from using `abe.booking_status` for filtering to `vs.vessel_name` and `vs.line_name` around 4:39 PM.  Finally, at 4:42 PM the default `page` value in the `getVessel` function is changed from 1 to 2.  The `options` part of the response was removed as well.  Throughout the edits of `vesselService.ts`, there are commented-out sections that suggest earlier iterations involving user roles and potentially different table names (`abe` instead of `vs`).  The use of `ILIKE` suggests a PostgreSQL database is used.
