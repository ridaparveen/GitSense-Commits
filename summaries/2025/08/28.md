# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 10:34:22 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\common\Calender.tsx` between 6:42 PM and 6:59 PM on August 26, 2025.  The core functionality of the Calendar component remains consistent throughout these changes; however, the visual presentation of the delivery mode selection, specifically within the `vessel` calendar type, undergoes several iterations.

Initially, a `<select>` element was used for delivery mode selection. This was subsequently replaced with a `<Dropdown>` component from a UI kit (`@components/kit/dropdown`).  Minor adjustments to the Dropdown's styling (specifically the `className`'s width `w-[200px]`, `w-[100px]`, `w-[120px]`, and `w-[160px]`) and the positioning of the `ChevronDownIcon` (`className="ml-6"`) occurred over several commits.  The final version uses `onClick` handlers within the DropdownItems instead of relying solely on the select's `onChange` event.  The Dropdown's button text is changed to dynamically display the `deliveryMode` or "Select Mode" if no mode is selected.

The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of refining the UI and improving the user experience of the delivery mode selection within the calendar.  There are no significant structural changes to the component's core logic or data handling.  The commented-out `<select>` element also shows an evolution from a native HTML element to a custom UI component.

The log shows the creation of a new Node.js backend project, `envosys-backend`, on August 28th, 2025.  The project utilizes TypeScript and several npm packages.

The `README.md` file was created, containing only the project title.  The `package.json` file, created shortly after, defines project metadata, scripts for development (`dev`, `build`, `start`), and testing (`test`),  and lists dependencies including `express`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken` (likely for authentication), `pg` (PostgreSQL database driver), `multer` (for file uploads), `cors`, `dotenv`, and `winston` (for logging).  The `logger.ts` file implements a Winston logger, configuring it to output logs to the console (in development) and to various log files (error.log, combined.log, exceptions.log).  The `package-lock.json` file was generated automatically and contains the resolved dependencies tree.  Finally, a minor update occurred to the `README.md` file, adding a space after the project title.  All changes happened within a short time frame between 10:31 AM and 10:46 AM.
