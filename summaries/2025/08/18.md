# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 11:37:59 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `CollapsibleTable.tsx` and `EnquiryDashboard.tsx`.  The changes span approximately 45 minutes (10:23 AM to 11:08 AM).

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\common\CollapsibleTable.tsx`:**

This component, a collapsible table, underwent several minor updates between 10:23 AM and 10:26 AM.  These revisions appear to focus on styling adjustments (e.g., `typographySx`, `tableCellHeadSx`) and involved the color attributes of text elements. There were no significant functional changes to the core table functionality.  The `render` function within the `Column` interface was updated, suggesting improved rendering capabilities.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\enquiry\EnquiryDashboard.tsx`:**

This component, an enquiry dashboard, shows a more substantial evolution.  Changes started at 10:25 AM and continued until 10:57 AM.  The primary changes involved enhancing the UI with the addition of search and filtering capabilities, an Excel export function using `generateExcel`,  and styling updates using tailwind CSS classes.  A significant change was the introduction of a search bar and the implementation of client-side search filtering using `handleSearch`.  The `columns` array, defining table headers, was also modified multiple times. The most notable modification here was the addition of the `renderCell` prop in the "Enquiry" column, transforming the enquiry number from a simple text display to a clickable link (or button in later commits), likely for navigation purposes.  The icon for Agent Information was also updated from  `Info` from Material UI to `HiInformationCircle` from react-icons/hi at approximately 10:29 AM. Finally there were no changes made to functionality for nested detail rows update.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **Styling:**  Both files show repeated updates to styling attributes (`sx` props in `CollapsibleTable.tsx` and Tailwind CSS classes in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx`), indicating ongoing UI refinement.
* **Component Reusability:** `CollapsibleTable.tsx` is used in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx`, demonstrating a modular design approach.
* **Data Handling:**  `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` features functions for updating table rows (`updateRow`), suggesting dynamic data manipulation, while `CollapsibleTable.tsx` primarily manages the table's visual aspects and interactions.
* **UI Library:**  There is a mix of Material UI (`@mui/material`) and Tailwind CSS being used across both files for styling and UI components, reflecting a potentially hybrid approach to front-end development.

In short, the modifications demonstrate iterative development, with an emphasis on enhancing the usability and visual appeal of the enquiry dashboard (`EnquiryDashboard.tsx`) while making minor adjustments to the underlying collapsible table (`CollapsibleTable.tsx`) for improved functionality and consistency.  The later commits to `filter.tsx` focused on refactoring the filter component, replacing the input radio buttons and checkboxes with custom components (`Radio`, `RadioGroup`, `Checkbox`, `CheckboxGroup`) for better design consistency.  Finally a `Divider` component was added for improved UI layout.


## 12:37:58 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to several React components over a short period on August 18, 2025.  The primary focus is on `EnquiryDetailsForm.tsx` and `ShipperModelForm.tsx`.

`EnquiryDetailsForm.tsx` underwent numerous revisions, primarily involving the management of a modal (`BaseModal`) containing `ShipperModelForm`.  Initial versions had issues with the modal's open/close state and type handling.  The `onClick` handlers for the "Shipper Name" and "Consignee Name" input groups were refined to correctly set the modal type ("ship-info" or "con-info").  The final version establishes proper state management for the modal, enabling distinct forms for shipper and consignee information.  There's also consistently added functionality related to form submission using `useFormik`.

`ShipperModelForm.tsx` evolved significantly. Early versions had inconsistent or incorrect use of `formik`'s `values` prop access, leading to issues in correctly updating form fields.  Subsequent updates corrected these issues and refactored the component to receive `formik` prop, fixing the way it accesses formik's values and functions.  Finally, the component was enhanced with a functional `handleSubmit` and button changes from simple `onClick` to a submission logic with cancel and add buttons. The `onSubmitParty` prop facilitates updating either "shipper_name" or "consingee_name" in the parent `EnquiryDetailsForm` component.

`EnquiryForm.tsx` shows a single commit introducing a new component to create new enquiry forms. It uses `EnquiryDetailsForm` to handle the detailed form, providing initial values.

`MessageTab.tsx` shows addition of user mention feature in the message input box along with dummy user data.

`EnquiryDashboard.tsx` shows a React component for displaying and managing enquiry data. Key features include a collapsible table (`CollapsibleTable`), filtering (`FilterSidebar`), search functionality, and Excel export.  There's also basic CRUD operations in place.

`FacDetails.tsx` shows a component for displaying and editing financial details within a booking form using a dynamic editable table.  The primary changes involved refining the styling and spacing of the footer in the table.


The recurring pattern across all files is the extensive use of React components for UI elements, Formik for form management, and custom styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  The timestamps demonstrate rapid iterative development and debugging, particularly in the modal interactions.


## 2:17:37 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `BookingDetails.tsx` and `Tracker.tsx`.  The changes span a short period on August 18th, 2025, between 12:38 PM and 12:41 PM.

`BookingDetails.tsx` underwent two minor revisions within a few minutes. The changes primarily involved reordering elements in the UI.  Specifically, the order of "Booking No" and "Send Mail To" SelectBoxes was swapped in the third revision. No functional changes are apparent between revisions.

`Tracker.tsx` was updated once, at 12:41:54 PM.  This revision removed the `Divider` component from the import statement, suggesting a simplification of the component's UI.  No other functional changes are evident in the provided code snippets.  The `Tracker` component itself is a detailed step-by-step tracker with date/time pickers and input boxes for different tracking steps. The component supports both "view" and "edit" modes and uses custom step icons.  The `stepConfig` array defines the steps, including labels and keys. The `getStepContent` function dynamically renders the content for each step based on its index and data.


## 3:25:12 PM
The log shows extensive modifications across several React components and data structures related to an MBL (Master Bill of Lading) management system.  The changes span from August 18th, 2025, between approximately 2:18 PM and 3:04 PM.

**`SaleRateDetails.tsx` (2:18:29 PM):** This component was initially created, rendering a dynamic editable table for sale rate details using Formik. The table displays fields like "Charge Name," "Unit Type," "Unit Rate," and "Total Amount," with a footer summarizing the total amount.

**`MblDashboard.tsx` (2:22:01 PM, 2:54:08 PM, 2:54:19 PM):** This component, displaying an MBL list, underwent several revisions.  The most significant change involved switching from `ClientGrid` to `AppGrid` for rendering the MBL data (2:24:55 PM).  Subsequent updates focused on refining the filtering and sorting functionalities and removing commented-out code. The final update (2:54:19 PM) involved streamlining the code, likely for improved readability and maintainability.


**`mbl-coulmns.tsx` (2:23:49 PM, 2:36:29 PM, 2:36:41 PM, 2:37:04 PM, 2:37:16 PM, 2:37:46 PM, 2:38:29 PM):** This file defines the columns for the MBL dashboard.  Multiple rapid revisions adjusted the `headerAlign` property of the "MBL No." column from "center" to "left," indicating a design change or potential bug fix.  Further modifications removed unnecessary styling properties, like `align` and `cellType`, streamlining the code.


**`OverviewContainer.tsx` (2:40:19 PM):** This component was created, providing an overview of MBL data with summary cards.  It incorporates a time period filter and a button to add new MBLs.

**`MblDetailsForm.tsx` (2:41:53 PM, 2:42:03 PM, 2:42:39 PM, 2:42:46 PM, 2:45:24 PM):** This form for MBL details was added.  The major change was correcting the label of "HBL Date" to "MBL Date" (2:42:39 PM) and passing `formik` prop to the nested `HblListOfMbl` component. This indicates a likely refactoring for better data handling within the form.


**`MblDetailsPage.tsx` (2:46:55 PM, 2:48:26 PM):** This page displays the `MblDetailsForm`.  No significant code changes were observed beyond the initial creation and minor updates to accommodate the changes in `MblDetailsFormValue`.


**`mbl.types.ts` (2:47:07 PM, 2:47:21 PM, 2:48:15 PM):** This file defines the types for MBL data. The `hbl_list` property in `MblDetailsFormValue` was significantly altered, changing from `string` to `number` and finally to a dedicated `HblList` type containing a `Set<number>`.  This suggests a more robust approach to managing associated HBL (House Bill of Lading) data.


**`HblListOfMbl.tsx` (2:49:41 PM, 2:50:35 PM, 2:53:16 PM):** This component renders a list of HBLs associated with an MBL.  It uses a grid, includes actions for each HBL, and allows for selecting HBLs.  The change from `ClientGrid` to `AppGrid` (2:50:35 PM) is consistent with the changes made in `MblDashboard.tsx`. The final update (2:53:16 PM) focused on cleaning up the code and using a more consistent component (`AppGrid`).


**`App.tsx` (2:55:42 PM):** The main application routing was updated to include the newly added MBL-related components.


**`CartingDashboard.tsx` (2:57:50 PM, 2:59:32 PM, 3:01:34 PM, 3:02:30 PM, 3:02:50 PM, 3:03:41 PM, 3:03:51 PM, 3:04:35 PM):** This component, showing a carting list, underwent multiple revisions primarily focused on its filtering and data representation capabilities.  Several updates refined the filter options (especially the "consignee" filter appearing multiple times), status options, and code structure. The most significant change was simplifying the structure of the filter config.


**`carting-coulmns.tsx` (2:58:06 PM, 2:58:42 PM):**  This file defines the columns for the carting dashboard. It was modified to improve the status display using `AppChip` and adjusted some styling.



The overall pattern is one of iterative development and refinement.  The team appears to be building out the MBL and carting functionalities, repeatedly modifying components and data structures to improve their functionality, usability, and maintainability.  The frequent commits on `mbl-coulmns.tsx` and `CartingDashboard.tsx` suggest a focus on improving the user interface and data presentation.  The adoption of `AppGrid` across multiple components indicates a move towards a more unified and consistent grid implementation.


## 4:25:11 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the Envosys frontend codebase on August 18th, 2025, primarily focused on the line booking feature and related components.  Several files were updated repeatedly within a short timeframe, suggesting iterative development and debugging.

`line-booking-columns.tsx`: This file defines columns for data grids related to line bookings.  Initial versions included columns for status, booking number, date, POD, line name, customer name, CFS name, and actions.  Later versions added a `PLANNED_VESSEL_VOYAGE` constant for a planned vessel voyage selection grid,  and modifications were made to the `renderCell` functions within `LINE_BOOKING_DASHBOARD_COLUMNS`.  The most significant changes involved adding radio buttons to the `PLANNED_VESSEL_VOYAGE` grid for selecting a vessel voyage and  updating the function signature to include `setFormikFieldValue` for updating formik state.


`common.ts`: This file contains various constant arrays and objects used across the application.  These mainly consist of predefined options for things like tab data (enquiry, booking, HBL, and customer details), time period filters, sort options (for MBL, customer, and procurement), status options, unit options, and status mapping for different dashboard types (booking, MBL, line booking, and invoice).  No structural changes, just the initial definition of these constants.


`LineBookingDashboard.tsx`: This component renders the line booking dashboard. It uses a data grid (`AppGrid`) to display line booking data and includes features for searching, sorting, filtering, and exporting data to Excel.  The initial version was functional, with subsequent updates focused on implementing and refining filtering and sorting capabilities.


`LineBookingDetailsPage.tsx`: This page displays a form for adding or editing line booking details. No significant changes other than the initial creation of the page.


`line-booking.types.ts`:  This file defines TypeScript interfaces and types for line booking related data, including `LineBookingData`, `FilterState`, `Column`, `BookingInfo`, and `LineBookingFormValues`.  The initial version establishes the structure of line booking data, filter options, column structure, booking information, and values for the forms. Subsequent revisions did not make significant changes to the structure.


`LineBookingForm.tsx`: This component renders the line booking form. It uses Formik for form management and includes input fields for various booking details, a dynamic table (`DynamicEditableTable`) for cargo details, and a data grid (`AppGrid`) to select a planned vessel voyage. The majority of the updates here centered around fixing the `AppGrid` component and adding pagination to it, and handling formik field updates in response to grid selections.  This file went through several iterations to manage pagination and the proper update of Formik's internal state based on the user's selection of vessel voyages. The final version uses `pagination = {false}` to disable the pagination UI.


`datagrid.tsx`: This component is a styled data grid component.  The initial version rendered the data grid and implemented the pagination. Subsequent changes involved refining the styling and adding a conditional to show pagination only when the `pagination` prop is true.


`procurement-columns.tsx`: This file defines columns for a procurement dashboard data grid, similar in structure to `line-booking-columns.tsx`.  The changes refined the column definitions, adding `flex` properties for responsive layout and removing unnecessary `headerAlign` and `align` properties from the `action` column.


`ProcurementDashboard.tsx`: This component is similar to `LineBookingDashboard.tsx` but for procurement data. It was initially created in a complete and functional state with no structural changes made in subsequent commits.


`SvgIcon.tsx`: This file defines custom SVG icons, introducing a custom delete icon and a container icon. No changes were made to this file after its initial creation.


`data.ts`: This file defines data for various dashboard overview items.  The initial version includes data for dashboards related to enquiries, bookings, MBLs, customers, vessels, vendors, invoices, carting, line bookings, stuffing, procurement, and box plans. A key change was replacing an import path for `Vector` from `react-icons/bi` to  `../../public/Vector.png`.  The import of `BiVector`  was likely replaced due to image import needs. A further change was made to correct the import path for `ContainerIcon` to `../../public/Vector.png`.


## 5:27:37 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `data.ts` throughout the afternoon of August 18th, 2025, focusing on data visualization configuration.  The file defines numerous constant arrays (`dashboardData`, `bookingData`, `MBLData`, etc.), each containing objects of type `OverviewItem`.  These objects represent data points for various dashboard sections, specifying `title`, `value`, `changes` (representing change from a previous period), `bgColor`, `iconColor`, and an `icon` (either a React icon or a path to an image).

Initially,  `data.ts` used a mix of MUI and React icons. Later revisions, starting around 4:30 PM,  consolidated icon imports by consistently importing icons from the `../assets/images` folder for  `procurementData`.  The `./Vector.png` path was adjusted to `../assets/images/Vector.png`  for consistency.  Additional image imports (`VectorCostIcon`, `DeliveryRateIcon`, `CybleTimeIcon`) were added to `data.ts` around 4:49 PM, seemingly for  improving the visual representation of procurement data.  Between 4:50 PM and 4:51 PM, `LocalShippingIcon` was swapped for `LocalShippingTwoTone` in `procurementData`. This final change in `data.ts` was at 4:54 PM, removing commented-out import statements, cleaning up the imports section.


A separate file, `custom.d.ts`, was added at 4:41 PM, declaring modules for various image types (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, svg), likely to improve type checking in the project.


The `OverviewContainer.tsx` file, modified between 4:45 PM and 4:46 PM, displays the data from `procurementData`. The component renders a series of cards using Tailwind CSS styling and conditionally renders icons based on whether they're strings (image paths) or React components.  Minor formatting and spacing changes were also made to `OverviewContainer.tsx`.  No functional changes were made here.

Finally, a `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` component was added at 4:57 PM. This component uses Formik for managing form state and rendering a form with numerous input fields for customer details. The form submits data to the console (for logging purposes), and includes navigation elements.
