# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 10:47:51 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ShippingBillTable.tsx`, a React component responsible for displaying and managing a table of shipping bills.  The initial version (9:48:56 AM) utilized a custom table implementation with  `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components.  Subsequent changes (9:49:14 AM, 9:49:33 AM, 9:50:46 AM, 9:51:05 AM, 9:51:21 AM) involved refining the implementation by progressively switching from a custom table to the `@mui/x-data-grid` component for improved functionality and rendering.  The `InputBox` component remains,  but the overall structure is rewritten to utilize Material UI's data grid.


At 9:56:46 AM,  `AppGrid` is imported, suggesting a possible attempt to integrate it, or a transition back to  a custom solution using this component, although that seems abandoned in the following commits.  Between 10:01:34 AM and 10:39:57 AM, small styling adjustments are made within the `InputBox` components, specifically altering the padding and adding a border.


Finally, a significant change occurs at 10:45:32 AM. A `SelectBox` component is integrated for fields within new rows, introducing the ability to select options instead of only providing text input.  This represents a major functional enhancement, allowing for a more interactive and controlled user experience.  The code consistently uses functional components and hooks for state management, reflecting a modern React approach.  There is a consistent theme of adding and managing rows in the table, with functions like `handleAddRow` and `handleDeleteLast` appearing throughout the log.


## 1:55:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file on August 11th, 2025.  The file is a Node.js module that updates Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) data for ISF (likely International Ship and Facility) records.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions. The script retrieves ISF agent booking entries, checks for existing ETD/ETA values, fetches supplemental data from `mtr_tracking_data` based on the Master Bill of Lading number (MBL), and updates the `agent_booking_routing` table accordingly.  An audit log entry is created for each change via the `insertAudit` function.

The changes between revisions are minor and focused on logging:

* **1:19:45 PM:** The initial revision includes a comprehensive logging strategy, showing updates and failures.  It logs individual field updates (ETD and ETA) separately.

* **1:23:35 PM - 1:24:21 PM:** Subsequent revisions remove a comment indicating that it will log all updated fields and the `else` block related to no changes made. The script now only logs the fields that were actually updated.  The overall logic and functionality remain unchanged.  The timestamps indicate rapid iteration and refinement of the logging mechanism.

The script uses a PostgreSQL database (`pool`) and the `gmailSender.utils` module to send error notifications.  There is a noticeable pattern of comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the code.


## 4:46:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `shipmentService.ts` file between 4:23 PM and 4:41 PM on August 11, 2025, and a change to `shipment.ts` at 4:41 PM on the same day.  The core functionality of `shipmentService.ts` involves retrieving shipment data based on various filters.

**`shipmentService.ts` Changes:**

The primary changes revolve around refining the filtering and data retrieval logic within the `getAll` function.  Specifically:

* **Improved Filtering:** The code was modified to handle multiple status filters passed as comma-separated strings or arrays.  A `SqlQueryBuilder` class was used to construct and manage the database queries, enhancing readability and maintainability.  Additional filters were introduced for container number (`contno`).


* **Shipment Status Logic:** The logic for determining shipment status based on MTR (likely Master Tracking Record) data was significantly improved.  The code now uses a more robust set of conditions to determine the correct status ("Pending", "Loading", "Departed", "In_Transit", "Custom_Hold", "Arrived", "Delivered"), considering various date fields from the MTR data.  A previous, more complex, check using `shipmentScope` was removed, simplifying the status determination.


* **Data Enrichment:** The `getAll` function now enriches the retrieved shipment data by adding `eta`, `etd`, `ata`, and `atd` fields from the MTR data, supplementing the existing data.  The `pol` and `pod` fields are also updated with values from MTR if available, correcting inconsistencies.

* **Minor Bug Fixes:**  There were a few minor changes in how parameter placeholders (`$$`) were handled in the `SqlQueryBuilder` class, correcting index management within the `addCondition` and `buildFilterConditions` methods, particularly regarding the handling of the `contno` filter.


**`shipment.ts` Changes:**

The `shipment.ts` file was updated to include a new field, `contno`, in the `ShipmentQueryParams` and `QueryFilters` interfaces. This allows filtering shipments by container number.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for database interactions.
* Extensive use of logging (`logger.info`) for debugging and monitoring.
* Reliance on moment.js for date manipulation.
* Use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The changes suggest an iterative refinement of the shipment data retrieval process, improving accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.  The most significant changes are related to the status determination logic and the addition of filtering for container number.
