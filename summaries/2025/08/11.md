# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 10:47:51 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ShippingBillTable.tsx`, a React component responsible for displaying and managing a table of shipping bills.  The initial version (9:48:56 AM) utilized a custom table implementation with  `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components.  Subsequent changes (9:49:14 AM, 9:49:33 AM, 9:50:46 AM, 9:51:05 AM, 9:51:21 AM) involved refining the implementation by progressively switching from a custom table to the `@mui/x-data-grid` component for improved functionality and rendering.  The `InputBox` component remains,  but the overall structure is rewritten to utilize Material UI's data grid.


At 9:56:46 AM,  `AppGrid` is imported, suggesting a possible attempt to integrate it, or a transition back to  a custom solution using this component, although that seems abandoned in the following commits.  Between 10:01:34 AM and 10:39:57 AM, small styling adjustments are made within the `InputBox` components, specifically altering the padding and adding a border.


Finally, a significant change occurs at 10:45:32 AM. A `SelectBox` component is integrated for fields within new rows, introducing the ability to select options instead of only providing text input.  This represents a major functional enhancement, allowing for a more interactive and controlled user experience.  The code consistently uses functional components and hooks for state management, reflecting a modern React approach.  There is a consistent theme of adding and managing rows in the table, with functions like `handleAddRow` and `handleDeleteLast` appearing throughout the log.
