# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 10:47:51 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ShippingBillTable.tsx`, a React component responsible for displaying and managing a table of shipping bills.  The initial version (9:48:56 AM) utilized a custom table implementation with  `InputBox` and `SelectBox` components.  Subsequent changes (9:49:14 AM, 9:49:33 AM, 9:50:46 AM, 9:51:05 AM, 9:51:21 AM) involved refining the implementation by progressively switching from a custom table to the `@mui/x-data-grid` component for improved functionality and rendering.  The `InputBox` component remains,  but the overall structure is rewritten to utilize Material UI's data grid.


At 9:56:46 AM,  `AppGrid` is imported, suggesting a possible attempt to integrate it, or a transition back to  a custom solution using this component, although that seems abandoned in the following commits.  Between 10:01:34 AM and 10:39:57 AM, small styling adjustments are made within the `InputBox` components, specifically altering the padding and adding a border.


Finally, a significant change occurs at 10:45:32 AM. A `SelectBox` component is integrated for fields within new rows, introducing the ability to select options instead of only providing text input.  This represents a major functional enhancement, allowing for a more interactive and controlled user experience.  The code consistently uses functional components and hooks for state management, reflecting a modern React approach.  There is a consistent theme of adding and managing rows in the table, with functions like `handleAddRow` and `handleDeleteLast` appearing throughout the log.


## 1:55:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file on August 11th, 2025.  The file is a Node.js module that updates Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) data for ISF (likely International Ship and Facility) records.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions. The script retrieves ISF agent booking entries, checks for existing ETD/ETA values, fetches supplemental data from `mtr_tracking_data` based on the Master Bill of Lading number (MBL), and updates the `agent_booking_routing` table accordingly.  An audit log entry is created for each change via the `insertAudit` function.

The changes between revisions are minor and focused on logging:

* **1:19:45 PM:** The initial revision includes a comprehensive logging strategy, showing updates and failures.  It logs individual field updates (ETD and ETA) separately.

* **1:23:35 PM - 1:24:21 PM:** Subsequent revisions remove a comment indicating that it will log all updated fields and the `else` block related to no changes made. The script now only logs the fields that were actually updated.  The overall logic and functionality remain unchanged.  The timestamps indicate rapid iteration and refinement of the logging mechanism.

The script uses a PostgreSQL database (`pool`) and the `gmailSender.utils` module to send error notifications.  There is a noticeable pattern of comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the code.


## 4:46:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `shipmentService.ts` file between 4:23 PM and 4:41 PM on August 11, 2025, and a change to `shipment.ts` at 4:41 PM on the same day.  The core functionality of `shipmentService.ts` involves retrieving shipment data based on various filters.

**`shipmentService.ts` Changes:**

The primary changes revolve around refining the filtering and data retrieval logic within the `getAll` function.  Specifically:

* **Improved Filtering:** The code was modified to handle multiple status filters passed as comma-separated strings or arrays.  A `SqlQueryBuilder` class was used to construct and manage the database queries, enhancing readability and maintainability.  Additional filters were introduced for container number (`contno`).


* **Shipment Status Logic:** The logic for determining shipment status based on MTR (likely Master Tracking Record) data was significantly improved.  The code now uses a more robust set of conditions to determine the correct status ("Pending", "Loading", "Departed", "In_Transit", "Custom_Hold", "Arrived", "Delivered"), considering various date fields from the MTR data.  A previous, more complex, check using `shipmentScope` was removed, simplifying the status determination.


* **Data Enrichment:** The `getAll` function now enriches the retrieved shipment data by adding `eta`, `etd`, `ata`, and `atd` fields from the MTR data, supplementing the existing data.  The `pol` and `pod` fields are also updated with values from MTR if available, correcting inconsistencies.

* **Minor Bug Fixes:**  There were a few minor changes in how parameter placeholders (`$$`) were handled in the `SqlQueryBuilder` class, correcting index management within the `addCondition` and `buildFilterConditions` methods, particularly regarding the handling of the `contno` filter.


**`shipment.ts` Changes:**

The `shipment.ts` file was updated to include a new field, `contno`, in the `ShipmentQueryParams` and `QueryFilters` interfaces. This allows filtering shipments by container number.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for database interactions.
* Extensive use of logging (`logger.info`) for debugging and monitoring.
* Reliance on moment.js for date manipulation.
* Use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The changes suggest an iterative refinement of the shipment data retrieval process, improving accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.  The most significant changes are related to the status determination logic and the addition of filtering for container number.


## 4:47:11 PM
The provided log shows a series of modifications to the `shipment-container-page.tsx` file between 3:59 PM and 4:18 PM on August 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the user interface and functionality related to shipment data display and filtering.


**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\shipment-container-page.tsx`**

The `shipment-container-page.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions.  Early revisions involved significant restructuring of the UI.  Initially, the page displayed shipment data in a card format showing  "Average Port to Port Transit Time" and "Shipment In Transit", both with progress bars and growth indicators.  Later revisions removed these cards in favor of a more streamlined design featuring  `AppGrid` for displaying shipment data and a `FilterSidebar`.

The changes between 4:01 PM and 4:10 PM involved moving the Autocomplete boxes for "Port of Loading" and "Port of Discharge" from commented-out sections to the active UI. The "Filter" button was also added for better filter management.  Styling adjustments were made throughout, primarily adding or changing classes related to spacing (`gap`, `mb`), width (`w-full`, `w-[300px]`, `w-[40%]`), and height (`h-[36px]`, `py-4`).  The page title was changed from "Container View" to "Containers" and  the header for "Active Shipments" was improved. One notable change around 4:06 PM removed the initial card display entirely.  A `className="w-[300px]"`, was added to `AutocompleteBox` and `Button` components around 4:07 PM for improved width control.


**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\data\coulmns\shipment-coulmns.tsx`**

The `shipment-coulmns.tsx` file was updated at 4:14 PM and 4:20 PM on August 11, 2025. The changes were focused on improving the "Action" column in the displayed grid.  The link in the "Action" column of the `useShipmentContainersCoulmns` function was changed from `details/?mblno=${params.row.mblno}` to `/app/shipments/details/?mblno=${params.row.mblno}`. This suggests a routing change or the addition of a base path for shipment details. Additionally, the button text was changed from "Track" to "View."


**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\fretures\shipment-dashboard-slice.ts`**

The `shipment-dashboard-slice.ts` file was updated at 4:22 PM on August 11, 2025. This file manages Redux state for the shipment dashboard.  No significant structural changes were made but the reducer now includes actions for setting date range and period, indicating improved date-based filtering capabilities.


In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative process of UI refinement and enhanced filtering capabilities within the shipment container page. The most significant changes occurred between 4:01 PM and 4:10 PM, with the final UI structure solidifying  after 4:10 PM.  The changes to `shipment-coulmns.tsx` suggest a change to the URL structure for shipment details.  The `shipment-dashboard-slice.ts` update indicates improved date filtering in the Redux store.


## 5:47:03 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `pagination.tsx` component and one revision to `datagrid.tsx` and `shipment-container-page.tsx`.

**`datagrid.tsx` (8/11/2025, 4:55:05 PM):** This file defines a styled data grid component (`StyledDataGrid`, `StyledDataGridPro`) using MUI's `DataGrid` and `DataGridPro`.  It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and introduces custom pagination (`CustomFooterComponent`). The component receives props for columns, data, pagination, sorting, and loading state, allowing for server-side pagination and sorting.

**`shipment-container-page.tsx` (8/11/2025, 4:55:37 PM):** This component renders a page displaying shipment container data using the `AppGrid` component. It fetches data using custom hooks (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery`, `useFetchShipmentCardDataQuery`) and Redux for state management (actions like `dashboardSetFilters`, `dashboardSetPagination`, `dashboardSetSortModel`). The page includes filters, an autocomplete component (`AutocompleteBox`), and handles pagination and sorting via the data grid.

**`pagination.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):**  This file contains multiple revisions of a custom pagination component (`CustomNewPagination`). The initial version (4:58:34 PM) and subsequent versions show many iterative changes to the pagination logic and UI.  Key changes include:

* **Pagination algorithm improvements:** Several revisions attempted to improve the logic for displaying page numbers, particularly when the total number of pages is large.  Early versions displayed all pages or a small window around the current page. Later versions added logic to show the first few pages, the last few pages and a gap in between to indicate that not all pages are being displayed. The optimal algorithm was not settled upon after several iterations, reverting to a simple implementation in the final versions.
* **"No records found" message:** A check was added to display "No records found" if `rowCount` is 0.
* **UI adjustments:** Minor changes to the layout and styling (e.g., removing `gap-4` in one revision, adding `w-[40%]` to the pagination element, adding a `div` wrapper for the pagination controls and page size selector).
* **Page size change:** The final versions changed how page size affects the page number, resetting to page 0 (first page) when the page size is updated.

The changes to `pagination.tsx` show an iterative development process, focusing on refining the pagination algorithm and the user interface to enhance user experience. The final version uses a simple pagination algorithm, prioritizing clarity.  No significant functional changes were added after the first version.  The multiple revisions of `pagination.tsx` strongly suggest that this is an area receiving significant attention from the developer.


## 6:46:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `dashboardService.ts` file between 5:54 PM and 6:11 PM on August 11, 2025.  The file contains two main functions: `getDashboardCardInfo` and `getDeliveryData`.

`getDashboardCardInfo` retrieves dashboard card information using a SQL query against the `mtr_tracking_data` table. This query uses `COUNT(*) FILTER` to calculate four counts: pending departure, in transit, ETA within one week, and out for delivery.  The query is dynamically built based on user input (`fromDate`, `toDate`) and user authorization (`req.user`), leveraging the `buildMtrUserCondition` function. The core logic and query structure remain consistent across all revisions.

`getDeliveryData` fetches delivery or vessel data based on a query parameter (`type`). It uses two separate SQL queries: `sqlQueryDelivery` for delivery data and `SqlQueryVesselArrival` for vessel arrival data.  The `useWhere` variable, generated by `buildMtrUserCondition`, is used to filter results based on user authorization.  Several revisions focused on adding or removing the `useWhere` condition within the `SqlQueryVesselArrival` query, ultimately restoring it to its original state in the final revision.  Additional `console.log` statements were added and removed in various revisions for debugging purposes.  The logging consistently tracks query execution and result counts.  There are no fundamental changes to the logic of this function.
