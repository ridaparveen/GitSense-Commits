# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 3:32:10 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `ShippingBillTable.tsx` between 9:19 PM and 9:44 PM on August 9th, 2025.  The component was initially implemented using a custom table with styling from Tailwind CSS.  It was then refactored to use MUI's `DataGrid` component.

The refactoring involved:

* **Significant Change (9:20 PM):**  A complete switch from a custom table implementation using `<table>` and Tailwind CSS to the Material UI DataGrid (`@mui/x-data-grid`). This involved replacing custom rendering logic with MUI's data grid features.  Import statements changed to reflect the new dependency.  The `lucide-react` icon library was added for some icons at 9:23 PM and `AddCircle` was added later from `@mui/icons-material`.

* **Data Structure Changes:** The data structure changed from a `ShippingBill` type to a `RowData` type.  The `RowData` type now includes an `isNew` flag to differentiate between existing and new rows.  The `cbm` and `grWt` fields were changed to accept either numbers or strings.

* **Functionality:**  The component retained its core functionality of displaying a table of shipping bills, allowing for row selection and adding new rows. The add and delete operations are changed.  The add operation now adds a new row to the end of the table and the delete operation removes only the "new" rows.

* **Input Handling:** Input handling in the editable row was improved by mapping each field to its respective input in `handleInputChange`.  The editable fields are now rendered using the `renderEditableCell` function.

* **Minor Changes (9:33 PM - 9:44 PM):** These edits focused on refinement of the data types (using `interface` instead of `type` at 9:33 PM) and further adjustments to the column definitions within the `DataGrid`, specifically changing the width of the select column at 9:34 PM and adding a few imports.  An `IoIosAddCircle` import was added at 9:41 PM.

In summary, the code evolved from a less efficient custom table component to a more robust and maintainable implementation leveraging the Material UI DataGrid.  The final version supports adding and deleting rows, input changes, and row selection. The changes show a clear migration to a more modern and feature-rich UI component library.
