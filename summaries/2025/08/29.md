# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 9:48:40 AM
The log shows the development of a vessel management system API.  The `vesselService.ts` file underwent significant revisions between 4:45 PM and 5:36 PM on August 28, 2025.  These changes focused primarily on the `saveVessel` function, which handles creating and updating vessel records in a database.

Initially, `vesselService.ts` contained a basic `saveVessel` function that simply retrieved all vessel data.  Subsequent updates introduced more sophisticated functionality.  A `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class was added to handle the construction of complex SQL queries for data retrieval, supporting pagination, filtering by status (active/inactive), searching, and date range filtering.  The queries utilize parameterized queries using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive searches and `LOWER()` with `IN` clause for case-insensitive filtering.

Around 5:07 PM, `saveVessel` was updated to use database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and to distinguish between insert (ADD) and update (UPDATE) operations based on the presence of a `serail_id`.  The date formatting was also improved using the `AppDateFormate` utility function from `common.ts`, which handles various date formats, specifically including the YYYY-MM-DD format used in the database.  The `common.ts` file was updated to add a date formatting function, further solidifying the date handling capabilities.

Further refinements in `vesselService.ts` (around 5:19 PM and 5:21 PM) integrated the `uuid` library to generate unique identifiers (`serail_id`) for new vessels if not provided in the request.  The `saveVessel` function was structured for better error handling and included clearer status messages in the responses.

Around 5:22 PM, a significant change involved  refactoring  `saveVessel` to correctly handle the `serail_id`. For updates, it now explicitly excludes `serail_id` from the `updateQuery` payload, relying on the where clause to identify the record. For inserts, the database's auto-generation of  `serail_id` is utilized.


The `models/common/types/vessel.ts` file was modified several times to refine the interfaces (`VesselQueryType`, `VesselPayloadTypes`, `VesselRequestBodyType`)  used for data types related to vessels, mainly improving type definition of `VesselPayloadTypes` and introducing  `VesselRequestBodyType`.

Finally, the `routes/VesselRoutes.ts` file defines the API routes for retrieving (`GET`) and saving (`POST`) vessel data.  The `common/constants/Paths.ts` file defines the path constants used in the routing.

The overall pattern in the code changes reflects an iterative process of improving the functionality, robustness, and error handling of the API, moving from a simple data retrieval function to a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation for managing vessel data with strong type safety and optimized SQL query building.  The updates between 5:07 PM and 5:36 PM represent the most substantial changes.


## 10:48:38 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `vesselService.ts` file and the `vessel.ts` file between 9:54 AM and 10:31 AM on August 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the data handling and querying mechanisms for vessel information.

**`vessel.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This file, defining types related to vessels, saw minor revisions. The most significant change was a fluctuation in the `serail_id` type within `VesselQueryType`, changing from `string | any` to `Number` and back to `string | any`.  No other major changes to the structure or types were observed. These revisions likely reflect indecision on the best data type for the serial ID.


**`vesselService.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent several revisions, mostly focused on the `addSearchClause` method within the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class and the `getVessel` function.

* **Initial Version (9:54 AM):**  The initial version shows a well-structured `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class designed for building flexible SQL queries, handling pagination, ordering, searching, and filtering based on various vessel attributes. The `getVessel` function uses this class to fetch vessel data.

* **Subsequent Revisions (10:17 AM - 10:31 AM):**  The main changes involved the `addSearchClause` method:
    * Initially, it used `ILIKE`.
    * Then, it was changed to `TEXT ILIKE` and finally to `::TEXT ILIKE`, indicating adjustments to how string searches are performed in the underlying database (likely to improve type safety and performance in PostgreSQL). The `getVessel` function also had its `page` default value changed from 2 to 1, a correction possibly identified after testing.  A minor change was made to correct the `addFilterClause` to utilize `vs.status` instead of `abe.booking_status`. Finally, additional `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes.  


In summary, the code changes represent a refinement process.  The `vessel.ts` file experienced minor, transient type adjustments. The `vesselService.ts` file's revisions center on improving the SQL query construction for more robust and type-safe database interactions, particularly string searches.  The addition of logging statements suggests a debugging or testing phase. The changes suggest a continuous improvement cycle with a focus on better handling of data types and query performance.


## 11:48:40 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `vesselService.ts` file between 11:16 AM and 11:43 AM on August 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class and the `saveVessel` function.

**`vesselService.ts` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (11:16 AM):** This version defines the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class for constructing SQL queries to retrieve and count vessel data. It handles pagination, sorting, filtering (including date ranges), and searching. The `getVessel` function uses this query builder to fetch vessel data and counts, returning the results as a JSON response. The `saveVessel` function handles both adding and updating vessel entries using database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).

* **Subsequent Revisions (11:28 AM, 11:28:47 AM):**  Minor changes, likely related to code formatting or minor bug fixes.  No substantial functional differences are observable. The most notable change is that `updated_at` field is set to `new Date()` in the `saveVessel` function.

* **Revision at 11:33:56 AM:** The `setDateRange` function in `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` is modified to directly use the provided `fromDate` and `toDate` without null checks, implying a change in how date ranges are handled or assumed to be always provided.

* **Revisions at 11:35:51 AM and 11:37:28 AM:** The `addDateRangeClause` function undergoes significant changes in how it handles date ranges in the SQL query. Initially, it used simple string concatenation for date comparison (`BETWEEN '${startDate}' AND '${endDate}'`).  The final version uses explicit `DATE` or `timestamp` casting to improve type safety and prevent potential SQL injection issues (`BETWEEN '${startDate}'::timestamp AND '${endDate}'::timestamp`). The brackets around the field name in `addDateRangeClause` are also removed between revisions 11:37 and 11:38, indicating another potential bug fix. 

* **Revision at 11:38:52 AM:** Another alteration in `addDateRangeClause` suggesting further refinement in the date range handling. The final version uses `field[1]` instead of the field name directly, which is not a standard SQL syntax.  This change is likely erroneous or specific to a database system with unusual array indexing. 

* **Revision at 11:42:29 AM:** This revision reverts the changes made at 11:33:56 AM, restoring the null checks to the `setDateRange` method. This suggests the previous direct use of `fromDate` and `toDate` without null handling was causing issues.

* **Final Revision (11:42:43 AM):**  The `saveVessel` function is updated to use the `AppDateFormate` function to format the `built_at` date before saving it to the database, likely enforcing a specific date format for consistency.


**`src\models\common\types\vessel.ts` Updates (11:27:14 AM):**

This file defines TypeScript interfaces and an enum for vessel data.  The changes are limited to type definitions and do not directly affect the query logic. Notably,  the `VesselPayloadTypes` interface now allows both `string` and `Date` objects for `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.


**Recurring Elements:**

The modifications consistently center around the handling of date ranges and improving the robustness of the query building process within `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder`.  There's a pattern of iterative refinement in the SQL query construction, addressing potential issues and improving type safety.  The use of database transactions in `saveVessel` demonstrates a commitment to data integrity.  Several revisions to date range handling might indicate initial flaws in the implementation that were discovered and subsequently addressed through iteration.


## 1:22:08 PM
The log shows development of a React frontend application, focusing on vessel data management.  Key changes are concentrated around the `vesselDataApi` and related components.

**`src\services\ApiMethods.ts` (12:07:38 PM):** This file defines a class `ApiMethods` for making API requests. It uses `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` to dynamically set the API base URL and includes authentication headers using local storage.  It supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

**`src\store\api\vesselDataApi.ts` (Multiple Updates):**  This file undergoes multiple revisions, primarily refining the API calls for fetching and saving vessel data using Redux Toolkit's `createApi`.

* Initial versions (12:13:27 PM and 12:16:03 PM) have a typo in the filename (`vesseDataApi`) and establish basic endpoints (`saveVessel`, `fetchVesselDashboardData`) with appropriate query parameters and headers.

* Later updates (12:28:58 PM and 12:29:57 PM) improve the `fetchVesselDashboardData` endpoint to handle optional query parameters more robustly and change API endpoint for fetching vessel dashboard data from `/master/vessel-dashboard` to `/api/master/vessel-dashboard`. The filename typo is corrected.


**`src\components\screen\vessel\VesselDashboard.tsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component displays vessel data in a datagrid.

* The initial version (12:18:23 PM) uses dummy data (`vesselData`). It includes features for filtering, sorting, searching, and exporting data to Excel.

* The final version (12:32:43 PM) integrates with the `vesselDataApi` to fetch and display real vessel data.  It removes the usage of dummy data and updates the `AppGrid`'s `uniqueId` from `id` to `serial_id`.


**`src\store\store.ts` (Multiple Updates):** This file configures the Redux store. The `userDataApi` is initially commented out, and later updates replace the middleware for `userDataApi` with `vesseDataApi` indicating a refocus on vessel data handling.


**`src\store\api\userDataApi.js` (12:25:12 PM):** This file is commented out, suggesting that user data handling might be temporarily deferred or removed.

In summary, the codebase evolves from using placeholder data to dynamically fetching and displaying vessel data using Redux Toolkit.  The API interaction is standardized, and there's a shift in focus away from user data towards vessel-related features.  A significant portion of the changes were focused on correcting typos and improving functionality.


## 2:22:05 PM
The log shows modifications to `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\vesselService.ts` on 8/29/2025 at 1:45:53 PM.  This file contains TypeScript code for managing vessel data.  The key changes involve the creation of a `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class which constructs dynamic SQL queries for retrieving and counting vessels based on various criteria including pagination, filtering (by vessel name, line name, status, date range), and sorting.  The code handles both selecting vessel data and building count queries for different statuses (all, active, inactive).  It also includes functions to retrieve distinct values for vessel name, line name and status for dropdown options.

The `getVessel` function uses the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` to fetch and return vessel data along with aggregated counts and options.  Error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks, with appropriate HTTP status codes returned.

The `saveVessel` function handles both creating and updating vessel records.  It determines the entry mode (ADD or UPDATE) based on the presence of a serial ID in the request body.  Database transactions are used (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency.  The function returns success/error messages and the updated/inserted vessel data.  The code uses parameterized queries via the `insertQuery` and `updateQuery` functions (not shown in the log, but implied by their use), improving security by preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Date formatting is handled using the `AppDateFormate` function (also not directly shown).


## 3:56:50 PM
The log shows two commits to `booking-dashboard.tsx` within one minute on August 29th, 2025.  Both commits contain nearly identical code for a React component responsible for displaying a booking dashboard. The only difference lies in the `onChange` handler within the `<InputBox>` component.

The first commit (2:53:05 PM) uses `dashboardSelector.filters.pol` as a fallback value if `dashboardSelector.filters.agent_booking_id` is undefined.  The second commit (2:54:24 PM) replaces this fallback with an empty string (`""`). This suggests a bug fix; the previous fallback likely caused unexpected behavior when the `agent_booking_id` filter was not set.  The rest of the component remains unchanged, displaying booking data using cards and a grid, incorporating filtering and sorting functionalities via a sidebar and dropdown respectively.  The component fetches data using `useFetchBookingDashboardDataQuery` and utilizes Redux for state management.  The code is well-structured and uses many React components and styling.


## 3:56:54 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `vesselService.ts` file between 2:23 PM and 3:04 PM on August 29, 2025.  The core functionality of the file, handling vessel data via database queries (`query`, `updateQuery`, `insertQuery`), remains unchanged throughout.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class and its associated `getVessel` function.

The first significant change (2:28:56 PM) enhances the `getVessel` function's response by adding styling information ( `title`, `bgColor`, `iconColor`) to the `counts` array, improving the presentation of vessel count data.

Subsequent changes (2:50:10 PM, 2:56:40 PM, 3:02:20 PM, 3:04:37 PM) iteratively improve the `addSearchClause` method within the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class. Initially, this method accepted a single search field and value.  The revisions transform it to accept an array of fields, allowing for searches across multiple vessel attributes simultaneously. This is achieved by using an `OR` condition to combine the search criteria for each field within a single query.  The specific fields included in the search are progressively expanded across these commits, starting from only `vs.serail_id` to finally include `vs.serail_id`, `vs.vessel_name`, `vs.line_name`, and `vs.igm_code`.  Furthermore, the regular expression used to split the `orderBy` parameter in `buildSelectQuery` is changed from `"*"` to `/[-\*]/` to better handle various order-by string formats.


The `saveVessel` function remains consistent throughout the log, retaining its functionality for adding and updating vessel records in the database.  There is no modification to this part of the code across the commits.


## 5:58:57 PM
The log shows several revisions to the `vesselService.ts` file and the creation of `VesselRoutes.ts` on August 29th, 2025.  The `vesselService.ts` file underwent multiple iterations, primarily focusing on enhancements to the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class and the addition of a new `fetchVesselData` function.

**`vesselService.ts` Changes:**

* **4:03:50 PM:** The initial version of `vesselService.ts` contained functions for retrieving (`getVessel`) and saving (`saveVessel`) vessel data.  `getVessel` included query building logic for pagination, filtering, and searching.  `saveVessel` handled both creating and updating vessel records using database transactions.  The query builder used different methods (`addSearchClause`, `addFilterClause`, `addDateRangeClause`) to construct SQL queries dynamically.

* **4:11:07 PM:** A minor revision to `vesselService.ts` occurred, but the code content remained largely the same, suggesting only minor formatting or whitespace changes, rather than functional changes.

* **4:33:27 PM:** A significant change was made to the `buildCountQuery` function within the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class.  The modification added the ability to filter count queries by a date range, improving data retrieval flexibility.

* **4:35:13 PM:** This revision reverted the changes introduced at 4:33:27 PM, returning the `buildCountQuery` function to its previous state. The reason for this revert is unclear from the provided log.

* **5:34:50 PM:**  A new function, `fetchVesselData`, was added to retrieve a single vessel's details based on the `serail_id`. This function constructs a simple SELECT query to fetch specified fields from the `vessel` table.

* **5:35:21 PM:** A minor correction was made to the `fetchVesselData` function; a space was removed from a field name within the query, " built_at" becoming "built_at".

**`VesselRoutes.ts` Changes:**

* **5:41:15 PM:** This file was created to define routes for vessel-related operations. It uses the `Paths` constants defined elsewhere to map HTTP methods (GET and POST) to the corresponding functions in `vesselService.ts`.  The routes handle fetching vessel dashboard data, saving (creating/updating) vessels, and fetching individual vessel details.

**Recurring Elements:**

The `vesselService.ts` file consistently uses asynchronous database operations (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`), demonstrates robust error handling with try-catch blocks and transaction management (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`), and relies on strongly-typed variables for request bodies and query parameters. The frequent updates to `vesselService.ts` suggest ongoing development and refinement of vessel data handling.


## 6:00:22 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `VesselDashboard` component and related files within a React application.  The updates span from August 29th, 2025, between 1:47 PM and 5:58 PM.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel\VesselDashboard.tsx`**: This file underwent extensive modifications throughout the log.  The core functionality remains consistent: displaying a vessel list with filtering, sorting, searching, and exporting to Excel.  Key changes include:

* **Initial State (1:47 PM):**  The component initially used dummy data.  Subsequent changes integrated Redux state management and API calls (`useFetchVesselDashboardDataQuery`) to retrieve and update vessel data dynamically.
* **Filter Implementation (1:48 PM - 1:56 PM):** Several iterations refined the filter functionality. The `filterConfig` array was modified to use dynamic options from the API response,  and the `dateRange` filter type changed from `"date-range"` to `"date"`  and finally back to `date-range`, then finally to `date`. The `handleFilterChange` and `handleClearFilters` functions were updated to correctly dispatch Redux actions. The search functionality was improved.
* **Pagination Enhancement (2:44 PM - 2:45 PM):**  Pagination was enhanced to use Redux actions (`vesselDashboardSetPagination`) for updating page and page size,  replacing direct state updates. `AppGrid` was updated to use `handlePage` and `handlePageSizeChange` for page and page size management.
* **Sort Functionality (2:41 PM - 2:45 PM):** Sorting capabilities were added using Redux (`setVesselDashboardSortBy`) to update the sort order. `SortDropdown` was updated to reflect selected value.
* **Search Field Update (2:38 PM - 2:41 PM):** The name attribute of the search input box was changed from `"search_booking_no"` to `"serail_id"`.  The search functionality was modified to search across several fields of the vessel data and utilize Redux for managing the search terms and updates.
* **Excel Export Refinement (2:16 PM):**  The `handleExcel` function was updated to ensure it only exports valid data; using a conditional operator to check the existence of data before exporting.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\vessel.types.ts`**: This file defines types related to vessels, filters, and pagination models. A `FilterType` was added to accurately represent data structure sent to api. The  `igm_vessel_code` field was renamed to `igm_code`.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\common\tailwind_common\filter.tsx`**: This component for the filter sidebar was significantly revised (2:01 PM - 2:14 PM). The changes involve:

* **Improved Type Definitions:** Type definitions improved to encompass more filter types (text, date, date-range, radio, checkbox) and handle checkbox selections more robustly.
* **Refactoring:** The component was refactored to improve code structure and handle date-range inputs efficiently.  Clear all button updated to handle multiple filter types.
* **Filter state normalization:** The `handleApply` function normalizes the filter data before sending it to backend, removing nested objects.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel\OverviewContainer.tsx`**:  This component displays an overview of vessel data. It initially fetched data without parameters.  Major changes (2:22 PM - 4:36 PM) included:

* **Data fetching:** Data was initially fetched without parameters, then multiple attempts to fix data mapping, eventually a solution was found using `useFetchVesselDashboardDataQuery` with `fromDate` and `toDate` fetched from Redux state for filtering.
* **Error handling:** added checks to prevent undefined errors from API data


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\vessel\VesselDetailsPage.tsx`**: This page handles new vessel creation and editing.  Significant updates involved:

* **Initial Values (4:39 PM - 5:13 PM):** Initial values management changed in several versions until using a cleaner approach with a proper initial value object.
* **API Integration (5:02 PM - 5:13 PM):**  The component was updated to use `useSaveVesselMutation` to handle saving vessels via the API.
* **Navigation (5:07 PM - 5:13 PM):** Added navigation back to vessel list after successful save, using `setTimeout` and checking the `status` in the response.
* **Edit Functionality (5:48 PM - 5:58 PM):**  Functionality to edit existing vessels, added by fetching initial values from the API based on `serail_id` passed from navigation.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\api\vesselDataApi.ts`**: This file defines API endpoints for interacting with vessel data. The updates include:
* **Added API calls:** Added new endpoint `fetchVesselDetails` to fetch vessel details based on `serail_id`


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel\VesselDetailsForm.tsx`**: Form component for adding and editing vessels.  Improvements focused on:

* **Form Handling (4:41 PM - 5:54 PM):** Formik was used to manage the form state and submission. Initial values corrected to use `formik.initialValues` for rendering to avoid uncontrolled component error.  `built_at` field type updated to `"date"`.
* **Input field names:** Updated to match backend api naming conventions.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\vessel\action.tsx`**:  This file defines actions for the vessel grid.
* **Updated actions:**  Removed unused actions and reduced to only Edit action.


**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\vessel-dashboard-columns.tsx`**: This file defines columns for the vessel dashboard grid.  The `getVesselActions` function was used to populate the actions column. Updated to reflect changes in `action.tsx`

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\store\fretures\vesselDashboardSlice.ts`**: This Redux slice manages the state for the Vessel Dashboard. A `serail_id` property added to `filters` object to match updated `VesselDashboard` component.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\types\enquiry.types.ts`**: This file contains type definitions; not directly related to core vessel functionality changes.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\config\data.ts`**: This file contains dummy data for vessel overview; its role lessened as API data became primary.

In summary, the codebase has been significantly improved by: integrating a backend API for dynamic data fetching and updates,  implementing Redux for state management,  refining filtering and sorting mechanisms, and enhancing the user experience with clear feedback using `react-hot-toast`.  The addition of editing functionality also showcases a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation for vessel management.
