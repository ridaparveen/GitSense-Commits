# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 9:48:40 AM
The log shows the development of a vessel management system API.  The `vesselService.ts` file underwent significant revisions between 4:45 PM and 5:36 PM on August 28, 2025.  These changes focused primarily on the `saveVessel` function, which handles creating and updating vessel records in a database.

Initially, `vesselService.ts` contained a basic `saveVessel` function that simply retrieved all vessel data.  Subsequent updates introduced more sophisticated functionality.  A `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class was added to handle the construction of complex SQL queries for data retrieval, supporting pagination, filtering by status (active/inactive), searching, and date range filtering.  The queries utilize parameterized queries using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive searches and `LOWER()` with `IN` clause for case-insensitive filtering.

Around 5:07 PM, `saveVessel` was updated to use database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and to distinguish between insert (ADD) and update (UPDATE) operations based on the presence of a `serail_id`.  The date formatting was also improved using the `AppDateFormate` utility function from `common.ts`, which handles various date formats, specifically including the YYYY-MM-DD format used in the database.  The `common.ts` file was updated to add a date formatting function, further solidifying the date handling capabilities.

Further refinements in `vesselService.ts` (around 5:19 PM and 5:21 PM) integrated the `uuid` library to generate unique identifiers (`serail_id`) for new vessels if not provided in the request.  The `saveVessel` function was structured for better error handling and included clearer status messages in the responses.

Around 5:22 PM, a significant change involved  refactoring  `saveVessel` to correctly handle the `serail_id`. For updates, it now explicitly excludes `serail_id` from the `updateQuery` payload, relying on the where clause to identify the record. For inserts, the database's auto-generation of  `serail_id` is utilized.


The `models/common/types/vessel.ts` file was modified several times to refine the interfaces (`VesselQueryType`, `VesselPayloadTypes`, `VesselRequestBodyType`)  used for data types related to vessels, mainly improving type definition of `VesselPayloadTypes` and introducing  `VesselRequestBodyType`.

Finally, the `routes/VesselRoutes.ts` file defines the API routes for retrieving (`GET`) and saving (`POST`) vessel data.  The `common/constants/Paths.ts` file defines the path constants used in the routing.

The overall pattern in the code changes reflects an iterative process of improving the functionality, robustness, and error handling of the API, moving from a simple data retrieval function to a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation for managing vessel data with strong type safety and optimized SQL query building.  The updates between 5:07 PM and 5:36 PM represent the most substantial changes.
