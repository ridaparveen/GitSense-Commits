# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 9:48:40 AM
The log shows the development of a vessel management system API.  The `vesselService.ts` file underwent significant revisions between 4:45 PM and 5:36 PM on August 28, 2025.  These changes focused primarily on the `saveVessel` function, which handles creating and updating vessel records in a database.

Initially, `vesselService.ts` contained a basic `saveVessel` function that simply retrieved all vessel data.  Subsequent updates introduced more sophisticated functionality.  A `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class was added to handle the construction of complex SQL queries for data retrieval, supporting pagination, filtering by status (active/inactive), searching, and date range filtering.  The queries utilize parameterized queries using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive searches and `LOWER()` with `IN` clause for case-insensitive filtering.

Around 5:07 PM, `saveVessel` was updated to use database transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and to distinguish between insert (ADD) and update (UPDATE) operations based on the presence of a `serail_id`.  The date formatting was also improved using the `AppDateFormate` utility function from `common.ts`, which handles various date formats, specifically including the YYYY-MM-DD format used in the database.  The `common.ts` file was updated to add a date formatting function, further solidifying the date handling capabilities.

Further refinements in `vesselService.ts` (around 5:19 PM and 5:21 PM) integrated the `uuid` library to generate unique identifiers (`serail_id`) for new vessels if not provided in the request.  The `saveVessel` function was structured for better error handling and included clearer status messages in the responses.

Around 5:22 PM, a significant change involved  refactoring  `saveVessel` to correctly handle the `serail_id`. For updates, it now explicitly excludes `serail_id` from the `updateQuery` payload, relying on the where clause to identify the record. For inserts, the database's auto-generation of  `serail_id` is utilized.


The `models/common/types/vessel.ts` file was modified several times to refine the interfaces (`VesselQueryType`, `VesselPayloadTypes`, `VesselRequestBodyType`)  used for data types related to vessels, mainly improving type definition of `VesselPayloadTypes` and introducing  `VesselRequestBodyType`.

Finally, the `routes/VesselRoutes.ts` file defines the API routes for retrieving (`GET`) and saving (`POST`) vessel data.  The `common/constants/Paths.ts` file defines the path constants used in the routing.

The overall pattern in the code changes reflects an iterative process of improving the functionality, robustness, and error handling of the API, moving from a simple data retrieval function to a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation for managing vessel data with strong type safety and optimized SQL query building.  The updates between 5:07 PM and 5:36 PM represent the most substantial changes.


## 10:48:38 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `vesselService.ts` file and the `vessel.ts` file between 9:54 AM and 10:31 AM on August 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the data handling and querying mechanisms for vessel information.

**`vessel.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This file, defining types related to vessels, saw minor revisions. The most significant change was a fluctuation in the `serail_id` type within `VesselQueryType`, changing from `string | any` to `Number` and back to `string | any`.  No other major changes to the structure or types were observed. These revisions likely reflect indecision on the best data type for the serial ID.


**`vesselService.ts` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent several revisions, mostly focused on the `addSearchClause` method within the `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class and the `getVessel` function.

* **Initial Version (9:54 AM):**  The initial version shows a well-structured `VesselDashboardQueryBuilder` class designed for building flexible SQL queries, handling pagination, ordering, searching, and filtering based on various vessel attributes. The `getVessel` function uses this class to fetch vessel data.

* **Subsequent Revisions (10:17 AM - 10:31 AM):**  The main changes involved the `addSearchClause` method:
    * Initially, it used `ILIKE`.
    * Then, it was changed to `TEXT ILIKE` and finally to `::TEXT ILIKE`, indicating adjustments to how string searches are performed in the underlying database (likely to improve type safety and performance in PostgreSQL). The `getVessel` function also had its `page` default value changed from 2 to 1, a correction possibly identified after testing.  A minor change was made to correct the `addFilterClause` to utilize `vs.status` instead of `abe.booking_status`. Finally, additional `console.log` statements were added for debugging purposes.  


In summary, the code changes represent a refinement process.  The `vessel.ts` file experienced minor, transient type adjustments. The `vesselService.ts` file's revisions center on improving the SQL query construction for more robust and type-safe database interactions, particularly string searches.  The addition of logging statements suggests a debugging or testing phase. The changes suggest a continuous improvement cycle with a focus on better handling of data types and query performance.
