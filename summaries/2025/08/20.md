# Activity Summary for 8/20/2025

## 10:56:25 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` between 10:20 AM and 10:33 AM on August 20, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing and displaying GST locations for customers.  The key changes revolve around handling the initial values of GST locations within a Formik form.

Initially, the component simply displayed a list of GST locations passed from a previous page via the `useLocation` hook.  Subsequent updates significantly improved how new GST locations are added and integrated with the existing ones.

Specifically, the `initialGstLocations` function was introduced to handle the merging of newly added GST information with any pre-existing GST locations.  Earlier versions either overwrote or only displayed existing locations, preventing proper management of multiple GST entries.  The final version correctly appends a newly added GST location to the existing list, passed via the `existingGstLocations` property in the state object.  A debugging `console.log` statement was also added to track `existingGstLocations`.  Finally, some type annotations were added for better code clarity.  The `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` file, updated at 10:27:30 AM, shows a form for managing broader customer details. This form uses Formik and includes many input fields for various customer attributes (address, contact information, etc.).  It navigates to `GstCustomerLocation.tsx` upon submission, passing form values as state.  There is no significant recurring pattern beyond the use of Formik and Tailwind CSS styling across both components.
