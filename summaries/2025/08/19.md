# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 5:02:55 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `InvoiceDetailsForm.tsx` component and the `InvoicePartyDetails.tsx` component, along with some changes to `dummy-data.ts` and `invoice-columns.tsx`.  There are also changes made to `CustomerGSTForm.tsx`  and `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` towards the end of the log.


**`InvoiceDetailsForm.tsx` (8/19/2025):**  This component underwent several revisions between 12:28 PM and 1:05 PM.  The primary changes involved the `footer` function which displays GST calculations.  Initially, only GST Payable was shown.  Subsequent edits added CGST, SGST, and IGST calculations, and also changed the `justify`  and `gap`  props for styling. The gap values were changed multiple times to adjust spacing. Finally, the `justify` was changed from `justify-between` to `justify-start`. A modal for `Party Details` was added and integrated with `InvoicePartyDetails` component, with the `onClick` handler of `InputGroupedButtonWithSearch` component enabling the modal. The final change removed the unnecessary import of `AppGrid` and `InputGroupedButton`.


**`InvoicePartyDetails.tsx` (8/19/2025):** This component, initially a simple placeholder, was substantially developed between 12:32 PM and 1:05 PM.  It was transformed into a component displaying party details using `AppGrid` from `@components/common/tailwind_common/datagrid`,  and also introduced props to receive the `formik` object,  `onClose` function, `type`, `onSubmitParty` function, and `setOpen` function.  The `AppGrid`'s data source was initially empty, later updated to use `INVOICE_PARTY_DETAILS_DATA` from `dummy-data.ts`. The `pageSizeOptions` was modified several times.  A submit handler was also added that sets the "parent_group" value in the formik object using data selected from the grid.


**`dummy-data.ts` (8/19/2025):** This file contains several dummy data arrays (`enqueryData`, `ENQUIRY_NOMINATION_DATA`, `bookingData`, `mblData`). No changes were made to the content of these arrays; only `INVOICE_PARTY_DETAILS_DATA` was added.


**`invoice-columns.tsx` (8/19/2025):** This file defines column configurations for data grids.  The `PARTY_DETAILS_COLUMNS` function was modified to include a radio button selection for choosing a party detail and using `selectedRowId` and `setSelectedRowId` for selecting the row in the grid.  The addition of a `setSelectedRowId` parameter in the `PARTY_DETAILS_COLUMNS` function was added to enable radio button selection functionality. An unnecessary parameter was later removed.

**`CustomerGSTForm.tsx` (8/19/2025):** This component, added towards the end of the log (starting from 3:23 PM), is a form for managing GST locations for a customer. It features functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting GST locations and shows the customer's details. The component's structure and styling are refined during multiple edits, changing elements from `div` and table elements to `Card` and `InputBox` components for better consistency and styling.  The page is wrapped in `PageWrapper` component to provide a consistent layout, including the addition of a back button and a title that changes.

**`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` (8/19/2025):** This page is also modified at the end of the log (from 4:10 PM) and contains a form for entering new customer details. A modal is added to allow getting existing customer data and the page is improved by adding a back button that leads to the customer page. The modal is later removed.



The overall pattern shows iterative development and refinement of the UI components, focusing on improving the user interface and the interaction between different components.  The frequent updates in short intervals suggest an agile development process.
