# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 10:46:53 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files within an Envosys frontend application, primarily focusing on forms for managing HBL (House Bill of Lading) parties.  The most significant changes occur in `AddHblParties.tsx`.

**`AddHblParties.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent extensive modification throughout the log.  Initial versions (8/20/2025, 3:27:58 PM and 3:28:11 PM) were basic forms for adding HBL parties, including fields for name, contact information, address, and party type selection using a `MultiSelectBox`. A key change at 3:36:52 PM involved renaming and restructuring several input field names (`email` to `email_id`, `contactPerson` to `contact_person`, etc.) to match a consistent naming convention.  Later revisions (starting 4:07:31 PM) introduced an additional section for "Additional Configuration,"  including a dynamically generated table for custom broker details, with options to add and remove rows.  Finally, the Additional Configuration section was simplified to include only `CustomeBroker` and `BondHolder` components. The final version (8/21/2025, 10:21:56 AM) is a refined version that removes redundant code and uses `CustomeBroker` and `BondHolder` components.


**`ShipperForm.tsx` (Two Revisions):**  This component, initially (8/20/2025, 3:30:51 PM) lacking proper formik integration in `AutocompleteBox`'s `onValueChange` and `handleOptionChange` functions,  was updated (8/20/2025, 3:33:13 PM) to correctly use `formik.setFieldValue` to update formik state.

**`Notify1Form.tsx` (Two Revisions):** Similar to `ShipperForm.tsx`, this component's initial version (8/20/2025, 3:34:40 PM) had placeholder `onValueChange` and `handleOptionChange` functions in `AutocompleteBox`.  These were updated (8/20/2025, 3:35:44 PM) to use the correct formik values.

**`AddNewHblForm.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component serves as a main form for creating a new HBL.  Its evolution is characterized by the addition of the `AddHblParties` modal functionality, starting around 8/20/2025, 3:39:47 PM.  Several revisions focused on refining the `handleAddParty` function to correctly map the data from the modal to the main form's Formik values.  The final version (8/20/2025, 4:01:48 PM and later) handles normalization of keys from the `rawPartyData` coming from `AddHblParties`, before updating the `formik` values, making it more robust and flexible.


**Recurring Elements:** The use of Formik for form management, and consistent use of custom React components (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`, `MultiSelectBox`) from a common library (`@components`) are common across all files.  There's a consistent use of tailwind CSS classes for styling.


**Overall Pattern:** The code changes demonstrate iterative development, with an initial focus on functionality, followed by refinement of data handling and a shift towards component-based structure (e.g., the introduction of `CustomeBroker` and `BondHolder` components).  The consistent updates in multiple files point towards a concerted effort to improve form management within the application.
