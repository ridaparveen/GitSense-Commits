# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 10:43:21 AM
The `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` component was updated on August 5th, 2025, at 9:58:48 AM.  This React component uses Formik for form management and includes several UI elements from a custom component library (`@components`).  The component displays and interacts with data related to shipping bills, using an `AppGrid` to show a table of data (currently hardcoded, with 8 identical rows).  The form fields include options for container number, size type, POD (port of discharge), agent name, total CBM, and total gross weight.  The component renders two sections for "Planned Shipping Bills" and "Shipping Bills (Hub Stuffing)", both using the same `AppGrid` to display the data.  There are also `EstimatedShippingBills` and `PlannedShippingBills` components used, likely for more detailed views of the respective data,  and standard form submission and cancellation buttons. The form submission logs the values to the console.  The data displayed in the grid is currently placeholder data with repetitive entries.  The component utilizes AutocompleteBox and InputBox for user input.


## 1:43:27 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within an Envosys frontend application.  The most significant changes involve the `src\config\data.ts` file, which underwent multiple revisions between 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM. These revisions modified the `customerData` array, primarily altering the icons associated with customer status.  Specifically, the icon for "Total Customer" and "Inactive Customer" changed multiple times, ultimately settling on `BiSolidXCircle` and `FaCircleCheck` respectively, while the icon for "Active Customer" was updated to `FaCircleCheck`.  Other data arrays within `src\config\data.ts` (dashboardData, bookingData, etc.) remained largely consistent.

Between 12:50 PM and 12:50 PM, a minor correction was made to the `CustomerPage.tsx` file, removing an extra "1" from the `Customer Dashboard` title.

The `src\components\screen\customer\OverviewContainer.tsx` file was modified at 1:00 PM to improve the rendering of icons within the overview cards, wrapping them in a styled div to better manage color and size.

Finally, a new file, `src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDashboard.tsx`, appeared in the log at 1:36 PM. This file introduces a comprehensive customer dashboard component, featuring a searchable and filterable data grid, export functionality, and context menus for individual customer entries.  A subsequent update at 1:37 PM refactored this component, primarily simplifying the import of `InputBox` component.  The `src\data\coulms\customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` file, added at 1:41 PM, contains the configuration for the columns displayed in the CustomerDashboard's data grid.


## 3:08:03 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `CustomerDashboard.tsx` and `customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`.  The majority of changes are concentrated between 1:45 PM and 2:03 PM, focusing on `customer-dashboard-columns.tsx`.

**`customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` (Multiple Updates):** This file defines columns for a customer dashboard grid.  The significant changes involve iterative refinements to the styling and alignment of columns.  Specifically, the `headerAlign` property for several columns changed from `"center"` to `"left"` between 1:58 PM and 2:03 PM.  Additionally, the width of the `"pan"` and `"email_id"` columns was adjusted several times throughout the series of edits.  The `status` column's rendering was improved to display a pink badge for "Active" status and a lime badge otherwise.  Finally, the width of the "action" column was ultimately set to 250.

**`CustomerDashboard.tsx` (Two Updates):** This component renders the customer dashboard. The first update at 2:10 PM and second at 2:14 PM  involved refactoring the filter component from `Filter` to `FilterSidebar`, changing the filter configuration (`filterConfig`) significantly. The initial filter configuration included fields for "customer_id," "duration," "consignee," and "status." After the refactoring the `filterConfig`  was modified to use a more streamlined structure with updated fields. The "duration" filter changed from radio buttons to checkboxes and its label was also changed.  Furthermore, some unnecessary imports were removed in the final update at 2:14 PM, resulting in a more concise component.  The key change was the replacement of a general `Filter` component with a more specific `FilterSidebar` component.  This suggests a UI redesign focused on the filtering functionality.


## 4:08:03 PM
The log shows significant changes to two files: `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` and `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx`.  The modifications span from 3:11 PM to 4:07 PM on August 5th, 2025.

**`CustomerDetailsForm.tsx` Changes:**

The initial version (3:11 PM) used Material UI components (`Grid`, `Box`, `Card`, etc.) to render a customer details form.  This form contained numerous input fields (`InputBox`, `InputDropdown`, `SelectBoxExtend`) arranged in grids.  Subsequent updates (starting at 3:54 PM) transitioned the component to use Tailwind CSS components (`InputBox`, `SelectBox`).  The layout changed to a simpler `grid grid-cols-4` structure, removing the nested Material UI grids.  The styling, previously relying on Material UI's `sx` prop, was replaced with Tailwind classes.  Several commits involved minor adjustments to the layout and structure of the input fields, and the grouping of the input fields under headings such as "Sales Reps." and "Customer Service Reps.".  Finally, the `AppButton` components for submit and cancel were replaced with custom `Button` components.

**`CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` Changes:**

The `CustomerDetailsPage.tsx` file initially (3:17 PM) rendered the `CustomerDetailsForm` within a `PageWrapper` component. This wrapper provided basic page layout elements.  The initial state for `customerData` was defined with empty strings and arrays for various customer details.   A series of updates (3:23 PM - 3:28 PM) focused on adding a `SelectBox` component to the `PageWrapper.Left` section, presumably to select a customer status.  The most significant change was the addition of `<PageWrapper.Content>` to wrap the `<CustomerDetailsForm>` component, improving the page structure.  These commits show a shift toward using Tailwind CSS for styling as seen in the `className="w-[200px]"` addition, and further refined the styling with changes to the width.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **Consistent Data Structure:** The `CustomerFormValues` interface is consistently used throughout, suggesting a well-defined data model for customer information.
* **Component Replacement:**  A clear migration from Material UI components to Tailwind CSS components is observed in `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`.
* **Layout Refinement:** Multiple commits show ongoing adjustments to the layout and organization of input fields within `CustomerDetailsForm.tsx`, aiming for improved usability.

In summary, the log shows a refactoring of the customer details form component, primarily focusing on a UI framework shift from Material UI to Tailwind CSS and improving its layout and structure.  The associated page component was also updated to integrate these changes and add a customer status selector.
