# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 10:43:21 AM
The `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` component was updated on August 5th, 2025, at 9:58:48 AM.  This React component uses Formik for form management and includes several UI elements from a custom component library (`@components`).  The component displays and interacts with data related to shipping bills, using an `AppGrid` to show a table of data (currently hardcoded, with 8 identical rows).  The form fields include options for container number, size type, POD (port of discharge), agent name, total CBM, and total gross weight.  The component renders two sections for "Planned Shipping Bills" and "Shipping Bills (Hub Stuffing)", both using the same `AppGrid` to display the data.  There are also `EstimatedShippingBills` and `PlannedShippingBills` components used, likely for more detailed views of the respective data,  and standard form submission and cancellation buttons. The form submission logs the values to the console.  The data displayed in the grid is currently placeholder data with repetitive entries.  The component utilizes AutocompleteBox and InputBox for user input.

The log shows code changes across several files within an Envosys frontend application.  The most significant changes involve the `src\config\data.ts` file, which underwent multiple revisions between 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM. These revisions modified the `customerData` array, primarily altering the icons associated with customer status.  Specifically, the icon for "Total Customer" and "Inactive Customer" changed multiple times, ultimately settling on `BiSolidXCircle` and `FaCircleCheck` respectively, while the icon for "Active Customer" was updated to `FaCircleCheck`.  Other data arrays within `src\config\data.ts` (dashboardData, bookingData, etc.) remained largely consistent.

Between 12:50 PM and 12:50 PM, a minor correction was made to the `CustomerPage.tsx` file, removing an extra "1" from the `Customer Dashboard` title.

The `src\components\screen\customer\OverviewContainer.tsx` file was modified at 1:00 PM to improve the rendering of icons within the overview cards, wrapping them in a styled div to better manage color and size.

Finally, a new file, `src\components\screen\customer\CustomerDashboard.tsx`, appeared in the log at 1:36 PM. This file introduces a comprehensive customer dashboard component, featuring a searchable and filterable data grid, export functionality, and context menus for individual customer entries.  A subsequent update at 1:37 PM refactored this component, primarily simplifying the import of `InputBox` component.  The `src\data\coulms\customer-dashboard-columns.tsx` file, added at 1:41 PM, contains the configuration for the columns displayed in the CustomerDashboard's data grid.
