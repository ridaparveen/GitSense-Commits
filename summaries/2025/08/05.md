The `BoxPlanDetailsForm.tsx` component was updated on August 5th, 2025, at 9:58:48 AM.  This React component uses Formik for form management and includes several UI elements from a custom component library (`@components`).  The component displays and interacts with data related to shipping bills, using an `AppGrid` to show a table of data (currently hardcoded, with 8 identical rows).  The form fields include options for container number, size type, POD (port of discharge), agent name, total CBM, and total gross weight.  The component renders two sections for "Planned Shipping Bills" and "Shipping Bills (Hub Stuffing)", both using the same `AppGrid` to display the data.  There are also `EstimatedShippingBills` and `PlannedShippingBills` components used, likely for more detailed views of the respective data,  and standard form submission and cancellation buttons. The form submission logs the values to the console.  The data displayed in the grid is currently placeholder data with repetitive entries.  The component utilizes AutocompleteBox and InputBox for user input.
