# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 10:44:20 AM
The primary change involves the `auth.ts` file on August 6th, 2025 at 11:10:36 PM.  This commit integrates NextAuth.js for authentication, using GitHub as a provider and Prisma as the adapter.  The code utilizes environment variables (`AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_SECRET`) for sensitive configuration details.  The `NextAuth` function is destructured to export `auth`, `handlers`, `signIn`, and `signOut`.  A `console.log` statement confirms the availability of the GitHub client ID from environment variables.  The core update focuses on setting up authentication and authorization within the application.
