# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 10:44:20 AM
The primary change involves the `auth.ts` file on August 6th, 2025 at 11:10:36 PM.  This commit integrates NextAuth.js for authentication, using GitHub as a provider and Prisma as the adapter.  The code utilizes environment variables (`AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_SECRET`) for sensitive configuration details.  The `NextAuth` function is destructured to export `auth`, `handlers`, `signIn`, and `signOut`.  A `console.log` statement confirms the availability of the GitHub client ID from environment variables.  The core update focuses on setting up authentication and authorization within the application.


## 12:46:07 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `LoginPage.tsx`, a React component responsible for a login page.  The changes span from approximately 11:55 AM to 12:44 PM on August 7th, 2025.

Initially, the component used Material UI (`@mui/material`) for styling and layout, employing a `Grid` system to divide the page into two sections (login form and an image).  Over time, the Material UI components were progressively replaced with Tailwind CSS classes (`className`), resulting in a cleaner and more concise layout. This shift is evident in the removal of the `Grid` and `Box` components and their associated `styles` object.  The final version uses a single `div` for the main container with Tailwind classes for styling.

Between 11:56:01 AM and 11:58:58 AM, the right-hand side image was commented out, simplifying the layout to focus solely on the login form.

Further changes involved modifying the styling and structure of the login form itself. The heading changed from "Login To Your Account" to "Sign in to your account".  The `InputBox` component was updated, and  commented out lines of code suggest the progressive removal of unused components and features.  A `SelectBox` component was added for country selection in the signup form. The initial hardcoded login credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") remained unchanged.  Finally, a conditional rendering was implemented using a state variable `isLogin` to switch between login and signup forms, making the final version a single component capable of handling both login and signup functionalities.  The signup form includes a checkbox for email updates.  The logo was initially shown using an `img` tag, but later the tag and surrounding elements were commented out. A `TruckIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` was then introduced as a new logo.

The changes show a transition from a Material UI based layout to a Tailwind CSS based layout, suggesting a potential change in the preferred styling framework for the project. The overall evolution of the code indicates improved organization and a move towards a more streamlined and user-friendly design.


## 1:46:15 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `LoginPage.tsx`, a React component for a login page.  The most significant changes occur between 12:47 PM and 1:23 PM on August 7th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve refactoring the UI and adding functionality for password reset.

Initially, the component displayed a simple login/signup toggle. The styling heavily relied on Tailwind CSS classes.  Over time, several changes were made:

* **Styling Changes:**  The initial styling was refined throughout the edits.  The outer container's styling changed multiple times, moving from using `div` elements with a variety of Tailwind classes for positioning and sizing to  a more consistent use of  `className="w-full max-w-md p-8 mx-auto"`  to centrally position and size the login form.  Margin adjustments were also made to the outer container (`my-6`, `m-10`, `m-15`, `m-18`, `m-20`).  Some internal styling changes were made to the logo and heading sections, primarily involving the removal of extra div containers.

* **Icon Changes:** The logo icon was changed multiple times.  Initially a `TruckIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` was used, later replaced by `FaTruckFast` from `react-icons/fa6`, and this icon was also style-adjusted with `-scale-x-100` to flip the icon.

* **Component Refactoring (Major Change):** A substantial refactoring took place around 1:14 PM. The login/signup toggle was replaced with a state variable `viewMode` allowing the component to render three distinct views: 'login', 'signup', and 'forgot' (password reset). This involved creating a `renderLogo()` function to handle consistent logo rendering. The code was restructured to use conditional rendering based on `viewMode`, making the code much cleaner and more organized.

* **Forgotten Password Functionality:** A "Forgot Password?" link was added, which eventually lead to a full forgotten password view (`viewMode === 'forgot'`) allowing a user to request a password reset.

* **Minor Changes:** There were minor changes such as removing and re-adding classes, adjusting the text of labels and buttons, and refining the styling of the signup form. The styling of the forgotten password section was also improved.


The core functionality—handling form submissions with `FormData` and using `react-hot-toast` for feedback—remained consistent throughout all the changes.  The simple hardcoded login ("admin@gmail.com", "12345") was not altered.


## 2:45:30 PM
The log shows two revisions of `LoginPage.tsx`, both on August 7th, 2025.  The primary change between the two revisions (2:26:14 PM and 2:26:51 PM) is a minor update to the styling within the `renderLogo` function.  Specifically, the class `text-gray-800` was  modified to `page-title` for the `nvosys` span element within the logo.

The `LoginPage.tsx` file implements a login page with functionality for login, signup, and password reset. It uses React components for styling and form handling, including a custom input box, checkbox, button, and select box. The login logic currently uses hardcoded credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") for demonstration purposes.  No other files were modified in the provided log.
