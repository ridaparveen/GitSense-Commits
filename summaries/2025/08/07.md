# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 10:44:20 AM
The primary change involves the `auth.ts` file on August 6th, 2025 at 11:10:36 PM.  This commit integrates NextAuth.js for authentication, using GitHub as a provider and Prisma as the adapter.  The code utilizes environment variables (`AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_SECRET`) for sensitive configuration details.  The `NextAuth` function is destructured to export `auth`, `handlers`, `signIn`, and `signOut`.  A `console.log` statement confirms the availability of the GitHub client ID from environment variables.  The core update focuses on setting up authentication and authorization within the application.

The log shows a series of edits to `LoginPage.tsx`, a React component responsible for a login page.  The changes span from approximately 11:55 AM to 12:44 PM on August 7th, 2025.

Initially, the component used Material UI (`@mui/material`) for styling and layout, employing a `Grid` system to divide the page into two sections (login form and an image).  Over time, the Material UI components were progressively replaced with Tailwind CSS classes (`className`), resulting in a cleaner and more concise layout. This shift is evident in the removal of the `Grid` and `Box` components and their associated `styles` object.  The final version uses a single `div` for the main container with Tailwind classes for styling.

Between 11:56:01 AM and 11:58:58 AM, the right-hand side image was commented out, simplifying the layout to focus solely on the login form.

Further changes involved modifying the styling and structure of the login form itself. The heading changed from "Login To Your Account" to "Sign in to your account".  The `InputBox` component was updated, and  commented out lines of code suggest the progressive removal of unused components and features.  A `SelectBox` component was added for country selection in the signup form. The initial hardcoded login credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") remained unchanged.  Finally, a conditional rendering was implemented using a state variable `isLogin` to switch between login and signup forms, making the final version a single component capable of handling both login and signup functionalities.  The signup form includes a checkbox for email updates.  The logo was initially shown using an `img` tag, but later the tag and surrounding elements were commented out. A `TruckIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` was then introduced as a new logo.

The changes show a transition from a Material UI based layout to a Tailwind CSS based layout, suggesting a potential change in the preferred styling framework for the project. The overall evolution of the code indicates improved organization and a move towards a more streamlined and user-friendly design.
