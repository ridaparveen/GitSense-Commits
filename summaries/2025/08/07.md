# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 10:44:20 AM
The primary change involves the `auth.ts` file on August 6th, 2025 at 11:10:36 PM.  This commit integrates NextAuth.js for authentication, using GitHub as a provider and Prisma as the adapter.  The code utilizes environment variables (`AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_SECRET`) for sensitive configuration details.  The `NextAuth` function is destructured to export `auth`, `handlers`, `signIn`, and `signOut`.  A `console.log` statement confirms the availability of the GitHub client ID from environment variables.  The core update focuses on setting up authentication and authorization within the application.


## 12:46:07 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `LoginPage.tsx`, a React component responsible for a login page.  The changes span from approximately 11:55 AM to 12:44 PM on August 7th, 2025.

Initially, the component used Material UI (`@mui/material`) for styling and layout, employing a `Grid` system to divide the page into two sections (login form and an image).  Over time, the Material UI components were progressively replaced with Tailwind CSS classes (`className`), resulting in a cleaner and more concise layout. This shift is evident in the removal of the `Grid` and `Box` components and their associated `styles` object.  The final version uses a single `div` for the main container with Tailwind classes for styling.

Between 11:56:01 AM and 11:58:58 AM, the right-hand side image was commented out, simplifying the layout to focus solely on the login form.

Further changes involved modifying the styling and structure of the login form itself. The heading changed from "Login To Your Account" to "Sign in to your account".  The `InputBox` component was updated, and  commented out lines of code suggest the progressive removal of unused components and features.  A `SelectBox` component was added for country selection in the signup form. The initial hardcoded login credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") remained unchanged.  Finally, a conditional rendering was implemented using a state variable `isLogin` to switch between login and signup forms, making the final version a single component capable of handling both login and signup functionalities.  The signup form includes a checkbox for email updates.  The logo was initially shown using an `img` tag, but later the tag and surrounding elements were commented out. A `TruckIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` was then introduced as a new logo.

The changes show a transition from a Material UI based layout to a Tailwind CSS based layout, suggesting a potential change in the preferred styling framework for the project. The overall evolution of the code indicates improved organization and a move towards a more streamlined and user-friendly design.


## 1:46:15 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `LoginPage.tsx`, a React component for a login page.  The most significant changes occur between 12:47 PM and 1:23 PM on August 7th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve refactoring the UI and adding functionality for password reset.

Initially, the component displayed a simple login/signup toggle. The styling heavily relied on Tailwind CSS classes.  Over time, several changes were made:

* **Styling Changes:**  The initial styling was refined throughout the edits.  The outer container's styling changed multiple times, moving from using `div` elements with a variety of Tailwind classes for positioning and sizing to  a more consistent use of  `className="w-full max-w-md p-8 mx-auto"`  to centrally position and size the login form.  Margin adjustments were also made to the outer container (`my-6`, `m-10`, `m-15`, `m-18`, `m-20`).  Some internal styling changes were made to the logo and heading sections, primarily involving the removal of extra div containers.

* **Icon Changes:** The logo icon was changed multiple times.  Initially a `TruckIcon` from `@heroicons/react/16/solid` was used, later replaced by `FaTruckFast` from `react-icons/fa6`, and this icon was also style-adjusted with `-scale-x-100` to flip the icon.

* **Component Refactoring (Major Change):** A substantial refactoring took place around 1:14 PM. The login/signup toggle was replaced with a state variable `viewMode` allowing the component to render three distinct views: 'login', 'signup', and 'forgot' (password reset). This involved creating a `renderLogo()` function to handle consistent logo rendering. The code was restructured to use conditional rendering based on `viewMode`, making the code much cleaner and more organized.

* **Forgotten Password Functionality:** A "Forgot Password?" link was added, which eventually lead to a full forgotten password view (`viewMode === 'forgot'`) allowing a user to request a password reset.

* **Minor Changes:** There were minor changes such as removing and re-adding classes, adjusting the text of labels and buttons, and refining the styling of the signup form. The styling of the forgotten password section was also improved.


The core functionality—handling form submissions with `FormData` and using `react-hot-toast` for feedback—remained consistent throughout all the changes.  The simple hardcoded login ("admin@gmail.com", "12345") was not altered.


## 2:45:30 PM
The log shows two revisions of `LoginPage.tsx`, both on August 7th, 2025.  The primary change between the two revisions (2:26:14 PM and 2:26:51 PM) is a minor update to the styling within the `renderLogo` function.  Specifically, the class `text-gray-800` was  modified to `page-title` for the `nvosys` span element within the logo.

The `LoginPage.tsx` file implements a login page with functionality for login, signup, and password reset. It uses React components for styling and form handling, including a custom input box, checkbox, button, and select box. The login logic currently uses hardcoded credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") for demonstration purposes.  No other files were modified in the provided log.


## 4:28:23 PM
The log shows multiple updates to several files between 2:48 PM and 3:31 PM on August 7, 2025.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\common\CollapsibleTable.tsx` underwent several revisions.  The most significant change was replacing the `@mui/material/Checkbox` import with a custom `Checkbox` component from `@components/kit/checkbox` at 2:51:09 PM.  Minor changes involved the styling of the `AddCircle` icons within the `CollapsibleTableRow` component, where the class 'text-primary' was briefly replaced with 'page-title' and then reverted to 'page-title' again in subsequent commits.


`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\enquiry\EnquiryDashboard.tsx` was updated multiple times between 2:53 PM and 3:11 PM. These changes primarily focused on refining the UI of the Enquiry Dashboard.  Specifically, the width of certain columns in the `CollapsibleTable` was adjusted, enhancing the layout and readability of the table. The `enableCheckbox` prop of the `CollapsibleTable` was changed from `true` to `false` at 2:54:07 PM.


`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\enquiry\EnquiryForm.tsx`  experienced numerous small updates to its styling between 2:56 PM and 3:04 PM. These revisions involved the styling of elements within the `<PageWrapper.Right>` component, primarily adjusting spacing and applying Tailwind CSS classes like `space-y-1`, `text-sm`, `leading-tight`, `space-x-1`, `space-x-2`, `mt-1`, and `checkbox-title` to improve the visual presentation of the customer service and sales person information. The `h6` tag was used in various commits to change the styling for Customer service and Sales person.


`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\data\coulms\booking-coulmns.tsx` was modified between 3:14 PM and 3:17 PM. The main alteration involved changing how the "Action" column is rendered.  Initially, a custom `renderActionsCell` was used; this was later replaced with a standard `renderCell` function, simplifying the column definition. The `width` of some columns was also adjusted.  The  `renderCell` function for the "Action" column remained consistent, displaying a "Track" button. The alignment for action column was also changed several times.


`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\pages\booking\BookingDetailsPage.tsx` received a couple of updates between 3:22 PM and 3:24 PM. The changes here primarily involved restructuring the styling within the `<PageWrapper.Right>` section, using Tailwind CSS classes to organize the display of "Customer Service" and "Sales Person" information, similar to the changes made to `EnquiryForm.tsx`.


`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\Booking\BookingDetails.tsx`  underwent a single update at 3:31:57 PM.  This update removed unnecessary comments from the code, resulting in a cleaner and more concise component.  The changes made the code more readable by removing commented out code lines.


In summary, the majority of the changes revolved around UI refinements using Tailwind CSS,  component import updates, and minor code cleanup.  The most substantial code change was the replacement of the Mui Checkbox with a custom component in `CollapsibleTable.tsx`. The time between 2:53 PM and 3:04 PM shows consistent updates on the Enquiry form page.  The updates on the booking-coulmns.tsx and BookingDetailsPage.tsx file show consistent adjustments on the UI and styling.
