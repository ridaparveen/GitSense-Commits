# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 11:50:21 AM
The log shows two commits to `LoginPage.tsx` within a short time frame (8/14/2025, between 11:11:39 AM and 11:13:22 AM).  Both commits contain nearly identical code for a React login page with login, signup, and forgot password functionalities. The only difference is in the `<h1>` tag within the login section. The first commit uses the class `page-title mb-8` while the second commit uses `text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-8`.  This suggests a minor styling adjustment was made to the login header.  The component uses various React components for input, buttons, and styling, along with form handling and routing using `react-router-dom` and toast notifications.  The code includes placeholder credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") for testing purposes.
