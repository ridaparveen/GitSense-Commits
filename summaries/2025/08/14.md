# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 11:50:21 AM
The log shows two commits to `LoginPage.tsx` within a short time frame (8/14/2025, between 11:11:39 AM and 11:13:22 AM).  Both commits contain nearly identical code for a React login page with login, signup, and forgot password functionalities. The only difference is in the `<h1>` tag within the login section. The first commit uses the class `page-title mb-8` while the second commit uses `text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-8`.  This suggests a minor styling adjustment was made to the login header.  The component uses various React components for input, buttons, and styling, along with form handling and routing using `react-router-dom` and toast notifications.  The code includes placeholder credentials ("admin@gmail.com" and "12345") for testing purposes.

On August 14, 2025, at 1:38:57 PM, the `data.ts` file was updated.  This file contains data for a dashboard, structured as an array of `OverviewItem` objects. Each `OverviewItem` includes a title, a numerical value, optional change data, background and icon colors, and an icon (from various icon libraries including MUI and React Icons).

The update involved modifying the data displayed for various categories, including:

* **Enquiries:**  Showing changes in Total Open, New, Average Resolution Time, and Total Closed Enquiries.
* **Bookings:** Displaying data for New, Approved, and Cancelled Bookings, with changes indicated.
* **MBLs (Master Bills of Lading):** Presenting data on New Booked, In Transit, Pending Delivery, and Completed MBLs, showing changes.
* **Customers:** Showing data for Total, Active, and Inactive Customers, including changes.
* **Vessels:** Displaying data for Total, Active, and Inactive Vessels.
* **Vessel Voyages:**  Presenting data on Total, Active, and Inactive Voyages.
* **Vendors:** Showing data for Total, Active, and Inactive Vendors.
* **Invoices:**  Displaying data for Total Invoiced Amount, Total Outstanding Amount, Invoices Due, and Paid Invoices, with changes and comparison text (e.g., "more vs target").
* **Carting:** Showing data for Pending, In Transit, and Delivered Carts.
* **Line Bookings:**  Showing data for Confirmed, Cancelled, In Progress, and Completed Bookings.
* **Stuffing:**  Presenting data on Stuffing Volume, Stuffing Efficiency, Capacity Utilization, and Stuffing Error Rate.
* **Procurement:** Displaying data for Total Containers Procured, Procurement Cost, On-Time Delivery Rate, and Procurement Cycle Time, with changes and comparison text.
* **Box Plan:** Displaying data for Total Boxes Consumed, Packing Cost, Average Void Space, and Right-Sizing Efficiency, with changes and comparison text.

A recurring pattern is the use of consistent color schemes (`bgColor` and `iconColor`) across different data categories, often using a similar palette across related data sections.  Many data points include a `changes` field showing the numerical difference from a previous value.  Furthermore, several data categories (Invoices, Procurement, and Box Plan) include `comparisonText` providing contextual information for the changes.  The file uses a variety of icon libraries, indicating a potential preference for flexibility in icon selection.
