# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 1:02:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CollapsibleTable.tsx` between 12:02 PM and 12:11 PM on August 13, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments within the component.  The changes involved minor tweaks to color codes within `tableCellHeadSx` and `typographySx` variables.  Specifically, the color values for table header text (`tableCellHeadSx`) were modified several times, cycling between `text.primary`, `#71717A`, `#417171` and back to `#71717A`.  No significant functional changes are observed in `CollapsibleTable.tsx` during this period.

A separate set of changes were made to `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` between 12:16 PM and 12:21 PM on the same day. These modifications centered around the UI enhancements and the addition of a search functionality.  The `InformationCircleIcon` within the `detailColumns` array in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` was changed from the Material UI icon to a `HiInformationCircle` icon from the `react-icons/hi` library.  A search bar was implemented using  `InputBox` and `MagnifyingGlassIcon` components to filter the enquiry data displayed in the `CollapsibleTable`.  The filtering applies to "Enquiry No.", "Pick-Up-Location", "Customer", and "Status" fields.  The changes also show an addition of an excel export button that uses `generateExcel` utility function.  There was no change in the underlying data handling logic or the functionality of the `CollapsibleTable` itself.
