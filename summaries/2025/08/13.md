# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 1:02:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CollapsibleTable.tsx` between 12:02 PM and 12:11 PM on August 13, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments within the component.  The changes involved minor tweaks to color codes within `tableCellHeadSx` and `typographySx` variables.  Specifically, the color values for table header text (`tableCellHeadSx`) were modified several times, cycling between `text.primary`, `#71717A`, `#417171` and back to `#71717A`.  No significant functional changes are observed in `CollapsibleTable.tsx` during this period.

A separate set of changes were made to `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` between 12:16 PM and 12:21 PM on the same day. These modifications centered around the UI enhancements and the addition of a search functionality.  The `InformationCircleIcon` within the `detailColumns` array in `EnquiryDashboard.tsx` was changed from the Material UI icon to a `HiInformationCircle` icon from the `react-icons/hi` library.  A search bar was implemented using  `InputBox` and `MagnifyingGlassIcon` components to filter the enquiry data displayed in the `CollapsibleTable`.  The filtering applies to "Enquiry No.", "Pick-Up-Location", "Customer", and "Status" fields.  The changes also show an addition of an excel export button that uses `generateExcel` utility function.  There was no change in the underlying data handling logic or the functionality of the `CollapsibleTable` itself.


## 1:28:37 PM
The `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file underwent several revisions on August 13th, 2025.  The primary function, `updateEtdAndEta`, updates ETD and ETA values in the `agent_booking_routing` table based on data from `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry` tables.  The process involves several checks and skip conditions:

* **Initial Version (12:29:26 PM):**  The code fetched `agent_booking_id`, `mblno`, and `blno` from `agent_booking_entry`. It skipped records if `agent_booking_id` was missing or both `mblno` and `blno` were missing. It also skipped inactive shipments and those without ETD/ETA data in `mtr_tracking_data` or `agent_booking_routing`.  Updated records were logged.  An audit log was created using the `insertAudit` function.

* **Version 2 & 3 (12:29:48 PM & 12:30:11 PM):** These versions introduced a `username` field to the `SELECT` statement in `updateEtdAndEta`, retrieving it from `agent_booking_entry`.  However, this `username` field was not consistently used across the code, making it a temporary and ineffective addition. Version 3 reverted to the original state, removing the `username` field from the query in `updateEtdAndEta`.

* **Version 4 & 5 (12:30:27 PM & 12:31:05 PM):** The `username` field was re-added to the `SELECT` statement in `updateEtdAndEta` and used in the `insertAudit` function as `created_by`.  Version 5 made minor modifications in the `insertAudit` function arguments which doesn't affect the functionality.  There were some inconsistencies in how `agent_booking_id` was passed to `insertAudit`.


* **Final Versions (1:17:22 PM & 1:17:44 PM):** These versions are similar.  The `username` field is consistently retrieved and used in the `insertAudit` function. The most notable change is in the logging of updated records,  adding the `mblno` to the log message in the final version.  The log message for updated records now clearly shows both the agent booking ID and MBL number.


Throughout all versions, the code maintained the core logic of updating ETD/ETA, handling various skip conditions, and logging statistics. The `insertAudit` function consistently logs database updates.  The primary evolution involves the inclusion and final consistent use of the `username` field for audit trail purposes.  The addition of the MBL number to the log message in the final version improves logging clarity.


## 2:28:37 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\cng-batches\cng-batches\modules\isf\isf.shipdateupdate.js` on August 13, 2025.  The file is a Node.js module responsible for updating Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) data for ISF shipments.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions:  it retrieves shipment data, fetches corresponding MTR (presumably Master Tracking Record) data, updates ETD and ETA in the `agent_booking_routing` table, and logs the changes in an `isf_audit_log` table.  The code handles various scenarios where updates might be skipped (missing IDs, no MTR data, inactive shipments, missing ETD/ETA, etc.), providing logging for each case.  An email notification is sent upon error.

The only discernible changes between revisions are minor:

* **Between the first and second revisions (2:11:03 PM and 2:11:46 PM):** A subtle change in the logging of `newETD` and `newETA` values. In the first revision, a simple `logger.info("etadate===:",newETD,newETA)` was present. This was changed to `logger.info(`etadate===:,${newETD},${newETA}`) in the second revision, adding backticks to allow variable interpolation.

* **Between the second and third, and third and fourth revisions (2:11:46 PM, 2:15:28 PM and 2:15:46 PM):** The only change is removing the `logger.info` statement that displays `etadate===:,${newETD},${newETA}`.  This suggests a debugging statement was removed during these edits.

The overall structure and functionality of the code remain unchanged. The updates seem focused on minor logging adjustments and likely debugging activities.  The consistent timestamps suggest rapid iteration and testing during the development process.


## 3:46:57 PM
The log shows changes to environment variables in a `.env` file.  The timestamp of the single entry is 8/13/2025, 2:55:00 PM.  The file contains various configuration settings, including database credentials (DB_USER, DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_PORT), JWT secret, salt rounds for password hashing, email configuration (EMAIL_SERVICE, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS, EMAIL_FROM, EMAIL_TO, EMAIL_SUBJECT),  paths to XML files and CSV directories (CNG_INV_XML_PATH, ISF_XML_DESC_FILE_PATH, SPR_ALC_CSV_DIRECTORY, ISF_RECEIVED_XML, DOC_UPLOAD_PATH),  credentials for external services (CNG_USER_NAME, CNG_PASSWORD, CNG_SENT_XML_URL, DESC_USER_name, DESC_PASSWORD, DESC_SENT_XML_URL), and Auth0 configuration (AUTH0_DOMAIN, AUTH0_CLIENT_ID).  Many of these settings appear related to batch processing of XML and CSV files, likely for integration with external systems.  Note that several commented-out Auth0 configuration options are present. The updated Auth0 configuration uses a different domain and client ID.


## 5:28:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `isf.shipdateupdate.js` file, focusing on an ETD/ETA update process.  The initial versions (8/13/2025, 3:07:36 PM - 3:16:33 PM)  involved iterating through shipments, fetching data from `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_routing` tables, updating ETA and ETD fields in `agent_booking_routing`, and logging various statistics.  The logic for fetching `mtr_tracking_data` evolved, starting with `LIMIT 1` and then incorporating `ORDER BY departure_date DESC NULLS LAST` or `ORDER BY lastmodifieddate DESC LIMIT 1` to prioritize more recent data.  There were also many iterations where audit log insertion was either commented out or fully implemented.

Around 8/13/2025, 3:57:13 PM a significant change occurred. The `updateEtdAndEta` function was extensively refactored to handle multiple MTR rows for a single booking, which is more robust in the face of potentially multiple entries in `mtr_tracking_data`.  The code now processes each matching row, checking for inactive shipments and updating accordingly. The changes made around this time also improve handling of null values and date comparisons using `toISOString()`.  The final version (8/13/2025, 5:28:22 PM) uses `mtrDataRows` for efficient handling of multiple rows obtained from `mtr_tracking_data`, improving the logic to prevent errors when `mtrDataRows` is empty.  The code also ensures that only the changed ETD/ETA values are logged in the audit log, for efficiency.  The condition for skipping shipments was also changed from `!mtrData.t49_vessel_actualarrived_date && !mtrData.vessel_actualarrived_date` to `!mtrData.t49_vessel_actualarrived_date || !mtrData.vessel_actualarrived_date` clarifying the condition for active shipments.

The `config.js` file (8/13/2025, 2:54:41 PM) contains configuration settings for database connections (development and production environments), file paths for various data sources, integration details for CNG, email configurations, and SFTP settings.  The file's most significant change was defining configurations for both 'development' and 'production' environments with different parameters, such as database credentials and file paths.


## 6:46:56 PM
The log shows two entries for the `.env` file at `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\.env`,  recorded at 8/13/2025, 6:45:26 PM and 8/13/2025, 6:45:57 PM.  The content of the file is identical in both entries.  The file contains various environment variables, including database credentials, JWT secret, email settings, file paths (for XML files, CSV files, and uploads), and credentials for external services (like CNG and DESC).  There are no changes between the two timestamps; the file's content remains consistent.  The file uses commented-out Auth0 settings, indicating a potential shift in authentication methods.  The configuration includes settings for both development and potentially production environments (implied by the presence of various URLs).
