# Activity Summary for 2/23/2026

## 9:09:46 AM
The changes primarily revolve around a refactoring of the PDF generation process for Importer Security Filings (ISF), transitioning from an HTML-to-PDF approach to a direct PDF rendering using the `pdfkit` library.

The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\IsfPdfGenerator.ts`, updated on 2/16/2026, 6:36:20 PM, defines the `IsfPdfTemplate` class. This class is responsible for assembling the content of an ISF PDF based on `ISFQueryType` data. It includes utility methods like `sanitize` for cleaning input values, `tilde` for combining values, and `formatAddress` for constructing address strings. The `generate` method orchestrates the PDF creation by using a `PdfKitGenerator` instance to add a logo, blue title bars, various section bars (Header, Parties, Commodity Details), and structured data blocks. It dynamically renders different "Parties" sections and a "Commodity Details" table based on whether the `isf_type` is 'ISF10' or 'ISF5'. A significant detail in this file is the extensive commented-out section, which appears to be a previous implementation that generated PDFs from an HTML template, indicating a complete shift in the underlying PDF generation mechanism.

The related file, `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\utils\ISFkitPdfGenerator.ts`, updated shortly after on 2/16/2026, 6:41:20 PM, introduces the `PdfKitGenerator` class. This class acts as a wrapper around the `pdfkit` library, providing a set of higher-level methods to construct the visual layout of a PDF document. It includes functionalities to:
*   Initialize a `PDFDocument` with customizable size and margins.
*   Add styled section bars (gray background) and blue title bars with main and optional subtitles.
*   Render complex `addTwoColumnBlock` layouts, which dynamically calculate row heights, handle page breaks, and apply specific border styling for label-value pairs.
*   Incorporate a logo, simple titles, and individual fields.
*   Generate a structured `addTable` with headers and rows, featuring colored headers, distinct vertical dividers (solid in the center, dotted for inner columns), and dynamic content placement.
*   Manage vertical spacing.
*   Asynchronously collect and return the PDF as a Buffer.

The key pattern evident from these changes is a systematic refactoring of the PDF generation logic from a potentially less performant or harder-to-control HTML-to-PDF conversion to a more robust, programmatic PDF rendering using the `pdfkit` library. The close timestamps of the two file updates suggest these changes were part of a single, coordinated development effort to implement this new PDF generation architecture, focusing on a modular design where `IsfPdfTemplate` handles data mapping and `PdfKitGenerator` provides the drawing primitives. Consistent data sanitization and structured document layouts are recurring elements across the implementation.

The primary changes observed across the logs involve configuration adjustments and refinements to an email notification module.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\Documents\Office\cng-batches\cng-batches\config\config.js`**:
    *   This configuration file defines `development` and `production` settings for database connections, numerous file paths for various batch processing (XML, Excel, CSV for ISF, CLB, CNG, SPR, FDA, Anchor, OTM), integration credentials, extensive email recipient lists for different reports and notifications, SFTP configurations, and API keys for services like T49, geolocation, and Lune.
    *   Changes throughout the timestamps primarily involve updating local file paths within the `development` environment (e.g., `googleTokenPath`, `mtrDataUploadFromXlsx`) to reflect a specific user's directory (`C:/Users/ridap/Documents/Office/...`).
    *   There were also frequent modifications to email recipient lists in the `development` environment for various reports (e.g., `execptionMailList`, `isf24HrReport`, `anchor24HrJsonReport`, `isfNotMatchReport`, `openFileEmail`). Some email addresses were added or changed to `rida@dyneinfotech.com` or `awadheshmaurya563@gmail.com` for testing or specific user assignment. The `userRegistrationApproval.cc` setting was toggled between being commented out and active.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\Documents\Office\cng-batches\cng-batches\modules\login-req-notify\nofifyAdmin.js`**:
    *   This file introduces a `NotifyAdmin` class responsible for managing new user registration notifications.
    *   It fetches new users with a `NEW` status, sends an initial registration email to a general `config.email.all` list, increments an `emailcounter` for each user, and identifies "eligible" users who have been notified at least twice (`emailcounter >= 2`) and haven't yet received an approval email.
    *   For these eligible users, it sends a follow-up email requesting "Additional Information Required for Your Registration Approval," including specific details like shipment and container numbers, and directs them to contact a support team.
    *   The database is updated to mark users as `approval_email_sent` after the second email.
    *   **Significant functional changes occurred in this file**:
        *   Initial implementations of email sending to individual eligible users involved simple mapping (`sendEmailTo.map(...)`).
        *   This was later refined to iterate through recipients to send individual emails (`for (const email of recipients)`).
        *   The most notable functional improvement was at **2/23/2026, 12:52:13 PM**, where the logic for determining `recipients` for the second approval email was changed from a simple map to a more robust `flatMap` approach. This enhancement allows the system to correctly parse and send separate emails to multiple addresses if a user's `emailid` field contains comma-separated values.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/23/2026, 12:20:05 PM (config.js)**: Establishes a comprehensive configuration baseline with initial changes to paths and email recipients.
*   **2/23/2026, 12:26:12 PM (nofifyAdmin.js)**: Marks the introduction of the `NotifyAdmin` class and its core email notification and user approval workflow.
*   **2/23/2026, 12:32:57 PM (nofifyAdmin.js)**: Implements an iteration loop for sending individual approval emails to eligible users.
*   **2/23/2026, 12:52:13 PM (nofifyAdmin.js)**: Introduces a more sophisticated method (`flatMap` with splitting and trimming) for handling multiple email addresses in a single user record, ensuring correct delivery to all specified recipients.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:

*   **Environment-Specific Configurations**: The `config.js` file consistently distinguishes between `development` and `production` environments, each having its own set of database credentials, file paths, and external service configurations. This is a standard pattern for managing application settings across different deployment stages.
*   **Path Management**: There is a heavy reliance on absolute file paths, especially for various XML, Excel, and CSV inputs/outputs, and their respective archive locations. Changes frequently involved adjusting these paths, particularly for a local development setup.
*   **Extensive Emailing**: Email notifications are a critical recurring element, with specific lists and templates for various events such as new user registrations, daily reports (e.g., `isf24HrReport`, `anchor24HrJsonReport`), error reports (`execptionMailList`), and user registration approvals. This indicates a system that relies heavily on email communication for operational updates and user interaction.
*   **Iterative Code Refinement**: The `nofifyAdmin.js` file shows a clear pattern of iterative development. Initial implementations are followed by small adjustments and then more significant functional improvements, particularly in how email recipients are processed to handle edge cases (e.g., multiple email addresses in a single field).
*   **Logging Practices**: The consistent use of `logger.info` and `console.log` statements throughout `nofifyAdmin.js` indicates a focus on tracing the application's flow and data states, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
*   **Sensitive Data Handling**: The configuration file contains numerous credentials (database, SFTP, API keys, email passwords), reflecting a pattern of centralizing sensitive information.

## 2:16:45 PM
The changes primarily focus on database operations, schema management, and environment variable handling.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`scripts\add-constraint-migration.js` (2/23/2026, 11:50:49 AM):** This file was initially created as a JavaScript migration script. Its purpose is to add a unique constraint named `onboarddetails_unique_key` to the `onboarddetails` table, ensuring uniqueness across the `containerno`, `vessel`, and `voyage` columns. It includes logic to check if the constraint already exists before attempting to add it.
*   **`scripts\add-constraint-migration.ts` (2/23/2026, 11:58:07 AM - 2/23/2026, 12:10:21 PM):** Shortly after the `.js` version, a TypeScript equivalent was introduced. This `.ts` file performs the exact same database migration logic, adapting the script to TypeScript syntax. A notable change occurred at **12:04:09 PM** where `import "dotenv/config";` was added to ensure environment variables were loaded, but this import was subsequently removed at **12:10:21 PM**.
*   **`src\common\util\database.ts` (2/23/2026, 12:01:38 PM - 2/23/2026, 12:05:32 PM):** This core database utility file saw significant enhancements.
    *   At **12:01:38 PM**, a new `insertMany` function was added to support bulk insertion of multiple records into a table. The existing `insertQuery` and `updateQuery` functions were modified to incorporate `process.env.DB_SCHEMA`, prefixing table names with the database schema for better organization. A `console.log` for `DB_PASSWORD` was also added.
    *   At **12:04:36 PM**, additional `console.log` statements for `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` were inserted, likely for debugging purposes.
    *   At **12:05:32 PM**, `import "dotenv/config";` was added at the top of the file, explicitly loading environment variables for the database connection pool.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database Schema Management:** There's a clear emphasis on database schema and data integrity, highlighted by the creation of a migration script to add a unique constraint and the integration of `DB_SCHEMA` into database query functions.
*   **TypeScript Adoption:** The quick transition from a `.js` to a `.ts` migration script, along with updates to an existing `.ts` database utility file, suggests a preference for or ongoing migration to TypeScript within the project.
*   **Environment Variable Configuration:** The repeated additions and removals of `import "dotenv/config";` in the migration script and the database utility, combined with explicit `console.log` statements for database credentials (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`), indicate active debugging or refinement of the environment variable loading mechanism to ensure database connections are correctly established.
*   **Improved Data Operations:** The introduction of the `insertMany` function demonstrates a push for more efficient handling of data, particularly for scenarios requiring the insertion of multiple records.
