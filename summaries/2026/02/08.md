# Activity Summary for 2/8/2026

## 2:04:51 PM
The changes log details a series of modifications to two files related to analytics, primarily focusing on a CBM (Cubic Meter) reporting service and associated utility functions. All recorded changes occurred on **2/6/2026**.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\cbmService.ts`

This file underwent the most frequent updates, all within a few hours (2:25 PM to 5:03 PM).

*   **Initial Setup (2:25:59 PM):** The `getCBMReports` function was initially structured to generate CBM reports based on a `group_by_column`, date range, and an `mblwise` flag. It included logic to fetch `selectedColumns` for a `customizer` object and construct a PostgreSQL `mainQuery`. The query initially filtered by a single `account_name`.
*   **Company List Implementation (2:26:45 PM - 2:28:38 PM):** A significant change was the transition from filtering by a single `account_name` (`Lower(mtd.account_name) = '${CompanyName}'`) to filtering by a list of company names (`LOWER(mtd.account_name) IN (${companyList})`). The `companyList` is generated by splitting `CompanyName` (which can contain multiple names separated by "||"), trimming, lowercasing, and joining them for use in a SQL `IN` clause. The `req` parameter type was also updated from `AuthenticatedRequest` to `IAuthReq`. A temporary duplication of `CompanyName` declaration was introduced and subsequently resolved.
*   **Minor Query/Type Adjustments (2:32:10 PM):** A small type casting change (`columnName as string` to `columnName as any`) was made within the `replaceValueInQuery` function call in the `mainQuery` construction.
*   **Extensive Column Ignoring & Debugging (3:42:02 PM):** The list of `ignore` columns passed to `getColumnsByCategory` was massively expanded to include numerous fields like `booking_status`, `ar_charge`, `inv_date`, `inland_eta`, `trucker`, `completed_date`, and various rail/vessel dates. This suggests a refinement of which columns are relevant or should be excluded from general reports. Debugging `console.log` and `logger.info` statements were added to trace `columnName` and `mainQuery`.
*   **`mblwise` Customizer Integration (3:53:31 PM - 4:01:37 PM):** An attempt was made to add an `mblwise` property to the `customizer` object. It was initially set dynamically, then briefly hardcoded to `true` (3:54:15 PM), and finally removed from the `customizer` object (4:01:37 PM). This indicates experimentation with exposing query parameters to the client-side customizer.
*   **`mblwiseCondition` Refinement (4:05:06 PM - 5:03:57 PM):** The `mblwiseCondition` logic was adjusted. For `mblwise === "true"`, the `groupBy` property, which was originally `, mblno`, was first left active and then explicitly commented out (5:03:36 PM), effectively making the `groupBy` an empty string for the `mblwise` condition. Subsequently, the `GROUP BY entity ${mblwiseCondition.groupBy}` clause in the generic `mainQuery` construction (the `else` block) was simplified to `GROUP BY entity` (5:03:57 PM), removing the dynamic `mblwiseCondition.groupBy` altogether from the query string. This suggests a shift in how MBL-wise grouping is handled in the final SQL, likely relying solely on `DISTINCT ON (mblno)` without an explicit `GROUP BY` on `mblno`. Additional `console.log` statements were added for debugging `mblwiseCondition`.

### File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`

This file saw fewer, but notable, changes within a shorter timeframe (2:33 PM to 2:33 PM), primarily focused on type definitions and export column lists.

*   **Type Strictness and Export Column Expansion (2:33:01 PM):** The `replaceValueInQuery` function's `columnName` parameter was explicitly typed as `string`, and `getUserObject` was made more type-strict, expecting `UserType` and returning `Promise<UserType>`. The `dateKeys` array in `dateFilterOnExport` was significantly extended with many new date-related fields. The `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array, however, appeared truncated at the end of the log entry.
*   **Type Reversions and Column Extension (2:33:09 PM - 2:33:44 PM):** The type strictness changes for `replaceValueInQuery` (`string` reverted to `string | any`) and `getUserObject` (simplified from `UserType` and `Promise<UserType>` to `any` and implicit `Promise<unknown>`) were largely reversed. The `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array continued to be extended in stages, adding more column definitions like `t49_empty_return_date`, `empty_return_date`, `contno_out_gated`, and `t49_contno_out_gated`, but remained truncated at the end of each log entry, suggesting it was still in the process of being defined or there was a logging issue.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Continuous Refinement:** The log indicates ongoing development and debugging, characterized by rapid, iterative changes to query logic, parameter handling, and column selections.
*   **Company Name Flexibility:** A clear pattern is the enhancement of company name filtering in SQL queries, moving from a single company to supporting multiple companies, suggesting a feature to allow broader data aggregation.
*   **Debugging Focus:** The frequent addition of `logger.info` and `console.log` statements throughout `cbmService.ts` highlights active debugging efforts during this development period.
*   **Type Fluctuations:** In `analytics.ts`, there was an interesting back-and-forth on type strictness for `replaceValueInQuery` and `getUserObject`, implying internal discussion or experimentation with TypeScript usage.
*   **Incomplete Log Entries:** The `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array in `analytics.ts` consistently appears truncated, which might be a logging artifact rather than an actual code change.

## 3:04:47 PM
The changes log primarily details modifications to two files: `cbmService.ts` and `analytics.ts`, both located within the `t360-backend-v2/src` directory. All changes occurred on **February 6, 2026**, indicating a concentrated development or debugging session.

### File: `cbmService.ts`

This file is responsible for fetching CBM (Cubic Meter) reports.
*   **Early Changes (2/6/2026, 2:25:59 PM - 2:28:50 PM):**
    *   The primary SQL queries (`mainQuery`) were modified to allow filtering by multiple company names. Initially, they used `Lower(mtd.account_name) = '${CompanyName}'`.
    *   By **2:26:45 PM**, this was updated to `LOWER(mtd.account_name) IN (${companyList})` for both country-specific and general CBM reports.
    *   A significant structural change at **2:28:38 PM** introduced the logic to parse `CompanyName` (which could be a `||`-separated string) into a `companyList` array of quoted, lowercased company names. This `companyList` is used in the SQL `IN` clause. This change also corrected the `getCBMReports` function signature to use `IAuthReq` and removed a redundant `CompanyName` declaration.
    *   A minor cleanup at **2:28:50 PM** removed the duplicate `CompanyName` declaration.
*   **Mid-Session Changes (2/6/2026, 2:32:10 PM - 2:34:04 PM):**
    *   A minor TypeScript type assertion change occurred at **2:32:10 PM** in the `replaceValueInQuery` call, casting `columnName` to `string`. The entry at **2:34:04 PM** shows no functional differences, likely a re-save.
*   **Later Changes (2/6/2026, 3:42:02 PM - 5:03:57 PM):**
    *   **3:42:02 PM** brought substantial updates to the `ignore` list for `getColumnsByCategory`. Numerous columns related to booking, charges, dates, rail, and vessel information were added to this list, suggesting a refinement of which columns are relevant for CBM reports. Debugging `console.log` statements were also introduced (`*********start cbm*******`, `====coulmnname====`, `====mainQuery====`). The `user` object was explicitly cast to `UserType`, and a `replaceValueInQuery` parameter was loosely typed as `any`.
    *   At **3:53:31 PM**, the `customizer` object was updated to include the `mblwise` parameter, indicating whether the report is mbl-wise.
    *   A temporary change at **3:54:15 PM** hardcoded `mblwise: true` in the `customizer`, which was quickly reverted at **4:01:37 PM** to dynamically reflect the request parameter.
    *   More debugging `console.log` statements (`====mblwiseCondition====`) were added at **4:05:06 PM**.
    *   **5:03:36 PM** and **5:03:57 PM** involve changes to the `mblwiseCondition` and the main SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause. Specifically, the `groupBy: `, mblno`,` part of `mblwiseCondition` was commented out (and later removed from interpolation), which, given the inner `SELECT DISTINCT ON (mblno) mblno AS entity`, effectively streamlined the `GROUP BY` clause without changing its functional output for `mblwise` reports.

### File: `analytics.ts`

This utility file provides helper functions for analytics, including date range handling, user object retrieval, query value replacement, and column definitions for Excel exports.
*   **Rapid Iteration (2/6/2026, 2:33:01 PM - 2:33:44 PM):**
    *   The `replaceValueInQuery` function saw its `columnName` parameter type briefly tightened from `string | any` to `string` at **2:33:01 PM**, but was reverted back to `string | any` at **2:33:09 PM**.
    *   Similarly, `getUserObject` was type-hinted with `Promise<UserType>` and `user: UserType` at **2:33:01 PM**, then reverted to `any` types at **2:33:44 PM**. This indicates a fluctuation in type strictness for these utility functions.
    *   The `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array was consistently expanded across these timestamps, adding more specific shipping and tracking-related columns for data export, such as `trucker`, `contno_out_gated`, and `t49_contno_out_gated`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Multi-Company Support**: A core theme across `cbmService.ts` is the transition from single-company account filtering to supporting multiple companies via a `companyList` derived from a `||`-separated string.
*   **Dynamic SQL Generation**: Both files extensively use string interpolation to build dynamic SQL queries based on request parameters (`columnName`, `fromDate`, `toDate`, `mblwise`).
*   **Column Customization**: There's a clear focus on making which columns are displayed or ignored configurable, particularly evident in the expanded `ignore` list for `getColumnsByCategory` and the `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array.
*   **Debugging**: The presence of `logger.info` and `console.log` statements with descriptive messages (e.g., `====mainQuery====`, `*********start cbm*******`) suggests active debugging and logging of key variables during development.
*   **Type Management**: The `analytics.ts` file shows an ongoing debate or re-evaluation of TypeScript's type strictness for utility functions, with types being added and then loosened.
*   **Date Handling**: The `defaultDateRange` function and the consistent use of `departure_date >= '${fromDate}'::timestamp AND departure_date <= '${toDate}'::timestamp + INTERVAL '1 day'` in queries highlight the importance of date filtering in the analytics reports.
