# Activity Summary for 2/28/2026

## 1:54:26 PM
The log details recent changes across two core areas of the frontend application: a logout hook and a form for adding carting entries, along with its underlying option service.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\frontend\envosys-frontend\src\hook\performLogout.ts`**
- **Timestamps:** 2/27/2026, 3:50:41 PM and 2/27/2026, 3:50:51 PM
- **Key Updates:** Both entries for this file show identical code. The `performLogout` asynchronous function handles user logout, distinguishing between "manual" and "auto" reasons. It prevents duplicate logout calls using an `isLoggingOut` flag. It attempts an API call to `/api/users/logout` with the stored token and authentication type. Regardless of API success, it consistently clears user-related data from `localStorage` (token, user, authtype, lastAllowedRoute) and dispatches a Redux action to clear user state. For automatic logouts, it displays a "Session expired" toast, preventing repeat messages. Manual logouts show a "Logged out." toast and redirect to the homepage. A large, identical commented-out block of code is present at the end of the file, suggesting a previous state or a backup during development.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\frontend\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\operation\carting\AddCartingForm.tsx`**
- **Timestamps:** 2/27/2026, 5:29:15 PM, 2/27/2026, 6:05:21 PM, 2/27/2026, 6:09:54 PM, 2/27/2026, 6:35:28 PM, 2/27/2026, 6:51:56 PM, 2/27/2026, 6:52:06 PM, 2/27/2026, 6:55:53 PM
- **Key Updates:** This file underwent several iterative enhancements for the `AddCartingForm` component.
    - **Initial (5:29:15 PM):** The form was set up using Formik with fields for shipping details, dates, customer, cargo type, packages, weight, volume, and routing information. `AutocompleteSearch` was implemented for "Vessel/Voyage" and "Customer", with the former auto-filling "POL" and "POD". Date fields were configured to send `null` for empty values to the backend.
    - **6:05:21 PM:** Introduced an `AutocompleteSearch` for "Shipper" (`shipperDisplay`), adding `shipperDisplay` to the form's state interface and initial values. Initially, there was a minor error where it was setting `customer_id` instead of `shipper_id`.
    - **6:09:54 PM:** Corrected the "Shipper" `AutocompleteSearch` to set `shipper_id`. An `AutocompleteSearch` for "Consignee" (`consigneeDisplay`) was added, completing the transition for key party fields to use autocomplete.
    - **6:35:28 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.
    - **6:51:56 PM:** The "Package Type" input field was converted from a standard `InputBox` to a `SelectBox`, populated by a predefined `packageTypeOptions` array listing various units (e.g., FEET, CBM, KGS).
    - **6:52:06 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.
    - **6:55:53 PM:** Both "Routing" and "FPD" fields were upgraded from simple `InputBox` components to `AutocompleteSearch` components, using the "port" endpoint for dynamic suggestions. The selection logic for these fields extracts the port name from a `PORT_NAME~PORT_CODE` format.
- **Patterns:** A clear pattern emerges of replacing static `InputBox` components with dynamic `AutocompleteSearch` or `SelectBox` components for critical data entry fields (Vessel/Voyage, Customer, Shipper, Consignee, Package Type, Routing, FPD). This indicates a move towards improved user experience, data validation, and integration with backend lookup services. Old `InputBox` elements were often commented out rather than removed immediately.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\frontend\envosys-frontend\src\optionService.ts`**
- **Timestamps:** 2/27/2026, 5:36:25 PM, 2/27/2026, 5:37:49 PM, 2/27/2026, 5:38:26 PM, 2/27/2026, 5:38:32 PM, 2/27/2026, 5:38:57 PM, 2/27/2026, 5:42:24 PM
- **Key Updates:** This service manages static and API-fetched options for various autocomplete and select components.
    - **Initial (5:36:25 PM):** The file defines `staticOptions` for fallback values and a crucial `normalizeOption` function that transforms raw API responses into a consistent `{ value, label, serial_id, raw }` structure based on the `endpointKey`. It handles numerous specific keys like `vessel-voyage`, `port-data`, `sales-export`, and `customer-master`. The `fetchOptions` function integrates with `ApiManager` and can target different backend services (e.g., "accounts" backend).
    - **5:37:49 PM:** A `console.log` statement was added specifically for "customer-master" normalization for debugging purposes.
    - **5:38:26 PM, 5:38:32 PM, 5:38:57 PM:** The `customer-master` normalization logic in `normalizeOption` underwent rapid changes. It first attempted to use `item.nam` for the `value`, then `item.name`, and finally reverted to `item.value`. These rapid changes suggest an iterative debugging process to correctly identify the field containing the value for "customer-master" items from the backend.
    - **5:42:24 PM:** The `customer-master` normalization was finalized to be more resilient, using `item.label || item.name || ""` for the `label` and `item.value || item.name || ""` for the `value`. This flexible approach ensures that the label and value are correctly extracted even if the backend response fields vary slightly.
- **Patterns:** The `normalizeOption` function is a central utility for handling diverse API response structures, applying specific transformations based on the `endpointKey`. The multiple, quick changes to the `customer-master` normalization indicate an active debugging effort to ensure data consistency. Frequent `console.log` statements throughout `fetchOptions` and `normalizeOption` suggest a strong focus on observing and verifying data flow.

## 1:55:01 PM
The code changes reflect a significant ongoing migration and refactoring effort, primarily centered around transitioning from raw SQL queries to Prisma ORM for database interactions, standardizing environment variable loading, and enhancing server startup robustness.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\server.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 1:31 PM - 2:01 PM):** Minor adjustments and reversions of `console.log` statements.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:06 PM):** A major refactor was introduced, ensuring `config.ts` is imported first, moving file download paths to use `CONFIG` variables, and encapsulating server startup logic within an `async startServer` function. The direct `pool` import was temporarily removed, implying a shift in DB connection strategy.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:07 PM - 2:11 PM):** `pool` and a new `testConnection` utility function were reintroduced, and the `startServer` function was updated to use `testConnection` for a robust DB check before starting. Debugging `console.log` statements were added.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:04 PM - 3:19 PM):** A partial revert occurred, with the `server.ts` code returning to an earlier state, using `process.env` for file paths and `pool.connect().then().catch()` directly. `process.exit(1)` was added to terminate on DB connection failure.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:20 PM - 3:23 PM):** The file content became highly unstable, oscillating between a minimal server setup (just listening to port and basic DB connect) and a fully configured Express app with all routes and middleware. At 3:22 PM, a clean structure with `config.ts` first import, `testConnection`, and structured `try/catch` for server startup was reinstated.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:25 PM - 3:31 PM):** Debugging `console.log` statements were extensively added and removed, including logging imported modules directly. Middleware and route configurations were briefly moved *inside* the `startServer` function (an unusual pattern) before being corrected. The file download route was repeatedly commented out and uncommented.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:37 PM - 3:53 PM):** Continued fluctuating between simplified and complete versions of the `server.ts` file, with frequent additions/removals of debug logs and inconsistent presence of core middleware and route definitions. The most recent version (3:53 PM) matches a complete setup with all middleware, public/private routes, and direct `pool.connect()` DB check.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\database.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 1:32 PM - 1:56 PM):** Initial setup with `pg.Pool` using `process.env`. `dotenv.config` was explicitly added at 1:56 PM to ensure environment variables are loaded.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:03 PM):** Significant refactoring to use the centralized `CONFIG` object for database connection details instead of direct `process.env` access. Minor syntax changes in query functions.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:07 PM):** Introduced an `export const testConnection` function to standardize and improve database connection checks.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:49 PM - 3:04 PM):** Reverted back to using `process.env` directly for pool configuration and removed the `testConnection` function. A `console.log` statement for pool configuration was briefly added then commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\index.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 1:32 PM):** Added `UserRoutes` and `MenuPermissionRoutes` imports and their respective `apiRouter.use` statements. Initial `console.log` and process error handlers were present.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:32 PM):** Debugging console logs and process error handlers were removed.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:34 PM):** Briefly added `pool` and `logger` imports along with `pool.connect()` logic directly into the router file, then quickly reverted.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:40 PM - 5:02 PM):** Repeatedly commented out and uncommented various API routes (e.g., `PortRoutes`, `HblRoutes`, `CartingRoutes`, `StuffingRoutes`), indicating active development, testing, or conditional deployment of these modules.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\prisma.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:01 PM):** Initial creation of the Prisma client setup, using `PrismaPg` adapter and `CONFIG.DATABASE_URL`.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:05 PM - 3:32 PM):** Minor refactoring of how `connectionString` is passed to the `PrismaPg` adapter, including the addition and removal of a non-null assertion operator `!`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\config\config.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 1:58 PM):** Defined a `CONFIG` object to centralize environment variables. `dotenv.config` was hardcoded to a development environment file. `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` was incorrectly assigned.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 2:04 PM):** Improved environment variable loading to be environment-aware (`.env.${env}`). `DB_PORT` and `DB_SCHEMA` received default values. `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` was corrected, and new file path configurations (`UPLOAD_DOC_PATH`, etc.) were added to the `CONFIG` object.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\customer.prisma`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:35 PM):** Defined `customer` model with basic fields and relations.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:22 PM):** Added `@@index` directives for `tenant_id` and `loc_code` and an `@@map("customer_master")` to explicitly define the table name.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\tanent.prisma`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:36 PM):** Defined the `tenants` model, detailing its numerous one-to-many relationships with other core application models, including `users`, `roles`, `companies`, `JobMaster`, `VesselMaster`, `carting`, and `customer`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\core.prisma`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 3:36 PM):** Defined core authentication and organizational models, including `users`, `roles`, `companies`, `company_locations`, `user_menu`, `permissions`, and their audit tables. These models consistently incorporate multi-tenancy fields (`tenant_id`) and audit trails.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\UserService.ts`**:
    *   **(27/2/2026, 3:54 PM):** Significant refactoring of user authentication logic (`login`, `fetchUserWithDetails`, `validateUserPassword`, `updateUserLoginStatus`, `fetchUserMenus`) to use Prisma ORM instead of raw SQL queries. This involved importing `prisma` and rewriting key database access patterns. Functions like `saveNewUser`, `resetPassword`, and `setNewPassword` still largely rely on raw SQL at this stage.
    *   **(27/2/2026, 3:55 PM - 3:59 PM):** Minor additions of `console.log` for debugging within the `login` function.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\cartingService.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:02 PM):** New file created, implementing a service for Carting records. It uses Prisma extensively for `getAllCarting` (with pagination, search, filters), `getCartingByBillno`, `getPODAnalytics` (using `groupBy`), and `saveCarting`. It defines a `serializeCarting` helper for BigInt handling and includes multi-tenancy filters. A placeholder for `sendCartingEmail` exists.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 6:44 PM):** An interface `SaveCartingBody` was added for type safety, and a `toBigInt` helper function was introduced for converting string IDs to BigInt. Debugging `console.log` was added to `saveCarting`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\vesselAndVoyageService.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:11 PM):** New file created, implementing a service for Vessel and Voyage data. It primarily uses Prisma for fetching and creating records (`getAll`, `CreateVesselAndVoyage`), including complex filters, pagination, and nested relations. It still uses raw SQL `query` for fetching `document_upload` and `notes`. A `stringifyBigInts` helper is included. Multi-tenancy is applied.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:12 PM - 5:13 PM):** Minor adjustment to vessel ID validation in `CreateVesselAndVoyage`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\schema.prisma`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:20 PM):** This file defines core application labels (`notes`, `Sequence`, `port_master`) and notably contains many commented-out model definitions (e.g., `carting`, `customer`, `consignee_master`). This indicates a work-in-progress database schema definition, likely being broken down into smaller, module-specific Prisma schema files (as seen with `operations.prisma`).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\searchOptions.ts`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:20 PM):** Implemented an extensive autocomplete API using a mix of raw SQL (`OptionQuery` helper) and Prisma. It provides search options for various entities like customers, sales persons, employees, ports, vessels, voyages, vendors, commodities, and line bookings.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:24 PM):** The "party" search logic (`shipper`, `consignee`, etc.) was migrated from raw SQL to `prisma.partyMaster.findMany`, improving type safety and leveraging Prisma's capabilities.
    *   **(2/27/2026, 6:03 PM - 6:08 PM):** Minor variable name changes within the Prisma-based party search logic.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\operations.prisma`**:
    *   **(2/27/2026, 5:57 PM):** New file created, defining models related to operations: `JobMaster`, `VesselMaster`, `VesselVoyageMaster`, `VesselRouting`, and their corresponding enums. It also introduces `partyMaster` and `partyType` models, including multi-tenancy fields and relations. This modular schema approach helps manage the growing database definitions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Prisma Adoption:** The most prominent pattern is the ongoing migration from raw SQL to Prisma ORM. Many services are being rewritten to use Prisma's client, indicating a strategic shift towards a more type-safe and efficient database access layer. However, some services still retain raw SQL, suggesting a gradual transition.
*   **Multi-tenancy Implementation:** Virtually all new and updated models in Prisma schema files (e.g., `customer`, `tenants`, `core`, `operations`) include `tenant_id` and `loc_code` fields. Corresponding service logic consistently filters data based on `req.user?.tenant_id` and `req.user?.current_location_code`, highlighting a strong architectural focus on multi-tenancy and location-based data isolation.
*   **Environment Variable Standardization:** The `config.ts` file has been improved to load environment variables reliably based on `NODE_ENV` and to provide them through a single `CONFIG` object, which `server.ts` and `database.ts` now consume. This centralizes configuration management.
*   **Server Startup Robustness:** There's a recurring theme of improving the server's initialization, particularly ensuring the database connection is established and tested before the server starts listening, with explicit error handling and application termination on failure (`process.exit(1)`). The frequent changes in `server.ts` demonstrate iterative refinement in achieving this stability.
*   **BigInt Serialization:** The consistent use of helper functions like `serializeCarting` and `stringifyBigInts` indicates that PostgreSQL's `BigInt` type is used for IDs, requiring explicit conversion to string when returned in JSON responses to prevent serialization errors.
*   **Active Development & Debugging:** The numerous `console.log` statements, especially in `server.ts` and `UserService.ts`, and the frequent commenting/uncommenting of code blocks and routes in `index.ts` and `server.ts`, strongly suggest a highly active development phase with frequent testing and debugging. The "chaotic" state of `server.ts` at certain timestamps further supports this.
*   **Modular Prisma Schemas:** The introduction of `prisma/models/operations.prisma` alongside `prisma/schema.prisma` indicates a move towards modular organization of Prisma models, possibly to manage a large and complex schema more effectively.

## 2:54:32 PM
The log details recent development focusing on a frontend application, specifically related to user logout functionality and the implementation of a new "Add Carting" form, alongside enhancements to a shared option service for autocomplete and select inputs.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\frontend\envosys-frontend\src\hook\performLogout.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/27/2026, 3:50:41 PM and 2/27/2026, 3:50:51 PM.
    *   **Updates:** The `performLogout` function handles both manual and automatic logouts. It clears user-related data from `localStorage` and Redux (`userSlice`), attempts to call a backend logout API, and displays toast messages. A mechanism prevents duplicate "Session expired" toasts for auto-logout if a manual logout has already occurred. Between the two timestamps, there was no functional change to the active code; a minor cleanup involved removing an `alert("hiiiii")` statement from a commented-out block of older code within the file.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\frontend\envosys-frontend\src\components\screen\operation\carting\AddCartingForm.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Numerous changes between 2/27/2026, 5:29:15 PM and 2/27/2026, 6:55:53 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This component for adding carting entries underwent significant evolution, primarily replacing simple text inputs with advanced `AutocompleteSearch` and `SelectBox` components.
        *   **Initial form setup** (5:29:15 PM) included fields like shipping bill details, dates, customer, cargo type (radio group), vessel/voyage, POL, POD, FPD, routing, packages, gross weight, and volume. `AutocompleteSearch` was initially implemented for "Vessel/Voyage" (autofilling POL/POD) and "Customer".
        *   **Shipper and Consignee Autocomplete:** The form was updated to use `AutocompleteSearch` for "Shipper" (6:05:21 PM) and "Consignee" (6:09:54 PM), enabling dynamic search and selection of these entities, and storing their respective `serial_id`s (`shipper_id`, `consignee_id`).
        *   **Routing Autocomplete:** The "Routing" input was converted to an `AutocompleteSearch` using a "port" endpoint (6:35:28 PM), also capturing a `routing_code`.
        *   **Package Type Select:** A predefined list of `packageTypeOptions` (e.g., FEET, METER, CBM, KGS) was introduced, and the "Package Type" input was replaced with a `SelectBox` (6:51:56 PM). A minor formatting fix to the options array followed (6:52:06 PM).
        *   **FPD Autocomplete:** The "FPD" (Final Place of Discharge) input was also converted to an `AutocompleteSearch` using the "port" endpoint (6:55:53 PM), similar to "Routing", and captures an `fpd_code`.
    *   **Content Patterns:** The form consistently uses `formik` for state management, converts empty date fields to `null` before submission, and provides user feedback via `react-hot-toast`. The transition from basic inputs to autocompletes indicates a move towards richer, more validated data entry.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\frontend\envosys-frontend\src\optionService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Rapid changes occurred between 2/27/2026, 5:36:25 PM and 2/27/2026, 5:42:24 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This service is crucial for transforming raw API data into a standardized `{ value, label, serial_id, raw }` format for UI components.
        *   **Initial Setup** (5:36:25 PM) established `staticOptions` and an extensive `normalizeOption` function with specific logic for various `endpointKey`s, including `vessel-voyage`, `port-data`, sales/CS roles, and `customer-master`. It also introduced `fetchOptions` to retrieve and normalize data, with special handling for "accounts backend" keys.
        *   **Customer Master Normalization Adjustments:** The `customer-master` normalization logic within `normalizeOption` saw several quick modifications in close succession (5:37:49 PM, 5:38:26 PM, 5:38:32 PM, 5:38:57 PM). These were iterative attempts to correctly extract the `value` and `label` from incoming `item` objects, reflecting backend data structure nuances.
        *   **Robust Customer Master Normalization:** The final update (5:42:24 PM) refined the `customer-master` normalization to prioritize `item.label` and `item.value` but included fallbacks to `item.name` for both `label` and `value`, making the parsing more resilient to varied backend responses.
    *   **Content Patterns:** The `normalizeOption` function is a central dispatcher with `else if` blocks for different endpoint keys, demonstrating a modular approach to data transformation. Frequent `console.log` statements indicate active debugging.

### Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Shift to Dynamic Inputs:** There's a clear and consistent pattern of replacing static input fields with dynamic, autocomplete-enabled search boxes (`AutocompleteSearch`) for entities like Customer, Shipper, Consignee, Vessel/Voyage, Routing, and FPD. This improves data quality and user experience by leveraging searchable lists from the backend.
*   **Centralized Option Handling:** The `optionService.ts` acts as a crucial layer for normalizing diverse data structures from various API endpoints into a consistent format expected by frontend components. This abstraction allows frontend components to interact with options uniformly.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid sequence of commits, particularly for the `AddCartingForm.tsx` and `optionService.ts`, suggests an active and iterative development or debugging process, with immediate adjustments based on testing or evolving requirements.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The presence of `console.log` statements throughout the `optionService.ts` code indicates ongoing debugging and verification of data flow and transformation.
*   **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Both the logout hook and the carting form directly interact with backend APIs, indicating a full-stack development effort. Specific attention is given to data format consistency (e.g., date to null conversion) and authentication headers.

## 2:55:06 PM
The code changes log reveals an active development environment with significant focus on database migration to Prisma, environment variable management, and server startup robustness.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\server.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 1:31 PM - 1:58 PM**: Initial setup of an Express server with JSON/URL-encoded body parsers, detailed CORS configuration, `morgan` logging, and various public routes (login, logout, reset password, ports, party, migration). It includes a dynamic file download endpoint using `process.env` for directory paths and establishes a PostgreSQL connection using `pool.connect()`.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:01 PM - 2:11 PM**: The `config/config` import was moved to the very top, marked as "MUST BE FIRST" to ensure environment variables are loaded early. The server startup logic was refactored into an `async startServer` function. The database connection check was updated to use an `await testConnection()` function (imported from `database.ts`). File download directories were updated to use `CONFIG` variables. Console logs were added for debugging the module load order and `startServer` call.
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:04 PM - 3:39 PM**: This file underwent multiple cycles of drastic simplification (removing most middleware, routes, and file download logic) followed by full restoration. This indicates iterative development, testing, and debugging. The database connection check mechanism also fluctuated between `pool.connect().then().catch()` and `await pool.query("SELECT 1")` within a `try/catch` block, often with `process.exit(1)` on connection failure, demonstrating an emphasis on server startup reliability. Console logs were frequently added or modified for debugging various parts of the server's initialization and imports.
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:41 PM - 3:53 PM**: The server code was restored to a comprehensive state, including all middleware, public/protected routes, file download functionality, and the `pool.connect().then().catch()` database connection check with exit on failure.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\database.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 1:32 PM**: Initializes a PostgreSQL `Pool` using `process.env` variables and provides helper functions (`query`, `insertQuery`, `updateQuery`, `insertMany`) for database interaction.
    *   **2/27/2026, 1:56 PM**: `dotenv` was temporarily introduced and configured locally to load the development `.env` file, indicating an initial attempt at environment management.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:03 PM**: Switched to using `CONFIG` object variables (e.g., `CONFIG.DB_HOST`) for `Pool` configuration and SQL query schema, reflecting a more centralized environment setup. `dotenv` imports were removed.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:07 PM**: A `testConnection` function was added to perform a `SELECT 1` query, enabling a health check for the database connection.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:49 PM - 3:04 PM**: Reverted the `Pool` configuration back to directly using `process.env` variables, and commented out some internal connection logging.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\routes\index.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 1:32 PM**: Added `UserRoutes` and `MenuPermissionRoutes` to the API router. Included debugging `console.log` statements and `process.on` listeners for global error handling.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:32 PM**: Removed the debugging `console.log` statements and global error handlers.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:34 PM**: Temporarily added `pool` and `logger` imports and a `pool.connect().then().catch()` block for database connection logging, which was subsequently removed.
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:40 PM - 5:01 PM**: Showed frequent commenting and uncommenting of various route registrations (`/api/ports`, `Paths.HBL.Base`, `/carting`, `/stuffing`), suggesting modular development or feature-specific testing.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\config\config.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 1:58 PM**: Initial definition of the `CONFIG` object, loading environment variables from a hardcoded `.env.development` path.
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:04 PM**: Significantly improved environment loading by making the `dotenv.config` path dynamic based on `NODE_ENV`. Added default values for `DB_PORT` and `DB_SCHEMA`, and included document path variables (`UPLOAD_DOC_PATH`, `DOWNLOAD_PDF_DOC_PATH`, `DOWNLOAD_JSON_DOC_PATH`). Corrected `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` source.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\common\util\prisma.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 2:01 PM - 3:32 PM**: Consistently set up Prisma Client using `@prisma/adapter-pg` and `CONFIG.DATABASE_URL`, with minor refactoring in how the `connectionString` is passed to the adapter.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\customer.prisma`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:35 PM**: Defined the `customer` Prisma model with fields for multi-tenancy (`tenant_id`, `loc_code`) and audit.
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:22 PM**: Added `@@index` for `tenant_id` and `loc_code` and `@@map("customer_master")` for explicit table mapping.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\tanent.prisma`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:36 PM**: Defined the central `tenants` Prisma model, acting as a core for multi-tenancy with numerous reverse relations to other application entities (users, roles, companies, operational masters like jobs, vessels, parties, carting, customer).

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\core.prisma`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:36 PM**: Defined a suite of core Prisma models including `users`, `roles`, `companies`, `company_locations`, and various `_audit` tables, along with RBAC-related models (`menu_master`, `permissions`, `menu_permissions`). All models incorporate `tenant_id` for multi-tenancy and audit fields.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\models\operations.prisma`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:57 PM**: Introduced Prisma models for operational data: `JobMaster`, `VesselMaster`, `VesselVoyageMaster`, `VesselRouting`, `partyMaster`, and `partyType`. These models extensively use `BigInt` for IDs, `tenant_id` for multi-tenancy, `loc_code` for location filtering, enums for status/types, and comprehensive audit fields.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\prisma\schema.prisma`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:20 PM**: Configured Prisma Client and `postgresql` datasource. Defined active models for `notes`, `Sequence`, and `port_master`. A large section of commented-out models (e.g., `carting`, `customer`, various booking/audit tables) indicates an ongoing, substantial database migration or refactoring effort, with specific notes about `carting` lacking a unique identifier for Prisma Client.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\UserService.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:54 PM**: Made a significant shift towards using Prisma for user authentication and fetching detailed user information (`login`). Functions like `fetchUserWithDetails`, `validateUserPassword`, `updateUserLoginStatus`, `fetchUserMenus` now use Prisma. However, `saveNewUser`, `resetPassword`, and `setNewPassword` still rely on raw `pg.Pool` queries within transactions. This indicates a mixed database access strategy or an ongoing migration.
    *   **2/27/2026, 3:55 PM - 3:59 PM**: Added `console.log` statements for debugging the `login` flow.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\cartingService.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:02 PM**: Introduced as a new service, almost entirely implemented using Prisma for CRUD operations (`getAllCarting`, `getCartingByBillno`, `saveCarting`) and data aggregation (`getPODAnalytics`). It includes comprehensive filtering, pagination, and multi-tenancy logic. A helper `serializeCarting` is used to handle `BigInt` serialization.
    *   **2/27/2026, 6:44 PM**: Added `SaveCartingBody` interface for type safety and a `toBigInt` helper function for foreign key conversions.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\vesselAndVoyageService.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:11 PM**: Implemented `getAll` and `CreateVesselAndVoyage` functions. `getAll` uses Prisma for core data retrieval but falls back to raw `pool.query` for fetching related documents and notes. It features complex filtering and data transformation, including `stringifyBigInts` for serialization.
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:12 PM - 5:13 PM**: Added and refined validation for `vessel_id` during creation.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\Envosyes\envosys-backend\src\services\searchOptions.ts`**:
    *   **2/27/2026, 5:20 PM**: Provides a general autocomplete/search API (`getAll`) that dynamically constructs queries based on `endpointKey`. It exhibits a hybrid approach, using raw `pool.query` for many endpoints (e.g., customer, sales person, vendor, commodity) and Prisma (`findMany`) for others (e.g., ports, vessels, vessel-voyages, parties).
    *   **2/27/2026, 6:03 PM - 6:08 PM**: Migrated the "party prefixes" search from raw SQL to Prisma's `partyMaster.findMany`, enhancing multi-tenancy integration.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Database Migration (Prisma vs. Raw SQL)**: A prominent pattern is the ongoing migration from raw PostgreSQL `pg.Pool` queries to Prisma ORM. Some new services (like `cartingService`) are primarily Prisma-based, while others (`UserService`, `vesselAndVoyageService`, `searchOptions`) show a mixed approach, indicating a transitional phase or a strategic hybrid model.
2.  **Multi-Tenancy and Location Awareness**: The application consistently implements multi-tenancy using `tenant_id` and `loc_code` fields across almost all Prisma models and in query `where` clauses in services. This ensures data isolation and location-specific filtering.
3.  **Audit Logging**: Standard audit fields (`created_by`, `updated_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) are included in most Prisma models, providing an activity log for data changes.
4.  **BigInt Handling**: `BigInt` data types are widely used for IDs in Prisma models, necessitating explicit conversion to strings for JSON serialization in the service layer (e.g., `serializeCarting`, `stringifyBigInts`) to prevent serialization errors.
5.  **Environment Configuration**: The handling of environment variables evolved to a more robust, dynamic approach in `config.ts`, ensuring that correct environment files are loaded and configurations are strongly typed and provided via a `CONFIG` object.
6.  **Debugging Practices**: Frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements, and commenting/uncommenting of code blocks across various files, highlight an iterative development and debugging workflow.
7.  **Server Stability**: Repeated refactoring and explicit database connection checks (with `process.exit(1)` on failure) in `server.ts` demonstrate an emphasis on ensuring application stability and proper startup.
