# Activity Summary for 2/13/2026

## 2:18:12 PM
In the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\shipmentRoutes.ts`, updated on 2/13/2026, 12:12:31 PM, the `ShipmentRoutes` Express router is configured. This file centralizes the API endpoints for various shipment-related functionalities by importing services such as `getAll`, `getShipmentCards`, `getShipmentDetails`, `getAirShipmentDetails`, `getMilestone`, `getAirMilestone`, `sentMessage`, `getMessage`, `deleteDocument`, `fetchUploadedDoc`, and `toggleFlageForPriority` from `shipmentService`.

The file defines a comprehensive set of routes:
*   **GET routes** are used for fetching data related to shipments, including general shipment lists, card information, detailed shipment data (both regular and air shipments), milestones (regular and air), messages, and uploaded documents.
*   **POST routes** handle actions like sending messages and toggling a flag for shipment priority.
*   **DELETE routes** are provided for deleting documents.

A notable observation is that the `POST` route for uploading documents (`Paths.Shipment.uploadDoc`) is present but currently commented out, suggesting that this functionality might be temporarily disabled or under development. The overall pattern indicates a focus on comprehensive data retrieval, communication, and document management within the shipment domain.

In `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\shipmentRoutes.ts`, updated on 2/13/2026, 12:12:31 PM, the file defines a comprehensive set of API routes for managing shipments.

Key updates include:
*   **Extensive Shipment Management:** The file imports and utilizes numerous functions from `@src/services/shipmentService`, indicating a wide range of shipment-related operations such as fetching all shipments (`getAll`), shipment cards (`getShipmentCards`), detailed shipment information (`getShipmentDetails`, `getAirShipmentDetails`), milestones (`getMilestone`, `getAirMilestone`), messages (`getMessage`), document handling (`fetchUploadedDoc`, `deleteDocument`), and priority flagging (`toggleFlageForPriority`).
*   **Route Definitions:**
    *   Multiple `GET` routes are established for retrieving various types of shipment data, including general and air shipment details, milestones, messages, and uploaded documents.
    *   `POST` routes are defined for sending messages (`sentMessage`) and toggling a priority flag for shipments (`toggleFlageForPriority`).
    *   A `DELETE` route is present for deleting uploaded documents (`deleteDocument`).
*   **Document Upload Functionality (Commented Out):** A `POST` route for `uploadDocuments` utilizing `uploadMiddleware` is present but commented out, suggesting that document upload functionality might be under development or temporarily disabled.
*   **Dependency on Service Layer:** The pattern observed is a strong reliance on a dedicated `shipmentService` for all business logic, with `shipmentRoutes.ts` serving primarily as the routing layer, mapping specific paths to service functions.
*   **Structured Paths:** All route paths are imported from `@src/common/constants/Paths`, ensuring consistency and maintainability of API endpoints.
