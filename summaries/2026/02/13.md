# Activity Summary for 2/13/2026

## 2:18:12 PM
In the file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\shipmentRoutes.ts`, updated on 2/13/2026, 12:12:31 PM, the `ShipmentRoutes` Express router is configured. This file centralizes the API endpoints for various shipment-related functionalities by importing services such as `getAll`, `getShipmentCards`, `getShipmentDetails`, `getAirShipmentDetails`, `getMilestone`, `getAirMilestone`, `sentMessage`, `getMessage`, `deleteDocument`, `fetchUploadedDoc`, and `toggleFlageForPriority` from `shipmentService`.

The file defines a comprehensive set of routes:
*   **GET routes** are used for fetching data related to shipments, including general shipment lists, card information, detailed shipment data (both regular and air shipments), milestones (regular and air), messages, and uploaded documents.
*   **POST routes** handle actions like sending messages and toggling a flag for shipment priority.
*   **DELETE routes** are provided for deleting documents.

A notable observation is that the `POST` route for uploading documents (`Paths.Shipment.uploadDoc`) is present but currently commented out, suggesting that this functionality might be temporarily disabled or under development. The overall pattern indicates a focus on comprehensive data retrieval, communication, and document management within the shipment domain.
