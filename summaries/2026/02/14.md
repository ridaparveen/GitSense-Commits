# Activity Summary for 2/14/2026

## 10:10:53 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\routes\shipmentRoutes.ts` was updated on `2/13/2026, 12:12:31 PM`. This update primarily involves defining and structuring API routes related to shipment management within an Express.js application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`shipmentRoutes.ts`**: This file now centralizes numerous API endpoints for shipment-related operations.
    *   It imports a variety of services from `shipmentService`, indicating a rich set of backend functionalities for shipments. These services include fetching all shipments (`getAll`), specific shipment details (`getShipmentDetails`, `getAirShipmentDetails`), shipment cards (`getShipmentCards`), milestones (`getMilestone`, `getAirMilestone`), message handling (`getMessage`, `sentMessage`), document management (`fetchUploadedDoc`, `deleteDocument`, `uploadDocuments`), and a priority flag toggler (`toggleFlageForPriority`).
    *   The routes cover comprehensive CRUD-like operations (Create via `sendMessage`, Read via numerous `GET` routes, Update via `toggleFlageForPriority`, Delete via `deleteDocument`).
    *   Notable `GET` routes fetch general shipment information, detailed views, "air shipment" specific details and milestones, shipment cards, messages, and uploaded documents.
    *   `POST` routes are defined for sending messages and toggling a priority flag for shipments.
    *   A `DELETE` route is implemented for removing documents.
    *   A `POST` route for `uploadDocuments` is present but commented out, suggesting it might be under development, temporarily disabled, or handled differently, despite `uploadMiddleware` being imported.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The consistent use of `Paths.Shipment.<Action>` (e.g., `Paths.Shipment.Get`, `Paths.Shipment.SendMessage`) for defining route paths indicates a structured and organized approach to API endpoint management, likely using a central constants file for path definitions.
*   There's a clear distinction between general shipment data and "air shipment" specific data, with separate routes and services for `getAirShipmentDetails` and `getAirMilestone`.
*   Most routes directly map to a corresponding service function from `shipmentService`, highlighting a well-defined separation of concerns between routing and business logic.
*   Document management features (upload, delete, fetch) are integrated into the shipment routes, suggesting that document handling is a key part of the shipment workflow.
