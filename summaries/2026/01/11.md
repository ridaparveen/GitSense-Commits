# Activity Summary for 1/11/2026

## 4:34:46 PM
The provided log details changes exclusively within the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\modules\JwtToken.ts` file, which is responsible for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

**File-Specific Updates (`JwtToken.ts`):**
The core functionality of this file, including the import of `jsonwebtoken` and `TokenPayload` type, the retrieval of `JWT_SECRET` from environment variables, and the structure of `createToken` and `VerifyToken` functions, remained consistent throughout the logs. Both functions include a critical check to ensure `JWT_SECRET` is defined before proceeding. The `VerifyToken` function, in particular, shows no changes across any of the entries.

The sole area of modification was the `expiresIn` option within the `jwt.sign` method used by the `createToken` function.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes and `expiresIn` Evolution:**

*   **1/9/2026, 12:52:28 PM**: Initial state recorded with `expiresIn: '20s'`.
*   **1/9/2026, 12:56:06 PM**: Changed `expiresIn` to `20` (numeric value).
*   **1/9/2026, 12:56:22 PM**: Further reduced `expiresIn` to `10` (numeric value).
*   **1/9/2026, 1:03:55 PM**: Reverted `expiresIn` back to `'20s'` (string value).
*   **1/9/2026, 1:40:27 PM**: Significantly increased `expiresIn` to `'7d'` (7 days).
*   **1/9/2026, 3:36:25 PM**: Changed `expiresIn` back to `'20s'`.
*   **1/9/2026, 3:40:25 PM**: Changed `expiresIn` back to `'7d'`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent JWT Module Structure**: The fundamental design of `JwtToken.ts` for handling token creation and verification, including error handling for an undefined `JWT_SECRET`, remained constant.
*   **`expiresIn` Fluctuation**: There's a clear pattern of frequently adjusting the token expiration time. This repeatedly oscillated between very short durations (e.g., `'20s'`, `20`, `10`) suitable for rapid testing or very short-lived tokens, and a much longer duration (`'7d'`) typically used for session tokens. This suggests active experimentation or refinement of token lifespan settings.
*   **No other functional changes**: Apart from the `expiresIn` parameter, no other part of the `createToken` or `VerifyToken` functions, nor any other line of code in the file, was modified.
