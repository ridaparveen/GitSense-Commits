# Activity Summary for 1/17/2026

## 2:28:46 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\transit.controller.ts` underwent a minor modification between 1/15/2026, 10:56:41 AM and 1/15/2026, 10:57:03 AM.

The change specifically involves an update to a `console.log` statement within the `getTransitReports` asynchronous function.
*   At 10:56:41 AM, the log message was: `console.log("mainQuery--",mainQuery);`
*   At 10:57:03 AM, it was updated to: `console.log("mainQuery--@@@@@@",mainQuery);`

This change appears to be a quick, minor adjustment, likely for debugging or identifying specific log outputs, given the very short time interval between the two timestamps and the nature of the modification. The core logic of the `getTransitReports` function, which handles fetching and processing transit analytics reports, remains unchanged across these two entries.
