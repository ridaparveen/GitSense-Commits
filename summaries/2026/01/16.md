# Activity Summary for 1/16/2026

## 2:21:54 PM
The file `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\transit.controller.ts` underwent a minor change within a short span on January 15, 2026.

**File-Specific Update:**
The primary change in `transit.controller.ts` is an alteration to a `console.log` statement within the `getTransitReports` asynchronous function.

*   At **1/15/2026, 10:56:41 AM**, the code included `console.log("mainQuery--",mainQuery);`.
*   By **1/15/2026, 10:57:03 AM**, this line was modified to `console.log("mainQuery--@@@@@@",mainQuery);`.

The change solely involves adding "@@@@@@" to the string literal used for logging the `mainQuery` variable, likely for debugging purposes to distinguish different log outputs. No functional logic of the `getTransitReports` controller was altered.
