# Activity Summary for 1/1/2026

## 9:01:41 AM
The provided log details changes across two main files: `src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx` and `src\pages\shipment\shipment-details-page.tsx`, along with a single snapshot of `src\index.css`. The updates primarily focus on enhancing the shipment tracking user interface and logic within a React frontend application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\tracking-stepper.tsx`**: This file, responsible for rendering a visual tracking stepper for shipments, underwent numerous iterations throughout the day, spanning from 10:37 AM to 3:25 PM.
    *   **Subtitle Formatting Enhancement:** A consistent pattern of changes involved refactoring the display of date information (ETD, ATD, ETA, ATA) within the timeline steps. Initially, these were simple template strings. Over several commits (e.g., 12/31/2025, 10:37:33 AM, 10:43:44 AM, 10:44:45 AM, 10:52:27 AM), the subtitles were converted to more structured `<span>` elements with specific Tailwind CSS classes. This aimed for a more uniform and visually distinct presentation, including making certain date values bold.
    *   **Icon Logic Complexity:** The logic for displaying icons (Ship, Railway, Truck) and their corresponding colors within the tracking steps saw significant, often iterative, adjustments. This included modifying conditions for when icons should appear based on shipment completion status (`completed`), the type of `shipmentProgress.scope` (e.g., "Port-Rail-Door" vs. "Port-Port"), and the presence of various date fields (`atd`, `etd`, `eta`, `ata`, `isRailVerified`). A new `data` variable was introduced (12/31/2025, 3:10:08 PM) to encapsulate a complex conditional logic for icon visibility, tailoring it to different shipment scopes (e.g., showing the ship icon if departed for "Port-Port" but if not departed for other scopes).
    *   **Visual Refinements:** The `LocationPinIcon` SVG definition was substantially redesigned (12/31/2025, 2:29:37 PM) from an outlined icon to a solid, filled pin with a white inner circle. Additionally, the color for "completed" states of icons (`#2E7D32`) was updated to a darker green shade (`#4D7C0F`) across various parts of the component (12/31/2025, 3:25:10 PM). The `notCompletedLabelColor` was also changed from orange (`#EF6C00`) to a dark gray (`#09090B`) (12/31/2025, 11:07:51 AM).
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\index.css`**: This file contains global styling definitions for the application. A single entry (12/31/2025, 10:42:14 AM) shows its state, which includes custom font families (InterVariable), a comprehensive color palette with new and old color variable definitions, spacing scales, breakpoints, typography utilities, and custom scrollbar styling, along with specific overrides for MUI DataGrid components. No changes were observed in this file within the provided log entries.
*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\pages\shipment\shipment-details-page.tsx`**: This component serves as the main page for displaying shipment details and integrates the `TrackingStepper` component. It remained largely stable, with the two log entries (12/31/2025, 11:10:14 AM and 11:13:18 AM) showing identical code. It handles fetching shipment data for both ocean and air modes and dynamically renders relevant sub-components like `MapContainer`, `ShipmentProgress`, `MilestoneAirContainer`, or `MilestoneContainerV2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on UI/UX Refinement:** The most dominant pattern is the continuous refinement of the user interface, especially for the `TrackingStepper` component. This involves improving the visual clarity of date information and meticulously adjusting icon display logic to accurately reflect various tracking states.
*   **Iterative Development:** The high frequency of minor changes and identical entries for `tracking-stepper.tsx` suggests an iterative development process, possibly involving frequent saves, minor adjustments, and debugging to achieve the desired visual and logical behavior of the tracking timeline.
*   **Styling Consistency through Theming:** Updates to color constants and SVG definitions indicate an ongoing effort to maintain a consistent visual style across the application.
*   **Conditional Rendering Logic:** There is a recurring theme of increasingly complex conditional rendering logic for icons based on multiple data points (`atd`, `etd`, `isRailVerified`, `scope`, `podCompleted`), highlighting an attempt to provide precise visual cues for diverse shipment scenarios.
