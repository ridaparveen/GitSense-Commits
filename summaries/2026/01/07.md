# Activity Summary for 1/7/2026

## 8:30:11 AM
The log details development activities within a `javascript-learning` directory, all occurring on January 4, 2026.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\javascript-learning\index.html`**:
    *   Initial creation (1/4/2026, 3:18:32 PM) included a basic HTML structure with a `<h1>Hello world!</h1>` heading and an empty `<button>` element configured with an `onclick` JavaScript alert.
    *   Within nine seconds (1/4/2026, 3:18:41 PM), the button was updated to display the text "Click me".

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\javascript-learning\0_variables.js`**:
    *   This file began with a `console.log` statement (1/4/2026, 3:36:06 PM) that contained a syntax error (an extra semicolon inside the string).
    *   The syntax error was quickly corrected (1/4/2026, 3:36:47 PM).
    *   Subsequent updates (1/4/2026, 3:38:49 PM and 3:38:57 PM) introduced the declaration of a variable `myAge` using `var`, demonstrating `camel case` notation.
    *   A significant expansion of content occurred around 3:45:07 PM, where several more `var` declarations (`my_firtsName`, `_lastName`, `$myAge`) were added to further illustrate variable naming conventions. This update also temporarily included examples of *invalid* variable names (`123data`, `my@email`) which were logged.
    *   Shortly after (1/4/2026, 3:45:32 PM), the lines declaring and logging the invalid variable names were commented out, indicating a refinement or correction based on JavaScript's naming rules. The final entry for this file (1/4/2026, 3:45:41 PM) showed no functional change from the previous state.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/4/2026, 3:18:41 PM**: HTML button text added.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:36:47 PM**: Initial JavaScript syntax error fixed.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:38:49 PM**: First variable declaration introduced in JavaScript.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:45:07 PM**: Major expansion of variable examples, including invalid ones.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:45:32 PM**: Correction/commenting out of invalid variable examples.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Learning Progression**: The changes clearly indicate a learning process, moving from basic HTML structure and initial JavaScript output to exploring fundamental JavaScript concepts like variable declaration and naming rules.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: There's a pattern of quick iterations, where initial code (e.g., empty button, syntax error, invalid variable names) is immediately followed by corrections, additions, or commenting out of problematic parts.
*   **Focus on Fundamentals**: The JavaScript file specifically demonstrates attempts to understand and apply variable declaration rules, including different valid naming conventions (e.g., `camel case`, use of underscores and dollar signs) and identifying invalid ones.
*   **Single Session**: All changes occurred within a relatively short period on a single day, suggesting active engagement in a learning session.

## 1:57:42 PM
**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\javascript-learning\index.html`**
This file, likely a main entry point for a web application, saw initial development and a quick refinement.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:18:32 PM:** An HTML boilerplate was established, containing a `<h1>Hello world!</h1>` and an empty `<button>` element with an `onclick` event to display "welcome to my js tutorials".
*   **1/4/2026, 3:18:41 PM:** The immediate update added the text "Click me" inside the button, making it visible and descriptive to the user.

**`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\javascript-learning\0_variables.js`**
This JavaScript file demonstrates fundamental concepts of console logging and variable declaration.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:36:06 PM:** The file began with a `console.log` statement, which initially had a syntax error (semicolon inside the string literal).
*   **1/4/2026, 3:36:47 PM:** The syntax error in `console.log("Hello my first js code!";)` was corrected to `console.log("Hello my first js code!");`.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:38:49 PM:** A variable `myAge` was declared using `var` and assigned a value of 25, then logged to the console. A comment `// camel` was added.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:38:57 PM:** The comment was refined to `// camel case`.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:45:07 PM:** Further variable declarations were added, showcasing different valid naming conventions (e.g., `my_firtsName`, `_lastName`, `$myAge`). This update also included examples of *invalid* variable names (`123data`, `my@email`), which were logged directly.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:45:32 PM:** The lines demonstrating and logging the invalid variable names (`123data` and `my@email`) were commented out, indicating a step in understanding and isolating valid code.
*   **1/4/2026, 3:45:41 PM:** No functional changes were introduced in this last entry, it remained identical to the previous version.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
All changes occurred on **1/4/2026**, suggesting a continuous learning or development session. The file paths indicate a project focused on "javascript-learning". The changes are incremental, starting with basic functionality or syntax, then adding more details, correcting errors, and exploring more advanced concepts (like variable naming rules) within each file. The `.js` file specifically shows a progression from basic `console.log` to understanding variable declaration and naming conventions.

## 1:57:45 PM
`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\analytics\query\booking.query.ts`
- **Timestamp**: 1/2/2026, 2:35:49 PM
- **Key Changes**:
    - Introduced `QueryBuilderI` interface to define parameters for booking queries.
    - Added `bookingQueryBuilder` function to construct SQL queries for analytics reports based on different `type` parameters.
    - Updated `customizer.selectedColumns` to ignore new columns (`country_name`, `networkdays`, `bl_release_date`, `booking_status_action_date`, `est_cargo_ready_date`) and explicitly include others (`bookingdate`, `booking_status_action_date`, `est_cargo_ready_date`, `departure_date`).
    - Implemented several query types:
        - `BookingDatetoActualDeparture`: Calculates average day difference between booking date and actual departure for each `fileno` and `contno`, returning value and percentage against the max value.
        - `BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWise`: Similar to the above, but aggregated MBL-wise (`fileno`, `mblno`).
        - `BookingDatetoActualDepartureStackedBar`: Configures a stacked bar chart view, categorizing day differences into 'Less than 1 week', '1 - 2 weeks', etc., and uses `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` for dynamic grouping and ordering.
        - `BookingDatetoActualDepartureMblWiseStackedBar`: Extends the stacked bar functionality for MBL-wise aggregation.
    - The SQL queries consistently filter by `CompanyName` and `departure_date` range and handle `NULL` or '0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC' date values.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\getCustomerOptions.ts`
- **Timestamps**: Multiple changes between 1/2/2026, 3:58:49 PM and 1/2/2026, 4:31:23 PM.
- **Key Changes**:
    - **Initial State (1/2/2026, 3:58:49 PM)**:
        - The `getAllCustomerOptions` function was refactored significantly. A large block of commented-out code for handling `AGENT` and `CUSTOMER` roles, including pagination logic, was removed.
        - The active `getAllCustomerOptions` now retrieves distinct `account_name` from `mtr_tracking_data`, filters by an optional `search` query parameter using `ILIKE`, and limits results to 10.
        - Introduced `deleteCustomerOption` function, which initially expected `account_name` from `req.body` to delete records from `mtr_tracking_data`.
    - **Subsequent Updates (1/2/2026, 4:17:54 PM to 1/2/2026, 4:31:23 PM)**:
        - The `deleteCustomerOption` function was modified to use `customer_id` from `req.params` instead of `account_name` from `req.body` for deletion.
        - The database table targeted for deletion also changed from `mtr_tracking_data` to `Account_Master_Customer_MAP` by the final timestamp (1/2/2026, 4:31:23 PM).
        - Console logs for `customer_id` and `req.params` were added for debugging purposes in the `deleteCustomerOption` function.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\routes\getCustomerOptionsRoute.ts`
- **Timestamps**: Multiple changes between 1/2/2026, 3:59:33 PM and 1/2/2026, 4:28:07 PM.
- **Key Changes**:
    - **Initial State (1/2/2026, 3:59:33 PM)**:
        - Defined routes: `router.get("/", getAllCustomerOptions)` and `router.delete("/", deleteCustomerOption)`.
    - **Subsequent Updates (1/2/2026, 3:59:43 PM to 1/2/2026, 4:28:07 PM)**:
        - The `delete` route path was updated from `/` to `/delete` (1/2/2026, 3:59:43 PM).
        - Later, it was further modified to include a dynamic `customer_id` parameter: `/delete/:customer_id` (1/2/2026, 4:18:20 PM), which remained consistent through the final change.

`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\controllers\code.controller.ts`
- **Timestamps**: Multiple changes between 1/2/2026, 4:12:38 PM and 1/5/2026, 5:40:32 PM.
- **Key Changes**:
    - **`getAllCustomer` Function**:
        - **Initial State (1/2/2026, 4:12:38 PM)**: Fetches customer data along with associated shipper mappings, documents, and customer mappings based on `acode`. The `customer_map` column was not explicitly selected in the main `dataQuery`.
        - **1/5/2026, 12:41:04 PM**: Modified the `dataQuery` to explicitly select the `customer_map` column from `PO_AccountMaster_Customer_Master`.
        - **1/5/2026, 4:47:49 PM**: Introduced a `normalizePgArray` helper function to properly parse PostgreSQL array strings (e.g., `{A,B,C}`) into JavaScript arrays. The `customer_map` field in the `customerData` object within `jsonArray` mapping was updated to use this `normalizePgArray` function.
        - **1/5/2026, 4:51:59 PM**: Reverted `normalizePgArray` for `customer_map` in the `customerData` object back to `chkStr(row.customer_map)` but explicitly set `customer_map` to `Array.isArray(row.customer_map) ? row.customer_map : []` in the final return object for `jsonArray`. This suggests a shift in how `customer_map` is expected from the database or handled for output.
        - **1/5/2026, 5:00:11 PM**: The `normalizePgArray` function was commented out, indicating it's no longer used for processing `customer_map` in `getAllCustomer`. The `customer_mapping` field in the returned object was explicitly set to an empty array if `row.customer_map` is not an array. The `customerQuery` and related `customerMapData` logic were commented out from `getAllCustomer` (1/5/2026, 5:40:32 PM).
        - **1/5/2026, 5:39:13 PM**: The `parseCustomerMapping` function (which was originally created for `createCustomer`) was moved to be a global/module-level helper function, placed *before* `getAllCustomer`. This indicates it might be intended for broader use or better organization.
    - **`createCustomer` Function**:
        - **Initial State (1/2/2026, 4:12:38 PM)**: Handles creation/modification of customer records, including associated types and shipper mappings. It sanitizes `cname`, checks for existing customers, and performs database operations within a transaction. The `customer_mapping` was passed directly as the 22nd value in `insertCustomerValues`.
        - **1/5/2026, 10:23:34 AM**: The `insertCustomerQuery` was updated to include `customer_map` as a column for insertion (`$23`), and the `insertCustomerValues` array was extended to include `customer_mapping` (which was a raw string at this point).
        - **1/5/2026, 11:15:27 AM**: `customer_mapping` from `req.body` was parsed using `JSON.parse` into `customerArray` before insertion. This suggests `customer_mapping` is expected as a JSON string representing an array.
        - **1/5/2026, 11:17:44 AM**: Introduced a new `parseCustomerMapping` helper function to robustly handle parsing `customer_mapping` from the request body, including cases where it might be an array (due to duplicate form fields) or a single string. It tries to parse JSON and ensures an array is returned. The `customerArray` now uses this helper.
        - **1/5/2026, 11:22:13 AM**: Corrected the call to `parseCustomerMapping` to use `req.body.customer_mapping` instead of just `customer_mapping` variable.
        - **1/5/2026, 5:39:13 PM**: The `parseCustomerMapping` function was moved to a higher scope, before `getAllCustomer`.
    - **General Patterns/Recurring Elements**:
        - Frequent use of `query` for database interactions (PostgreSQL).
        - Consistent logging (`logger.info`, `console.log`) for debugging request body, data, and SQL queries.
        - `chkStr` utility function is widely used to ensure string values, likely to prevent `null` or `undefined` from appearing in the output.
        - Error handling with `try...catch` blocks and returning 500 status for internal server errors.
        - Customer-related data management (fetching, creating, updating) across multiple tables (`PO_AccountMaster_Customer_Master`, `agent_po_account_master_type`, `Account_Master_Shipper_MAP`, `document_upload_details`, `Account_Master_Customer_MAP`).
        - Repeated handling of `acode` generation/retrieval and `cname` sanitization in the `createCustomer` function.

## 3:00:48 PM
The codebase includes two primary files related to analytics and data export, `export.query.ts` and `analyticsExportService.ts`, along with `cbmService.ts` for CBM-specific reports.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
*   **Key Updates (last recorded change 1/7/2026, 2:05:35 PM; no changes in subsequent entries up to 2:46:54 PM)**:
    *   This file provides utility functions for generating dynamic SQL queries based on report names and user-defined filters.
    *   It defines a `getMonthValue` helper to convert month strings (e.g., "Jan") or numbers to numeric month values.
    *   The main function, `bookingQuery`, constructs various PostgreSQL query fragments. These queries are stored in an object, indexed by report names such as "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to Estimated Departure", and "Booking Date to POD Arrival" (with "MBL Wise" and "Stacked Bar" variations).
    *   All generated SQL queries consistently join `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry` tables on `mblno`, filter by a list of `account_name` values (converted to lowercase), and include conditions to ensure date fields are not null or a placeholder '0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'.
    *   "Stacked Bar" queries incorporate conditional logic to filter by month, week, or quarter, and categorize day differences into week-based ranges (e.g., 'Less than 1 week', '1 - 2 weeks').
    *   A `console.log` statement assists in debugging the `CompanyName` parameter.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\analyticsExportService.ts`**
*   **Key Updates**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 2:15:08 PM**: Introduced the `getExportData` function, which serves as the primary endpoint for handling analytics export requests. It processes query parameters for date ranges, mbl-wise filtering, booking status, report name, stacked export, and columns. It implements default date range handling and retrieves user/company context.
        *   For booking-related reports, it dynamically builds a main SQL query using `bookingQuery` (from `export.query.ts`) and applies `DISTINCT ON` logic based on `mblwise` parameter (either `mblno` or a combination of `voyage`, `contno`, and container type).
        *   For non-booking reports, it uses `nonBookingQuery` (from `export.query.ts`).
        *   Includes a specific post-processing step for "TEU MBLwise" reports to deduplicate containers and mark subsequent occurrences with "teu: '-'".
        *   A `replaceColumnHandler` function is defined to standardize "LONG BEACH" port names to "LOS ANGELES" in the results.
    *   **1/7/2026, 2:23:04 PM**: Minor refactoring in the non-booking (`else`) block: variable `customQuery` declaration was adjusted, a trailing space removed from `mainQuery` template literal, and a minor stylistic change from ternary operator to logical OR for `contType` assignment inside the TEU filter.
    *   **1/7/2026, 2:37:55 PM**: Added a `console.log` statement for `mainQuery` within the non-booking report block for debugging purposes, mirroring existing debug logs in the booking report section.

**File: `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\cbmService.ts`**
*   **Key Updates (last recorded change 1/7/2026, 2:43:17 PM; no changes in subsequent entry up to 2:44:40 PM)**:
    *   This file introduces the `getCBMReports` function, designed to generate CBM (Cubic Meter) related analytics reports.
    *   It handles query parameters for `group_by_column`, date ranges, and `mblwise`. Similar to other services, it sets default date ranges and retrieves company information for filtering.
    *   It dynamically determines the `DISTINCT ON` clause for SQL queries based on `mblwise` (either `mblno` for MBL-wise reports or a composite key of `voyage`, `contno`, and `cont_type` otherwise).
    *   For specific `group_by_column` values ("country_of_origin" or "country_of_discharge"), it constructs a specialized query that joins with `portmaster` to aggregate CBM by country and calculate percentages.
    *   For other grouping columns, it generates a general CBM aggregation query, also calculating percentages relative to the maximum CBM. This general query utilizes `replaceValueInQuery` to standardize "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for the grouping entity.
    *   All CBM queries include filters for `account_name` and `departure_date` range, and ensure `cbm` values are valid.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Timestamp Stability**: Most timestamps for `export.query.ts` and `cbmService.ts` show identical content, implying stable code or non-substantive saves within the given log timeframe for those files. `analyticsExportService.ts` had minor, mostly debugging and stylistic, changes.
*   **Date Range Management**: Both `analyticsExportService.ts` and `cbmService.ts` use a `defaultDateRange` utility when `fromDate` or `toDate` are not provided in the request, ensuring consistent date filtering.
*   **Company-Specific Filtering**: A common pattern is extracting `CompanyName` from user objects and transforming it into a comma-separated, lowercased, and quoted string list (`companyList`) for use in SQL `IN` clauses to filter by `account_name`.
*   **Port Name Standardization**: Both `analyticsExportService.ts` and `cbmService.ts` explicitly remap "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for port-related fields (`pod`, `place_of_delivery`, or the grouping `entity`), indicating a system-wide data consistency rule.
*   **MBL-wise / Container Distinctness Logic**: A recurring conditional logic is present in both `analyticsExportService.ts` and `cbmService.ts` to apply `DISTINCT ON` clauses (either on `mblno` or on `voyage`, `contno`, and container type) based on whether an "MBLwise" report is requested, demonstrating a standardized approach to handling report granularity.
*   **SQL Query Structure**: Queries frequently involve `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry` tables, extensive date range filtering, and checks for non-null/non-default date values.
*   **Logging for Debugging**: Frequent use of `console.log` and `logger.info`/`logger.error` across all updated files for monitoring request parameters, generated queries, and potential issues.

## 4:00:44 PM
The provided log details changes across several files in the `t360-backend-v2` project, primarily focusing on analytics and report generation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/7/2026, 2:05:35 PM to 2:46:54 PM.
    *   **Updates:** Across all recorded timestamps for this file, the code content remains identical. This suggests no functional changes were made or that any brief modifications were immediately reverted. The file exports a `getMonthValue` helper function and a `bookingQuery` function that constructs complex SQL queries for various booking-related reports (e.g., "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to POD Arrival", including "Stacked Bar" and "MBL Wise" variations), incorporating dynamic date range filtering, company lists, and grouping logic based on `displayBy` and `stackedExport` parameters.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\analyticsExportService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/7/2026, 2:15:08 PM; 2:23:04 PM; 2:24:15 PM; 2:37:55 PM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   Between 2:15:08 PM and 2:23:04 PM: Minor refactoring occurred within the `else` block (for non-booking reports). This included changes in indentation, variable declarations (e.g., `let` instead of `const`), and a slight adjustment in how `contType` is derived (`item.t49_cont_type ? item.t49_cont_type : item.cont_type` vs. `item.t49_cont_type || item.cont_type`). Functionally, the logic for processing non-booking reports remained consistent.
        *   Between 2:23:04 PM and 2:24:15 PM: The non-booking report `else` block was mostly reverted to its earlier structure, undoing the minor refactoring.
        *   Between 2:24:15 PM and 2:37:55 PM: A `console.log("===mainQuery===>", mainQuery);` statement was added inside the `else` block for non-booking reports, enhancing debugging capabilities for these queries.
    *   **Overall Functionality:** This service provides the `getExportData` function, which handles generating export data for analytics reports. It distinguishes between booking and non-booking reports, applies default date ranges, retrieves user and company information, and uses helper functions (`columnsQuery`, `bookingQuery`, `nonBookingQuery`, `dateFilterOnExport`, `replaceColumnHandler`) to build and execute SQL queries, and post-process results. A specific filter for "MBLwise TEU" reports is included to handle duplicate container entries. The `replaceColumnHandler` consistently renames "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for `pod` and `place_of_delivery`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\cbmService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/7/2026, 2:43:17 PM; 2:44:40 PM.
    *   **Updates:** Both recorded entries show identical code. The file defines `getCBMReports`, which generates analytics for CBM (Cubic Meter) reports, grouping data by specified columns (e.g., `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`). It dynamically builds SQL queries, handles date ranges, company filtering, and calculates values and percentages based on CBM data. It also includes logic for MBL-wise distinctness.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/7/2026, 3:01:07 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This file introduces the `bookingQueryBuilder` function, which is responsible for constructing specialized SQL queries for various booking-related analytics. It defines different query structures for "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to Actual Departure MblWise", and their "Stacked Bar" counterparts. These queries calculate day differences, average values, and percentages, incorporating date truncation for stacked bar charts and specific `DISTINCT ON` clauses for MBL-wise reporting. It dynamically configures columns and chart types based on the report requested.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\container.query.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/7/2026, 3:21:44 PM to 3:38:48 PM.
    *   **Updates:** All recorded entries for this file present identical code. The file exports `containerQueryBuilder`, a function that generates SQL queries for container-related reports. These reports include "Container Discharge vs Container Available", "Container Discharge Vs Final Delivery Date", "Container GateOut Vs GateIn", and "Container Or Vessel Discharge Vs GateOut". The queries calculate day differences, handle null/default date values (`0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC`), apply company filtering, and ensure distinctness based on container or voyage details. It also includes logic to handle potential division by zero and negative day differences when calculating percentages.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dynamic SQL Query Generation:** A prominent pattern across `export.query.ts`, `booking.query.ts`, and `container.query.ts` is the dynamic construction of SQL queries using template literals, adapting to various report types, date filters, and grouping criteria.
*   **Company-Specific Data Filtering:** All major query functions consistently process `CompanyName` (a string of company names separated by "||") into a `companyList` for use in SQL `IN` clauses, ensuring data is filtered by authorized companies.
*   **Date and Time Handling:** SQL queries frequently use `::timestamp` for type casting and `INTERVAL '1 day'` for date range adjustments. There's a recurring pattern of checking for `IS NOT NULL` and `!= '0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC'` to validate date fields, indicating a common data quality issue or default value handling.
*   **Distinct Row Selection:** For "MBL Wise" or container-level reports, `DISTINCT ON` clauses are heavily utilized, often based on `mblno` or a combination of `voyage`, `contno`, and `t49_cont_type`/`cont_type` to prevent duplicate entries for calculations.
*   **Date Difference Calculations:** `EXTRACT(DAY FROM date1 - date2)` is a common idiom for calculating the time duration between two dates in days for various reports.
*   **Stacked Bar Chart Logic:** `booking.query.ts` demonstrates specific logic for generating stacked bar chart data, categorizing day differences into predefined week-based ranges ("Less than 1 week", "1 - 2 weeks", etc.).
*   **Column Customization:** Functions like `getColumnsByCategory` are used to dynamically select relevant columns for reports, allowing for flexible report configurations and ignoring certain columns based on context.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent use of `console.log` and `logger.info` statements throughout the services indicates active development and a focus on observability for troubleshooting.
*   **Consistent Data Transformation:** The `replaceColumnHandler` in `analyticsExportService.ts` exemplifies a consistent data transformation rule, standardizing "LONG BEACH" to "LOS ANGELES" for certain port fields.
*   **Frequent Saves/Identical Content:** Several files (`export.query.ts`, `cbmService.ts`, `container.query.ts`) show multiple timestamps with identical code, suggesting frequent saving during development or potentially an automated version control interaction without substantive code changes between saves.
