# Activity Summary for 1/12/2026

## 2:09:48 PM
The changes log details modifications solely within the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\modules\JwtToken.ts` file.

**File-Specific Updates (`JwtToken.ts`):**
This file is responsible for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It uses `jsonwebtoken` and retrieves the `JWT_SECRET` from environment variables, throwing an error if it's undefined. The `VerifyToken` function remained consistent across all logged changes. The significant updates were exclusively to the `createToken` function, specifically altering the `expiresIn` option for the generated JWTs.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
All modifications occurred on **1/9/2026**, with a final state recorded on **1/12/2026**.
*   **1/9/2026, 12:52:28 PM:** Initial state with `expiresIn: '20s'`.
*   **1/9/2026, 12:56:06 PM - 1:03:55 PM:** A period of rapid adjustments where `expiresIn` was changed from `'20s'` to `20` (a number), then to `10` seconds, and finally reverted back to `'20s'`.
*   **1/9/2026, 1:40:27 PM:** The `expiresIn` value was significantly increased to `'7d'` (7 days).
*   **1/9/2026, 3:36:25 PM - 3:40:25 PM:** A brief revert to `'20s'` was made, quickly followed by another change back to `'7d'`.
*   **1/12/2026, 9:50:20 AM:** The file's state remained stable, retaining `expiresIn: '7d'`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the repeated modification and subsequent reversion of the `expiresIn` parameter within the `createToken` function. This suggests an active period of experimentation or decision-making regarding the JWT's validity duration. The values fluctuated between very short durations (10-20 seconds) and a much longer period of 7 days, indicating testing or a debate over appropriate token lifespan. The consistent elements across all changes were the imports, the method of retrieving the `JWT_SECRET`, and the error handling for an undefined secret. The `VerifyToken` function's implementation also remained constant.

The provided log details a series of code changes focusing primarily on the frontend of a T360 application, specifically around analytics, global search, and common UI components.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`src\components\common\popover-pannel.tsx`**: This component saw several rapid iterations (1/9/2026, 3:19 PM and 5:02 PM, then 1/12/2026, 1:02 PM).
    *   Initially, basic styling like `padding: "10px"` was adjusted.
    *   A significant refactor moved the `styles` object inside the component function and changed `top` positioning to `"calc(100% + 4px)"`, set `zIndex` to `1000`, and added `minWidth`.
    *   Later, it was re-architected to use `createPortal` (1/12/2026, 1:02 PM), requiring an `anchorRef` prop for dynamic positioning relative to its trigger, and setting a higher `zIndex` of `1300` for better overlay management.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\DateRange.tsx`**: This file underwent frequent modifications (1/9/2026, 3:23 PM - 3:37 PM).
    *   Updates included adding specific `Moment` type declarations to MUI `DatePicker` components.
    *   Styling adjustments were made to the `DatePicker` components, such as setting `borderRadius: "10px"` for input fields and explicitly coloring the `openPickerButton` icon to black (`#000`).
    *   A critical improvement involved implementing "SAFE parsing" for `fromDate` and `toDate` using `moment(..., true).isValid()` to prevent UI error states from invalid dates (1/9/2026, 3:32:00 PM), and explicitly setting `error: false` on the `textField` slot.
    *   Imports of `Moment` were toggled between standard and `type` imports.
*   **`src\components\core\layout.tsx`**: Changes (1/9/2026, 3:38 PM - 3:42 PM) primarily focused on token expiration logic.
    *   An auto-logout mechanism was introduced, calculating `remainingTime` by subtracting the current time from the token's expiration timestamp (`exp - now`).
    *   Debug `console.log` statements were added to trace token expiration.
    *   Commented-out utility functions for token expiration (`getTokenExp`, `isTokenExpired`) were removed, indicating their relocation to `utils/utils.ts`.
*   **`src\App.tsx` and `src\main.tsx`**: These files show no functional changes in the provided logs, suggesting minor reformatting or whitespace changes at timestamps 1/9/2026, 3:42:02 PM and 1/9/2026, 3:42:13 PM respectively.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**: This toolbar for analytics dashboards saw changes (1/9/2026, 3:43 PM and 1/12/2026, 1:06 PM - 1:14 PM).
    *   It manages global date filters, including toggling a custom date range picker.
    *   The state variable `showCustomDateRange` was initially used, then `showGlobalDateRange` was introduced, then removed, and then reintroduced along with `globalAnchorRef` for the global date filter's `PopoverPanel` positioning. This indicates a refinement in how popovers for global filters are managed.
    *   PDF export functionality for dashboards using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` is present, including dynamic logo integration.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\metricBox.tsx`**: This component for individual metric cards (1/9/2026, 3:44 PM) defines how various chart types (Bar, Pie, Line, StackedBar, Gauge) are rendered and integrates `MetricToolbar` and `MetricFooter`. No major functional changes observed in the log snippet for this file itself.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\BarChart.tsx`**: The `BarChart` component (1/9/2026, 3:44 PM) was introduced with ApexCharts, including logic to format data labels dynamically using `applyFormatting`.
*   **`src\utils\utils.ts`**: A `getTokenExp` utility function was added (1/9/2026, 3:45:52 PM) to safely extract the expiration timestamp from a JWT, used by the `Layout` component.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\MetricToolbar.tsx`**: This metric-specific toolbar component (1/9/2026, 5:01 PM - 5:12 PM and 1/12/2026, 1:03 PM) also received updates related to date filtering.
    *   It handles local `dateFilter`, `periodFilter`, and `viewByFilter` for individual metrics.
    *   The `zIndex` of the custom date range `Box` was adjusted multiple times.
    *   The layout/styling of the date range filter `Box` was significantly changed then reverted, indicating UI experimentation.
    *   Finally, an `anchorRef` was introduced for positioning its `PopoverPanel` using the portal pattern (1/12/2026, 1:03:24 PM).
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\Charts\GaugeChart.tsx`**: The `GaugeChart` component (1/9/2026, 5:35 PM - 5:36 PM) was introduced, using ApexCharts to display a radial bar chart with conditional coloring and custom formatter for "Days". The display of `item?.reportName` as the chart title was toggled.
*   **`src\pages\dashboard\dashboard-page.tsx`**: The dashboard page (1/9/2026, 6:20 PM and 1/12/2026, 12:43 PM) had minor changes related to `CompanyName` parameter in API calls (`useFetchShipmentDataQuery` and `useFetchCartDataQuery`), switching between `undefined` and `null`.
*   **`src\components\screen\misc\GlobalSearch.tsx`**: This component (1/9/2026, 6:25 PM - 6:30 PM and 1/12/2026, 12:42 PM - 12:47 PM) was frequently updated.
    *   It supports global search with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+K) and debounced input.
    *   A primary focus was on correctly passing the `CompanyName` parameter to the `ApiManager.getGlobalOptions` based on the user's role (`ADMIN_V2` vs. other roles) and the `selectedCustomer` state. This parameter underwent multiple revisions, leading to `localUser.role === "ADMIN_V2" ? {CompanyName: companyName} : {CompanyName: ""}` as the final logged state.
    *   Debugging `console.log` statements were added.
*   **`src\services\ApiManager.ts`**: The `getGlobalOptions` method (1/9/2026, 6:27 PM - 6:29 PM) was updated to align with parameter passing for `CompanyName` to `ApiMethods.get`. There were a few back-and-forth changes on whether `CompanyName` should be part of the URL query string or a `params` object in the API call.
*   **`src\services\Endpoints.ts`**: The `GET_GLOBAL_OPTIONS` endpoint definition (1/9/2026, 6:28 PM - 6:31 PM) was modified multiple times to accurately include the `CompanyName` in the URL query string, finally settling on `&CompanyName=${CompanyName.CompanyName}`.
*   **`src\services\ApiMethods.ts`**: This file (1/9/2026, 6:29 PM) defines the base URL (`import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`) and `getAppHeaders` (including Authorization from `localStorage`). It provides generic HTTP methods, but no direct keys are stored within the provided log content.
*   **`src\components\screen\analytics\analyticsContainer.tsx`**: The core analytics container (1/12/2026, 10:46 AM - 12:21 PM) manages the drag-and-drop and resizing of metrics.
    *   It uses `react-dnd` for grid item reordering (`moveItem`) and resizing (`saveSize`).
    *   Backend mutations (`useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation`) are used to persist layout changes.
    *   Error handling with `toast.success` and `toast.error` for saving operations was refined, with `try...catch` blocks being added and removed around the `saveMetricSize` mutation.
    *   `fetchSingleReport` fetches data for individual metric cards, including `selectedCustomer` and `user.role` in its query parameters.
*   **`src\components\common\chip-tabs-view.tsx`**: This component (1/12/2026, 12:00 PM - 12:52 PM) for displaying scrollable chip tabs underwent numerous styling adjustments.
    *   It includes navigation arrows for scrolling and an optional "New" button.
    *   The main `div` and inner scrollable container `div` saw many changes to their width constraints (`w-full`, `max-w-[1150px]`, `min-w-full`, `min-w-[Xpx]`) and `gap` between chips, indicating fine-tuning of responsive layout and spacing.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Analytics Feature Development**: A substantial portion of the changes revolves around enhancing and stabilizing the analytics dashboard, including date range filtering, chart rendering, and metric layout management.
*   **UI/UX Refinements**: Frequent adjustments to component styling (e.g., `borderRadius`, `zIndex`, `gap`, `width` properties) suggest an ongoing effort to perfect the visual appearance and user experience, especially for date pickers and tab views.
*   **State Management with Redux**: The consistent use of `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) across `Layout`, `AnalyticsToolbar`, `MetricToolbar`, `GlobalSearch`, and `AnalyticsContainer` indicates a robust Redux-based state management strategy for global and local application states.
*   **API Interaction and Error Handling**: Multiple components interact with API services, and there's a recurring pattern of using `useLazyFetchReportQuery`, `useSaveSequenceMutation`, `useSaveMetricSizeMutation` from Redux Toolkit Query, coupled with `toast` notifications for user feedback and `try...catch` blocks for error handling.
*   **Date and Time Handling**: `moment.js` is extensively used for date formatting, parsing, and calculations, especially in `DateRange.tsx` and `utils.ts`, demonstrating careful management of date logic.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The presence of numerous `console.log` statements throughout the code suggests an active development phase where debugging is a crucial part of the workflow.
*   **Component Architecture**: The application consistently uses a component-based architecture, breaking down complex features into smaller, reusable components like `PopoverPanel`, `DateRange`, `ChipsTabView`, `MetricToolbar`, etc.
*   **Dynamic Filtering/Parameters**: There's a recurring theme of passing dynamic parameters (like `selectedCustomer`, `user.role`, `dateFilter`) to backend API calls to ensure data is filtered appropriately based on user context and selections.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Many files exhibit multiple changes within a short time frame, especially for UI elements and API integration logic, indicating an agile development process with quick iterative improvements.
