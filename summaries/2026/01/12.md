# Activity Summary for 1/12/2026

## 2:09:48 PM
The changes log details modifications solely within the `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-backend\src\modules\JwtToken.ts` file.

**File-Specific Updates (`JwtToken.ts`):**
This file is responsible for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It uses `jsonwebtoken` and retrieves the `JWT_SECRET` from environment variables, throwing an error if it's undefined. The `VerifyToken` function remained consistent across all logged changes. The significant updates were exclusively to the `createToken` function, specifically altering the `expiresIn` option for the generated JWTs.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
All modifications occurred on **1/9/2026**, with a final state recorded on **1/12/2026**.
*   **1/9/2026, 12:52:28 PM:** Initial state with `expiresIn: '20s'`.
*   **1/9/2026, 12:56:06 PM - 1:03:55 PM:** A period of rapid adjustments where `expiresIn` was changed from `'20s'` to `20` (a number), then to `10` seconds, and finally reverted back to `'20s'`.
*   **1/9/2026, 1:40:27 PM:** The `expiresIn` value was significantly increased to `'7d'` (7 days).
*   **1/9/2026, 3:36:25 PM - 3:40:25 PM:** A brief revert to `'20s'` was made, quickly followed by another change back to `'7d'`.
*   **1/12/2026, 9:50:20 AM:** The file's state remained stable, retaining `expiresIn: '7d'`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the repeated modification and subsequent reversion of the `expiresIn` parameter within the `createToken` function. This suggests an active period of experimentation or decision-making regarding the JWT's validity duration. The values fluctuated between very short durations (10-20 seconds) and a much longer period of 7 days, indicating testing or a debate over appropriate token lifespan. The consistent elements across all changes were the imports, the method of retrieving the `JWT_SECRET`, and the error handling for an undefined secret. The `VerifyToken` function's implementation also remained constant.
