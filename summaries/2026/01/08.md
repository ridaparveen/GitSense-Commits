# Activity Summary for 1/8/2026

## 10:23:53 AM
The `c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360_Api\t360-frontend\src\App.js` file, last modified on 1/8/2026, 10:14:42 AM, defines the core routing and structure of a comprehensive React frontend application.

The file contains an extensive list of imports, indicating a wide range of features and modules. These imports can be broadly categorized into:
*   **Core UI and Theming**: `ThemeProvider`, `mainTheme` from `@mui/material`, `Toaster` for notifications.
*   **Routing and Authentication**: `react-router-dom` components (`Route`, `Routes`), `Layout`, `ProtectedRoute`, `AuthGuard`, `Auth0Login`, `Auth0LogoutHandler`, `HandleAuthCallback`, `RegistrationScreen`. This highlights a sophisticated authentication and authorization system.
*   **User Management**: `UserManagementScreen`, `UserFormScreen`, `NewRegisteredUserScreen`.
*   **Business Process Screens**: A multitude of screens covering various aspects like packing lists (`PackingListScreen`, `PLFormScreen`), service invoices (`ServiceInvoiceScreen`, `ServiceInvoiceFormScreen`), PO and DSO orders (`PoOrderScreen`, `PoOrderFormScreen`, `DsoOrderScreen`), OTM BOL (`OtmBolScreen`, `AddOtmBolScreen`, `EditOtmBolScreen`, `UploadOTMBOL`), commercial invoices (`CIScreen`, `CIFormScreen`), ALC (various `AlcScreen` variants), shipping orders, container reports, and SPR invoices.
*   **Master Data / Code Screens**: `ExpenseCodeScreen`, `DestinationScreen`, `VendorScreen`, `CustomerScreen`, `PartyScreen`, `AgentScreen`, `CityMaster`, `PortmasterScreen`.
*   **Booking and ISF Management**: A complex set of booking-related screens, including extended versions (`BookingDashbaordScreenExtend`, `AgentBookingFormScreenExtend`, `AgentPoFormExtend`), `ISFEntryFormScreen`, `HblEntryFormScreen`, `HblListDetails`, and `ISFDashboardScreen`.
*   **Tracking**: Dedicated screens for FCL, LCL, general shipment tracking, MTR, trucking details, rail, and air tracking.
*   **Dashboards, Analytics, and Reports**: `DashboardScreen`, `AnalyticsScreen`, `ReportSchedulerScreen`, `NewReportScreen`, `EditReportScreen`, `PdfParserScreen`, `Dashboard7501Screen`, `AlcExceptionDashboard`, `AlcDestinationCostRecord`.
*   **Planboards**: `BookingPlanBoardScreen`, `SPRPlanBoardScreen`.
*   **Detention Management**: `LineWiseScreen`, `LineWiseFormScreen`, `CustomerWiseScreen`.
*   **Admin and Settings**: `SettingsScreen`, `BackOfficeAdminTerminal`.

The `App` component organizes these screens using `react-router-dom`'s `Routes`. A key pattern is the extensive use of `ProtectedRoute` alongside `UserRoleEnum` (which includes roles like `ADMIN`, `CUSTOMER`, `AGENT`, `CSF`, `FRONTOFFICE`, `BACKOFFICE`, `SPR_CUSTOMER`, `ADMIN_V2`). This indicates a strong role-based access control (RBAC) system implemented throughout the application.

Routes are structured with authentication paths (`/`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/callback`, `/register_user`) at the root, generally handled by `AuthGuard` or specific Auth0 components. The main application content resides under the `/app` path, which is also protected by `ProtectedRoute` requiring various user roles.

Many routes follow a consistent pattern for listing/dashboard views and form views (e.g., `feature` and `feature/form`). Several routes are prefixed with "spr/", suggesting a dedicated module or functionality for "SPR" (Special Project Request, or similar). There are also instances of commented-out routes, indicating previous iterations or planned changes.

Overall, the changes in `App.js` reflect the continuous expansion and refinement of a large-scale enterprise application with diverse functionalities, robust access control, and a clear architectural separation of concerns through its extensive routing structure.
