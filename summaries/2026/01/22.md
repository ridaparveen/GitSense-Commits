# Activity Summary for 1/22/2026

## 11:40:36 AM
Over the period from January 19, 2026, to January 21, 2026, development activity focused on enhancing analytics and reporting capabilities within the T360-V2 backend. Key updates involved refining SQL query generation for various reports, introducing new Air-related analytics, and improving the framework for managing and displaying these reports.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\booking.query.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/19/2026, 6:44:58 PM**
        This file defines `bookingQueryBuilder`, a core function for constructing SQL queries related to booking and departure analytics. It supports various report types such as "Booking Date to Actual Departure" (including MBL-wise and Stacked Bar variants), dynamically setting `customizer` properties (e.g., `dateRange`, `calType`, `dateColumns`, `chartType`). Queries consistently join `mtr_tracking_data` and `agent_booking_entry`, applying filters for company name and date ranges, and calculating day differences.
    *   *Multiple subsequent timestamps (1/19/2026, 7:29:32 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:37:17 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:42:49 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:45:12 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:46:26 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:48:08 PM; 1/21/2026, 7:44:20 PM; 1/21/2026, 7:46:44 PM)* show no semantic code changes, suggesting frequent saves or minor, non-committal modifications. The core functionality remained stable during this period.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\cbmService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/20/2026, 5:28:09 PM**
        The `getCBMReports` function was updated to generate SQL queries for CBM (Cubic Meter) reports. It dynamically builds queries based on `group_by_column` (e.g., `country_of_origin`, `country_of_discharge`) and includes logic to join with `portmaster` for country-based aggregation. It also handles general CBM aggregation, including replacing specific port names and applying company and date filters. The function uses `getColumnsByCategory` to define which columns are relevant for the report, ignoring a comprehensive list of irrelevant fields and ensuring `cbm` and `departure_date` are included.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/20/2026, 5:28:35 PM**
        A minor debugging `console.log` statement was added to print the generated SQL `mainQuery`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 11:16:16 AM**
        This file handles the generation of SQL queries for exporting data based on various report names. It includes a `getMonthValue` helper for date parsing and the `bookingQuery` function which constructs specific SQL statements for "Booking Date to Actual Departure", "Booking Date to Estimated Departure", and "Booking Date to POD Arrival", along with their MBL-wise and Stacked Bar variations. The queries feature conditional logic for filtering by month, week, or quarter when `stackedExport` is enabled, and group results by day differences for stacked bar charts. Notably, the "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)" query added a filter `m.t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date IS NOT NULL`.
    *   *Multiple subsequent timestamps (1/21/2026, 11:22:42 AM; 1/21/2026, 1:01:30 PM; 1/21/2026, 3:26:28 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:40:17 PM; 1/21/2026, 4:40:50 PM; 1/21/2026, 6:16:15 PM; 1/21/2026, 6:17:07 PM; 1/21/2026, 7:37:23 PM; 1/21/2026, 7:40:24 PM)* indicate no semantic code changes.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\models\User.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:02:38 PM**
        The `UserType` interface was expanded to include `CompanyName` (type `any`) and an optional `location` field. The `UserRole` enum was updated to include `ADMIN_V2`. Validation and object creation utilities (`parseUser`, `__new__`, `test`) were retained.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\.dbclient\storage\1747201553765@@127.0.0.1@5432@Rida_Database@public\public.sql`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:14:04 PM**
        This SQL log shows various `SELECT` statements for fetching data from `dashboards`, `metrics`, and `mtr_tracking_data` tables. A significant entry is an `INSERT` statement for a new metric: `('Total Shipments Air Wise','/analytics/Tables/tableData?type=TotalShipmentAirWise','Air Metrics','Air_Wise')`. This indicates the introduction of a new "Air Wise" analytics category. The log also contains complex `WITH` clause queries calculating average transit times and performance metrics for specific companies, grouped by country of origin and voyage.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\coreMetricService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:16:07 PM**
        The analytics service was updated to support new reporting categories. The `getMetricList` function was enhanced to categorize metrics into `airWiseGroups` in addition to existing `containerWiseGroups` and `mblWiseGroups`, using the `filter_by` attribute. Functions for managing dashboard endpoints (`dashboardEndPointList`), saving report sequences (`saveSequence`), and saving metric widget sizes (`saveSize`) were also present and likely maintained/used in this version.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:33:09 PM**
        New API endpoints were defined under the `/analytics` base path, including `/dashboardEndPoints`, `/metricsList`, `/excelExport`, `/save-sequence`, `/save_size`, `/cbm`, `/kgs`, `/teu`, `/containers`, `/transit`, and `/Tables/tableData`. A new base path for `/co2emission` with a `/get` endpoint was also added, indicating expansion of analytics features.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\air.query.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:33:53 PM**
        Initial commit of `airQueryBuilder`, which strangely included chassis-related query logic for "Averagechassisuseddays" and "ChassisPUdateVsFinalDeliveryDate" reports, despite the file name suggesting air-specific queries.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 2:15:39 PM**
        Added core logic for `type === "TotalShipmentAirWise"`, which queries `mtr_air_data` to count distinct `awb_number`s. This change correctly started to implement air freight specific analytics. The existing chassis-related reports were still present.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 2:16:49 PM**
        Refined `TotalShipmentAirWise` logic by explicitly setting `customizer.booking` and `customizer.mblwise` to `false`. Expanded the `ignore` list for `getColumnsByCategory` with numerous tracking-related columns.
    *   *Intermediate timestamps (1/21/2026, 2:16:57 PM to 1/21/2026, 2:55:57 PM)* show debugging-related `console.log` additions, temporary commenting out of data aggregation, and adjustments to `reportName` decoding.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 2:57:41 PM**
        **Major refactoring**: All chassis-related query logic was removed, making `airQueryBuilder` solely focused on "TotalShipmentAirWise". The data aggregation (`analysticsData.rows.push`) was re-enabled, and the function was updated to return `analysticsData` directly, aligning its behavior with `generalQueryBuilder`. Robust handling for division by zero in percentage calculation was introduced. The `ignore` list for `getColumnsByCategory` was significantly expanded to exclude most common tracking data columns.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:18:27 PM & 1/21/2026, 3:20:38 PM**
        Further expanded the `ignore` list in `getColumnsByCategory` to include almost all date-related and shipment detail columns, ensuring a very focused selection for air reports.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:48:13 PM & 1/21/2026, 3:55:06 PM**
        An anomaly appeared with a duplicated `if (type === "TotalShipmentAirWise")` block, where the second block contained a CBM calculation query (likely intended for a different report type, but incorrectly triggered by the same `type`). This suggests an incomplete or mismanaged addition of another air report functionality.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\tableService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:35:42 PM**
        This file's `getTableDataReports` function acts as a central dispatcher for analytics reports. It calls various `*QueryBuilder` functions (chassis, booking, container, departure, general) based on the `type` parameter from the request. It fetches user and company information using `getUserObject`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:38:12 PM**
        `airQueryBuilder` was imported, and a new `else if` block was added. Initially, this block incorrectly routed `TotalShipmentsMblWise` to `airQueryBuilder`, creating a conflict.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 2:07:22 PM**
        The `else if` condition was corrected to `type === "TotalShipmentAirWise"`, properly routing air shipment requests to the `airQueryBuilder`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:09:20 PM**
        No further semantic changes were observed in this file.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\utils\analytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:21:18 PM**
        This utility file provides several helper functions for analytics. `defaultDateRange` gives a default date range. `replaceValueInQuery` handles specific column value replacements. `getUserObject` retrieves user context. `getFilterQueryByDisplayValue` generates dynamic SQL clauses for grouping and ordering by month, week, or quarter. `getExcelSelectedColumns` defines which columns to select for Excel exports, with special handling for certain report types (e.g., "Cargo-Ready Date to ETD", "BL Release KPI"). `dateFilterOnExport` normalizes and filters date fields, setting invalid dates to `null` and formatting valid ones to 'MM/DD/YYYY'. A comprehensive `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` array lists all available fields for export.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:23:52 PM**
        No semantic code changes were observed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Modular Query Builders:** The system uses distinct `*QueryBuilder` functions (e.g., `bookingQueryBuilder`, `chassisQueryBuilder`, `airQueryBuilder`) to encapsulate SQL generation logic for different analytics categories.
2.  **Dynamic Customization:** A `customizer` object is consistently passed and modified to configure report display, including `dateRange`, `calType`, `dateColumns`, `booking` (flag for booking reports), `mblwise` (flag for MBL-wise reports), and `chartType`.
3.  **`getColumnsByCategory` Usage:** The `getColumnsByCategory` utility is widely used to dynamically fetch a curated list of columns for each report, often employing extensive `ignore` lists to filter out irrelevant fields and `must` lists for essential ones.
4.  **Company and Date Range Filtering:** Nearly all SQL queries include common `WHERE` clauses to filter data by a list of company names (`LOWER(account_name) IN (${companyList})`) and a date range for `departure_date`.
5.  **SQL `DISTINCT ON` and Aggregation:** Many queries use `DISTINCT ON` clauses (often on combinations of `voyage`, `contno`, `t49_cont_type`) and aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) to produce summarized metrics, frequently calculating day differences between dates.
6.  **Percentage Calculation:** A common final step in many queries involves calculating a percentage value for each entity relative to a `max_total` or `max_value`, ensuring proper handling of zero denominators.
7.  **Date Handling and Formatting:** The `analytics.ts` utility demonstrates a clear pattern for validating and formatting date fields, specifically addressing database-specific "empty" date values like '0001-01-01 00:00:00 BC' and formatting valid dates for consistent presentation.
8.  **Debugging Practices:** The presence and subsequent removal/modification of numerous `console.log` statements in `air.query.ts` indicate an active debugging process during the integration of new analytics features.

## 1:40:25 PM
The changes observed across the provided logs indicate active development within the analytics module of the `t360-frontend-v2` project, focusing on custom view management, dashboard display, and state consistency.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\custom-view\ViewContainer.tsx`**
    *   **1/20/2026, 1:49:22 PM:** The component initially supported "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" views, handling state and data initialization for these two categories.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:55:46 PM - 1/21/2026, 1:21:49 PM:** A new "AIR Wise" view type was progressively integrated.
        *   The `selectedTab` state was updated to include `"airWise"` in its possible types.
        *   UI rendering logic was refactored from a ternary operator to multiple conditional `&&` statements to explicitly allow for rendering `TreeViewContainer` based on `selectedTab` for "containerWise", "mblWise", and "airWise" data.
        *   The `initializeCheckedMetrics` function was updated to iterate over `["containerWise", "mblWise", "airWise"]`, ensuring metrics for the new "AIR Wise" category are initialized.
        *   Finally, the `tabData` array, which defines the options for the `RadioNav` component, was updated to include `{ label: "AIR Wise", value: "airWise" }`, making the new view type selectable in the UI.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\components\screen\analytics\AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`**
    *   **1/20/2026, 1:50:39 PM:** The toolbar displayed a "Manage View" button based on `selectedDashobard` not being "Default" or `"_Default_"`. The `ChipsTabView` component mapped `"_Default_"` to "Default" for display.
    *   **1/20/2026, 6:38:07 PM - 1/20/2026, 6:38:27 PM:** The condition for showing the "Manage View" button was adjusted to consistently check `toolState?.selectedDashobard !== "Default"` (effectively `selectedDashobard !== "Default" && selectedDashobard !== "Default"`), removing the `"_Default_"` identifier. Similarly, the `ChipsTabView` mapping was simplified to `item === "Default" ? "Default" : item`. These changes reflect a standardization of the "Default" dashboard naming convention.
    *   **1/21/2026, 1:19:45 PM:** A `console.log` statement for `showDrawer` was added.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\store\fretures\analytics-slice.ts`**
    *   **1/20/2026, 1:56:23 PM:** The initial state for `selectedDashobard` was `"_Default_"`, and the `setDashboard` reducer included logic to handle `"_Default_"` values.
    *   **1/20/2026, 1:57:02 PM - 1/20/2026, 6:37:08 PM:** The `initialState.selectedDashobard` was changed to `"Default"`. Subsequent updates in the `setDashboard` reducer aligned the logic to use `"Default"` instead of `"_Default_"` when setting the `selectedDashobard` or populating the `dashboards` array.
    *   **1/20/2026, 6:39:02 PM:** The `setDashboard` reducer was fully updated to consistently use `"Default"` instead of `"_Default_"` in its conditional checks and state modifications, completing the standardization of the default dashboard identifier.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\data\options\global.ts`**
    *   **1/20/2026, 6:41:28 PM:** This file primarily defines various application-wide options and constants, such as `SHIPMENT_STATUS`, `AIR_SHIPMENT_STATUS`, `REPORTS_STATUS`, `TEAM_MENBER_ROLE`, `DATE_FILTER_OPTIONS`, etc. There is only one entry for this file, indicating it was defined or updated at this point.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-frontend-v2\src\config\analytics.ts`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 2:31:38 PM - 1/22/2026, 12:21:27 PM:** This file defines configurations specific to analytics, including `DEFAULT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINTS`, `EXCEL_EXPORT_COLUMNS` for data export, and `ANALYTICS_REPORT_HEADER` which specifies headers for various reports. No functional changes were observed between the two timestamps for this file, suggesting minor saves or non-functional updates.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/20/2026 (afternoon):** Initial codebase for analytics components (`ViewContainer.tsx`, `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, `analytics-slice.ts`) shows a working state with "Container Wise" and "MBL Wise" views, and `"_Default_"` as the default dashboard identifier.
*   **1/20/2026 (evening):** A rapid series of updates across `analytics-slice.ts` and `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx` (between 1:57:02 PM and 6:39:02 PM) to standardize the "Default" dashboard naming convention, migrating from `"_Default_"` to `"Default"`.
*   **1/21/2026 (morning to early afternoon):** A phased introduction of the "AIR Wise" view type in `ViewContainer.tsx` (between 12:55:46 PM and 1:21:49 PM), including state updates, UI adjustments, and data initialization logic.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Default Dashboard Standardization:** There's a clear pattern of standardizing the naming convention for the "Default" dashboard from `"_Default_"` to `"Default"` across the Redux slice and UI components (`analytics-slice.ts`, `AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`). This ensures consistency in identifying the default view.
*   **Modular Feature Development:** The introduction of the "AIR Wise" view in `ViewContainer.tsx` demonstrates a modular approach, where changes are introduced step-by-step: first updating the underlying data structures/types, then the rendering logic, and finally the user-facing selection options.
*   **Analytics Feature Focus:** All changes are concentrated within files related to the analytics dashboard, suggesting ongoing enhancements and new feature additions to the analytics capabilities of the application.
*   **Redux for State Management:** The `analytics-slice.ts` file highlights the use of Redux Toolkit for managing the complex state of the analytics dashboard, including filters, selected dashboards, and metrics.
*   **Configuration-driven UI:** The `global.ts` and `analytics.ts` files serve as central configuration points, defining static options and report structures that drive parts of the analytics UI and data processing.

## 1:40:30 PM
Key information from these changes:

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

    *   **Timestamp Range:** `1/19/2026, 6:44:58 PM` to `1/21/2026, 7:46:44 PM`
    *   This file, `bookingQueryBuilder`, is responsible for generating SQL queries for various booking-related analytics reports. The provided log entries for this file show continuous, incremental development or refinement of existing queries. While specific functional changes across these many timestamps are not explicitly detailed in the provided log, the consistent presence indicates ongoing work on reports like "Booking Date to Actual Departure" (both container and MBL-wise, including stacked bar variations). The `customizer.selectedColumns` logic is consistently updated with ignored and required date columns.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\cbmService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** `1/20/2026, 5:28:09 PM` to `1/21/2026, 4:33:08 PM`
    *   This service handles CBM (Cubic Meter) reports. A notable change at `1/20/2026, 5:28:35 PM` involved adding a `console.log` statement for debugging the `mainQuery`. The service constructs dynamic SQL queries based on `group_by_column` (e.g., `country_of_origin`, `pol`, `pod`) and `mblwise` conditions, calculating total CBM and its percentage. The extensive `ignore` list for `getColumnsByCategory` indicates a move towards precise column selection for CBM reports.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\util\export.query.ts`**

    *   This file defines `bookingQuery` to generate SQL query fragments specifically for data export based on `reportName`. A `getMonthValue` helper function was introduced at `1/21/2026, 11:16:16 AM` for date-based filtering. The file consistently includes detailed SQL WHERE clauses for various booking reports, often incorporating dynamic date range, company, and stacked bar group filtering, indicating a robust export mechanism. Many of the timestamps show identical code, suggesting frequent saves without significant functional changes captured in the provided snippets. A specific filter `m.t49_vessel_actualdeparted_date IS NOT NULL` was added to the "Booking Date to POD Arrival (Stacked Bar)" query around `1/21/2026, 11:16:16 AM`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\models\User.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `1/21/2026, 1:02:38 PM`
    *   The `UserType` interface was updated to include `CompanyName: any;` and define `location` as a string. This change likely reflects an adjustment in how user company information is structured or handled within the application.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\.dbclient\storage\1747201553765@@127.0.0.1@5432@Rida_Database@public\public.sql`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `1/21/2026, 1:14:04 PM`
    *   This is a database script showcasing various SQL operations, including selecting from `dashboards` and `metrics`, inserting a new metric (`Total Shipments Air Wise`), and several complex analytical queries (using `WITH` clauses) calculating average day differences and percentages for different companies and date ranges on `mtr_tracking_data` and `portmaster` tables. This reflects active database-level testing and development of analytics queries.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\coreMetricService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `1/21/2026, 1:16:07 PM`
    *   This service manages dashboard metric endpoints, listing, and user-specific customizations. It retrieves and sorts metrics for a dashboard, categorizes metrics into `Container_Wise`, `MBL_Wise`, and `Air_Wise` groups, and provides functionality to save the display sequence and size (row/column span) of dashboard items. The inclusion of `airWiseGroups` is a new categorization.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\common\constants\Paths.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `1/21/2026, 1:33:09 PM`
    *   A new base path `/co2emission` with a `/get` endpoint was added, indicating the introduction of CO2 emission reporting features.

    *   **Timestamp Range:** `1/21/2026, 1:33:53 PM` to `1/22/2026, 1:11:26 PM`
    *   This file undergoes significant evolution, initially containing chassis-related queries that seem misplaced for an "air.query" file (`1/21/2026, 1:33:53 PM`).
    *   A major functional shift occurred around `1/21/2026, 2:15:39 PM` with the introduction of `TotalShipmentAirWise` report logic, specifically querying the `mtr_air_data` table.
    *   Between `1/21/2026, 2:21:05 PM` and `1/21/2026, 3:20:38 PM`, the function name was stabilized to `airQueryBuilder`, and the `ignore` list for `getColumnsByCategory` was significantly expanded to filter out sea freight-specific columns when dealing with air data.
    *   A temporary error involving duplicated code and incorrect CBM logic (likely copied from `cbmService.ts` by mistake) appeared at `1/21/2026, 3:48:13 PM` and `1/21/2026, 3:55:06 PM`, showing active refactoring or debugging.
    *   A significant functional addition at `1/22/2026, 12:14:27 PM` was the `TotalKgsByLaneAirWise` report, calculating total KGS by lane for air shipments using `mtr_air_data`. Further refinements in this logic (e.g., handling null/zero KGS, using dynamic company/date filters) were made up to `1/22/2026, 1:11:26 PM`.

*   **`c:\Users\ridap\OneDrive\Documents\T360-V2\t360-backend-v2\src\services\analytics\tableService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** `1/21/2026, 1:35:42 PM` to `1/22/2026, 12:28:29 PM`
    *   This service acts as a central dispatcher for analytics reports. It expanded its conditional logic to include air-specific reports.
    *   At `1/21/2026, 1:38:12 PM`, `airQueryBuilder` was imported, and an `else if` condition was added to use it, initially with an incorrect `type` (`"TotalShipmentsMblWise"`) which was corrected to `"TotalShipmentAirWise"` at `1/21/2026, 2:07:22 PM`.
    *   The `airQueryBuilder` call was further updated at `1/22/2026, 12:17:47 PM` and `1/22/2026, 12:28:29 PM` to handle both `"TotalShipmentAirWise"` and `"TotalKgsByLaneAirWise"`, reflecting the new air freight report capabilities.

    *   The `dateFilterOnExport` utility function's `dateKeys` array was significantly expanded at `1/21/2026, 3:21:18 PM` to include a comprehensive list of date-related column names, ensuring proper date validation and formatting for export functionality across a wider range of data fields. No further significant changes were noted in subsequent timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Dynamic SQL Generation:** A consistent pattern across `booking.query.ts`, `cbmService.ts`, `air.query.ts`, and `export.query.ts` is the dynamic construction of complex SQL queries based on user inputs (company, date range, report type, display options).
2.  **`getColumnsByCategory` for Column Management:** This utility is frequently used to define which columns should be ignored or explicitly included for different report types, indicating a centralized and flexible way to manage data presentation.
3.  **Company-Specific Filtering:** All analytical queries consistently filter data based on a dynamic `companyList` derived from the `CompanyName` parameter, supporting multi-company data views.
4.  **Date Range Filtering:** Dates (`fromDate`, `toDate`) are critical parameters for almost all reports, consistently applied using `departure_date >= '${fromDate}'::timestamp AND departure_date < '${toDate}'::timestamp + INTERVAL '1 day'`.
5.  **Analytics Service Dispatcher:** `tableService.ts` acts as a central hub, dispatching requests to specialized query builders (e.g., `chassisQueryBuilder`, `bookingQueryBuilder`, `airQueryBuilder`) based on the `type` of the report requested.
6.  **Introduction of Air Freight Analytics:** A significant new area of development is the integration of air freight data. This is evident through the creation and refinement of `air.query.ts` with reports like "Total Shipments Air Wise" and "Total Kgs By Lane Air Wise", the addition of `Air_Wise` categories in `coreMetricService.ts`, and the `/co2emission` endpoint in `Paths.ts`. This suggests an expansion of the platform's analytical scope.
7.  **Dashboard Customization Features:** `coreMetricService.ts` highlights features allowing users to customize their dashboard layout and content order, indicating user-centric UI flexibility.
8.  **Debugging Practices:** Numerous `console.log` and `logger.info` statements appear and are modified throughout the logs, suggesting an iterative development process with frequent debugging.
